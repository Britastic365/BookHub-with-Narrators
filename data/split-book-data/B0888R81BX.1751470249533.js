window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Lord of the Underworld, Hades has decided to leave his home and relocate to earth--my home town of Chicago to be exact. This shouldn't have been a problem, except for the fact that cocky Hades is smexy-hot. I don't know if I want to punch him in the face or jump his bones. In some of my dreams, I'm doing both at the same time. This is problematic because I've trained my whole life to eliminate monsters sent by the Gods to destroy humans... and for centuries my family has done everything in its power to stop them. But now I'm the last in my bloodline and a new threat stalks the streets. Death. And he's leaving bodies in his wake. </p> <p>Since Hades refuses to regain power over the beast, I'm left to clean up the mess. But it turns out I won't have to do it alone. More gods come crashing into my life... and into my heart... warriors who are determined to claim me. Apollo, with his bright, intense love, Poseidon, the sea god, who's cool touch calms my inner darkness, then the brooding war god Ares with his fire and passion. And lastly there's still Hades who fills my dreams with lust and desire. And he has no intention of sharing me. Except, I don't have time to play with the gods, I have a monster to catch. If I fail, I may lose, not only my humanity, but the gods I've grown to love.</p> <p>This complete, paranormal romance series offers scorching hot, addictive stories that will leave you breathless and begging for you more! These full length novels are mythology based fantasy romances that feature a monster slaying heroine and her hot Greek Gods. Be prepared for heart-thumping fights, steamy love, magic, prophecies, mythical creatures, fantasy, paranormal and mythology legends, and a hell of a lot of Hades!</p>";
