But the plot twist I didn't see coming...was </b><b><i>him.</i></b></p> <p>At twenty-eight years old, I thought I’d finally landed it—the assignment to cover the Seattle Hawkeyes' rise to Stanley Cup glory.<br> <br> It should be my dream come true—a career-making opportunity that could land me the head sports journalist position at <i>The Seattle Sunrise.</i><br> <br> But instead of being handed the story of a lifetime, I’m facing my biggest challenge yet: Coach Bexley Townsend.</p> <p>At forty-six years old, Bex is a hockey legend turned head coach, as relentless as he is infuriating.<br> <br> With every blocked interview, every pointed glare, and every gruff dismissal, he’s making my job nearly impossible.<br> <br> But peeling back his guarded exterior to uncover the truth about the man behind the team isn’t just about earning a promotion—it’s become personal.</p> <p>Coach Townsend isn’t like the egotistical athletes I’m used to charming. His brooding stares and off-limits past are as intriguing as they are infuriating, and with every fiery clash between us, I find myself falling deeper into the story I swore I wouldn’t write.</p> <p>Worse still, the Hawkeyes' players and their girlfriends are starting to feel less like subjects and more like family—a reminder of the life I secretly crave but know I can never have.<br> <br> Lines are blurring. Rules are breaking. And with each moment that passes, I’m getting closer to a truth I’m not sure I’m ready to face:</p> <p>What happens the biggest story exclusive of my career, turns out to be... my own?</p>";
