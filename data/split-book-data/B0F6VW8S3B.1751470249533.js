window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The shiver of something new.</b></p> <p><b>Dak</b></p> <p>I don't know what it is about this man that has captivated me like no one else. It's made me question everything I think I know about myself. But that's fine—I'll obsess from afar until I graduate and move on with my life.</p> <p>Then I'm handed an exclusive invitation to Rumor, the frat's 'gay chicken' club that performs in front of a camera. The one who doesn't back out first wins cash. Thinking maybe I can clear up this curiosity once and for all if I try my hand at dick, I go.</p> <p>Imagine my surprise when the man I'm paired with is none other than the one guy who caught my attention. My only problem is the cameras freak me out and I know one of these times when I run, it'll be the last time I see him.</p> <p><b>Sparrow</b></p> <p>Rumor is a game for straight men to use whatever excuse they can come up with to get acquainted with a dick not their own. I'm the unbeatable—a fan favorite. But I have a secret—I'm already gayer than a pink unicorn wearing a tutu. Still, I get invited back time and time again.</p> <p>It's all business until the most beautiful brown eyes look at me and the sexiest body is pressed against mine. However, this fucking man keeps running away. Thankfully, I'm able to give him private lessons in fucking a man, something I'm all to happy to oblige.</p> <p>But Dak is more than just a good time. He's a threat to everything I think I know, forcing me to acknowledge that maybe there's something deeper between us.</p> <p>Rumor has it that all it takes is a single person to turn your life upside down. I think I just met that person, and I'm not sure which way is up or if I'm going to crash and burn before I find the surface.</p> <p><i>This is an LGBTQIA+ story. Contains mature content.
