window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Guys like Tucker Moore don't date girls like me.</b></p> <p>His boring ol' washboard abs look like they were sculpted by the gods, and I have more curves than a backroad in a country song. He can charm the panties off anyone, but I am better off hiding behind my camera lens. He's my next-door neighbor and the definition of a bad idea.</p> <p>I have no business thinking about him, and I should have pushed him out of my dreams the moment he showed up. I'd have been better off not tempting him into anything more when I should have been walking straight into the friend-zone (which I do, faster than he can say \"just friends\").</p> <p>It doesn't matter that he spends more time in my apartment than his or that he smiles at me in a way that makes my stomach flip. That's just Tucker.</p> <p>Before I know it, he's my best friend, and completely off-limits. A weekend away is our downfall, and I pack my bag so full, I can't fit my logic. Because Tucker would be fine....but I'd end up in trouble with the guy next door.</p> <p>From the author of <i>Where Good Girls Go to Die</i>, comes a fun, passionate friends-to-lovers romance.</p>";
