window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"You'll be perfect.\"</b></p> <p>The supercilious cow who just hired me for my dream job didn't do so because of my impeccable filing or my ability to type 80 words per minute. She did so because she took one look at my plus-size body and assumed my smoking hot billionaire bosses wouldn't look twice at me. I assumed the same.</p> <p>But when I meet the big alphas running Dacian Enterprises, we're all in for a shock. Their eyes turn silver the moment they take me in, looking for all the world like the big bad wolves that want to eat me up. One of them already hasâ€”a Howlr hookup that I ghosted after the hottest night of my life.</p> <p>The HR manager thought she was getting some dumpy, safe girl who'd do her job with no office sexual tension to muddy the waters. And this pack of billionaires? They're broken, alienated from each other, with only a business to keep them together.</p> <p>But I might be just the woman destined to bring them all back together.</p> <p><i>Billion Dollar Pack</i> is another standalone in the Wolfverse universe. Each book features a new female lead and the wolf shifter men who are obsessed with her.</p>";
