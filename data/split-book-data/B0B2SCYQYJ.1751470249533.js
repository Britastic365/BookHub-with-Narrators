Not only that, but she knowingly hid herself from me and the rest of this kingdom until the moment the curse was broken. Now she is back, and her desires aren't clear. Neither are her motives.</p> <p>Will she try to take the throne for herself?</p> <p>We can stop herâ€¦unless she had a hand in that curse. In which case, will we need to battle her and the demon king before we can finally live in peace? Or has this all been for naught?</p> <p>Regardless, we have very little time before the demon king returns to wipe us out.</p>";
