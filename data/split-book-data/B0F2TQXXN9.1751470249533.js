Hoping that no one will discover my secrets. What I can do. Who I am. And I’ve gotten so good at it, sometimes even I forget.</p> <p>Until them.</p> <p>The wolf pack with a ruthless reputation and a penchant for revenge. The protective fighter. The charming Brit. The shy hacker. The silent mercenary. The cruel assassin.<br> <br> They see more than anyone ever has before. And even with demons of their own, they give me sanctuary. A place to hide, to rest, and maybe even a place to belong.<br> <br> Only it turns into so much more. Because when they touch me, everything around me ignites, and nothing matters but them.<br> <br> But these wolves have secrets. And those secrets bring enemies. And when they find out who I really am?<br> <br> It’s not their enemies I need to fear. It’s them.</p>";
