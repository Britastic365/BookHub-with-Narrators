They tell me my past and promise me a future where I can be free, where all people of the galaxies can exist in peace without the oppressive Gretar Fleet.</p> <p>But the more I learn, the more I realize the Sentients and the Fleet aren’t what they seem. Neither am I. I’m so much more than I ever knew, but will I be enough to re-ignite the circle and save the galaxies?</p> <p><i>Lily's Note: This is the third book in the Omega Academy series. Please listen to books one and two before starting Unleashed: Omega Academy 3.</i></p>";
