window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>There is no escaping a Reaper. I am an elite assassin, part of a brotherhood that only answers to Death. And when Death says your time is up, I'm coming for you....</b></p> <p>Reborn to serve, I have never once questioned Death's directives. Until my mission leads me to a Halfling who stirs things within me that I've never felt before. Sorcha's past intrigues me, but not as much as the gorgeous and stubborn Halfling herself. Though the Others are no more, our enemies still lurk around every corner. I can feel it. But for her, I will battle whatever comes my way - be it present dangers or ghosts of the past.</p> <p><b>Contains mature themes.</b></p>";
