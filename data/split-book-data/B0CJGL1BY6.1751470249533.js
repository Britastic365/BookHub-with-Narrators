window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Cadence \"Cady\" Bloomquist knows two things for sure: First, shelving books at her shop, Nevermore Bookstore, totally counts as cardio. Second, staying late every Thursday night to take a certain mysterious customer's order is not the same as waiting by the phone for some man. Until the calls with the man who identifies himself only as \"Fox\" last for hours, and become the highlight of her week. Which leaves her to wonder, if his velvet voice can kindle her fire over the phone, what sort of alchemy might it inspire if they met in person?</p> <p>There's nothing Roman Fawkes wants more than the brilliant, beautiful bookstore owner, but he knows it can never happen. Secreted in his mountain hideaway above sleepy Townsend Harbor, his hermit's existence shields him—and those around him—from the pain of his past. Until one of their weekly calls is interrupted by a break-in, and Fawkes is powerless to protect the woman who has become his one link to the world. Orchestrating a trap for the fool who dared harm her, Fawkes finds himself not just ensnared, but beguiled by her. Now so close to Cady, he discovers she's fallen for \"Fox\", and yet he's unable to reveal her heart's desire is closer than she thinks. Can Fawkes resist the temptation to get between Cady's covers, knowing they'll never have a happily ever after?</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
