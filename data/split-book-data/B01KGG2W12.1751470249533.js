window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>My name's Sebastian Black, and I want to buy you. I could have any woman I want, but I choose you. No relationship, just sex. Here's my offer...I'll put your name in my little black book, and when I want you, I'll call you. When I call, you're going to come, in more ways than one. It will be mutually pleasurable for both of us. There are only two rules: don't ever deny me. Don't fall in love. If you do either, I'll remove you from my book and payment stops. Do we have an understanding? </p>";
