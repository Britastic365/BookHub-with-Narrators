window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I am a Legend. Born to fight Death itself. Sworn to act as Zeus’ thunderbolt against the darkness. And now I’m mortal. Despite having Apollo, Poseidon, and Ares by my side I lost. I don’t have any second chances. Ares trained me to be a stronger warrior, Poseidon taught me to be the wisest leader, and Apollo showed me passion to be a glorious champion. Each of them has entrusted me with their hearts, and I have given them mine as well. And it's still not enough. I need to convince Hades, Ruler of the Underworld, to help me. With his aid we stand the smallest chance, the slimmest of hopes. He’s one hot mess of a God and the closer we get the further he pulls away, and the more it tears me apart. But I need to win him to my side, to our side, and make this brooding loner deity a team player too. Can I even trust Hades with my heart, when I have already lost my soul to something darker? Hades is Mine is book 4 in the Rise of Hades series. </p> <p>Rise of Hades series</p> <p>#1 Apollo Is Mine</p> <p>#2 Poseidon Is Mine</p> <p>#3 Ares Is Mine</p> <p>#4 Hades Is Mine</p>";
