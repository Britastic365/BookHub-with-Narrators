window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>My first year of college is already off to a bad start.</p> <p>My boyfriend of three years betrayed me at the end of summer party. He said I wasn't enough anymore, along with some other things that hurt to hear.</p> <p>I might be socially shy at times, but I’m not stupid, I know now what was really happening.</p> <p>Wanting to prove him wrong, to make him eat his words, I took my friend's suggestion and hired the Kings of the Kingston Academy Host club to bring me out of my awkward shell.</p> <p>And if it makes my ex jealous, that’s a bonus.</p> <p>But, it turns out, I can't afford their prices. Thankfully they take pity on me and make me a deal.</p> <p>I have to work for them, do whatever they want when they want it to work off my debt and they will take me on as a client.</p> <p>Only this club isn't exactly what I expected.</p> <p>Declan, Preston and Grayson aren't the hosts of your typical host club. Despite what they want you to think, there's nothing innocent about them.</p> <p>They are a part of something much darker and sinfully tempting behind closed doors.</p> <p>And Collin, the school's guidance counselor and someone from my past, seems to be more than their teacher advisor.</p> <p>They open me up to a whole new world, healing parts of my soul. They test my limits and bring me to new experiences.</p> <p>I'm starting to wonder, will I ever go back to the old Sadie once I discover the vixen within?</p> <p>And do the Kings want me, or is it all just a part of their job?</p> <p>Who knew just how much my life would change by walking through those red and gold doors.</p> <p>Boys Of Kingston Academy is a Reverse harem. This book is intended for a mature audience due to its sexu@l nature. Any BDSM in this book should not be recreated because it is not the proper practice.</p>";
