It’s a safe place, far better than the outside world.</p> <p>Unless you’re a Trove.</p> <p>The curse runs in Nyro’s family. His father was a Trove and his willful 8-year-old brother, Timotei, is one too. Their blood can make a vampire powerful enough to walk in sunlight.</p> <p>Nyro works hard to keep him safe. He promised his now-dead parents he wouldn’t let the vampires find him. But when Timotei is captured by a member of the Black Court, Nyro joins the King’s ranks in hopes of protecting his brother from within. There, he finds himself in a world of intrigue and machinations that promises to steal more than his family.</p> <p>The King wants Nyro to be his Pawn and tries to take the last thing Nyro thought he might lose.</p> <p>His soul.</p>";
