window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After a grueling assignment with the black ops force known as the Alliance, Weston Brown is craving downtime. Instead he's pulled into his deadliest operation, in the one place he never wanted to see again. No-nonsense and so damn hot, Lexi Turner lied to get him to her mountain clinic in Pakistan. But the threat is terrifyingly real. </p> <p>Lexi has been asking too many questions, drawing the wrong kind of attention. As soon as she lays eyes on West, she can tell he's quiet - yet tough - and has a rescue complex that will come in handy for going up against the world's most ruthless gunrunners. </p> <p>Cut off from the rest of the Alliance, Lexi and West navigate the brutal terrain and a primal sexual attraction. Sticking around has never been West's way, but now he'll use every resource to keep Lexi by his side, safe from a killer who leaves no loose ends behind. </p>";
