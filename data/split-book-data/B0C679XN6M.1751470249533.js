The only solace he finds is watching Delilah dance.</p> <p><b>Betraying him is her only option…</b></p> <p>Delilah's attraction to Ryu makes no sense, and she would have been happy to ignore it if not for the threats she's received. Threats against her little sister.

As they grow closer and closer, so does the danger to Delilah's sister...and to the Horsemen.</p>";
