window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>When two worlds collide, can anything survive the Echo?</b></p> <p>The apocalypse begins at two o'clock on a sunny Wednesday afternoon. Strange music emanates from the sky, mesmerizing everyone and luring us outside. Then the sky splits open, and terror rains down on the Earth. Monsters rampage, ripping apart any living thing they see while powers beyond comprehension destroy my city.</p> <p>I'm a librarian, not a warrior. But now I must find a way to survive and stop these monsters. How? By allying myself with one of the beasts. He calls himself Dax, and he claims I'm to blame for the end of the world. The only way he will protect me is if I give him my body. The scariest part is that I want to do it. He terrifies me. He hates me. But something about the gruff, angry beast of a man brings out a dangerous desire I never knew I had inside me.</p> <p>But the Echo wants its due. Only the one who created it can save us now - or drag us deeper into the depths of hell.</p> <p><b><i>Echo Power</i></b><b> is the first book in the Echo Power Trilogy of dark, steamy paranormal romances.</b></p>";
