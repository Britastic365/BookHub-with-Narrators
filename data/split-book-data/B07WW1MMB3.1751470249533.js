window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Aubrey Grant lives in the tropical paradise of Old Town, Key West, has a cute cottage, a sweet moped, and a great job managing the historical property of a former sea captain. With his soon-to-be-boyfriend, hotshot FBI agent Jun Tanaka, visiting for a little R&amp;R, not even Aubrey's narcolepsy can put a damper on their vacation plans. </p> <p>But a skeleton in a closet of the Smith Family Historical Home sure does throw a wrench into the works. Its identity drags Aubrey and Jun into a mystery with origins over a century in the past. They uncover a tale of long-lost treasure, the pirate king it belonged to, and a modern-day murderer who will stop at nothing to find the hidden riches. And if a killer on the loose isnâ€™t enough to keep Aubrey out of the mess, it seems even the restless spirit of Captain Smith is warning him away. </p> <p>The unlikely partnership of a historian and special agent may be exactly what it takes to crack this mystery wide-open and finally put an old Key West tragedy to rest. But while Aubrey tracks down the *X* that marks the spot, one wrong move could be his last.</p>";
