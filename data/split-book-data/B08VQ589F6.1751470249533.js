She swears it’s because she loves solving mysteries and has nothing to do with a certain police chief. Though she’s not complaining about the eye candy....</p> <p>After the death of his wife, Chief Peter Parrish hasn’t bothered with women. But Hazel’s put him under her spell with her beautiful smile and witty charm. If letting her poke around his investigation gives him another chance to see her, he’s all for it. He might even convince her to say yes to a date.</p> <p>Together, they search for the thief. It could be anyone in Stonebridge, but Peter hopes it's the suave Italian art collector who flirts with Hazel every chance he gets.</p> <p>With her grandmother’s ghost slightly off her rocker, an orange tabby who sasses Hazel relentlessly, and Hazel's inability to properly do a spell, she would be crazy to stay in Stonebridge where her heritage might be discovered. But she never claimed to be sensible.</p> <p>Buy <i>Twice Hexed</i> today to immerse yourself in murder, magic, and mayhem! <i>Twice Hexed</i> is the second audiobook in the Teas and Temptations Cozy Mystery series. If you like lighthearted paranormal mysteries with a fun romance, then you’ll love Cindy Stark’s mystical adventures!</p>";
