window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Don’t talk to strangers. </p> <p>Zak: Tattoo artist. Independent. Doesn’t do relationships. </p> <p>Stitch: Outlaw biker. Deep in the closet. Doesn’t share his property. </p> <p>On the day of Stitch’s divorce, lust personified enters the biker bar he’s celebrating at. Tattooed all over, pierced, confident, and hot as hellfire, Zak is the bone Stitch has waited for life to throw him. All Stitch wants is a sniff, a taste, a lick. What follows instead is gluttony of the most carnal sort, and nothing will ever be the same. Forced to hide his new love affair from the whole world, Stitch juggles family, club life, and crime, but it’s only a matter of time until it becomes too hard.</p> <p>Zak moves to Lake Valley in search of peace and quiet, but when he puts his hand into the jaws of a Hound of Valhalla, life gets all but simple. In order to be with Stitch, Zak’s biker wet dream, he has to crawl right back into the closet. As heated as the relationship is, the secrets, the hiding, the violence, jealousy, and conservative attitudes in the town rub Zak in all the wrong ways. When pretending he doesn't know what his man does becomes impossible, Zak needs to decide if life with an outlaw biker is really what he wants.</p> <p>As club life and the love affair collide, all that’s left in Zak and Stitch’s life is mayhem. </p> <p><b>Warning: Contains adult content - a gritty storyline, explicit language, violence, and torture </b></p>";
