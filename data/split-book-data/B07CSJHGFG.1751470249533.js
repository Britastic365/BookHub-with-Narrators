window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>As Turner and Bridget’s relationship deepens, living together seems like the right move, but to make it work both need to make concessions.</p> <p>Bridget is realistic and keeps her expectations low. Turner could never be the true-love mate she yearns for, but he is as good as she’s going to get. Other than his emotional limitations, he’s perfect in every way.</p> <p>Turner’s hard shell is starting to show cracks. He wants immortality, he wants to be part of the clan, and he wants Bridget, but he doesn’t want to cause her pain. His options are either abandon his quest for immortality and give Bridget his few remaining decades, or abandon Bridget by going for the transition and most likely dying. His rational mind dictates that he chooses the former, but his gut pulls him toward the latter. Which one is he going to trust?</p>";
