window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Nothing is ever as it seems. Especially when you unintentionally stumble into a fantasy world.</p> <p>As a perfectly ordinary human, the last thing I ever expected was to find myself thrown headfirst into a world of fae, magicâ€”sorry, energy manipulation, and dragons.</p> <p>Dragons who also happen to be gods, revered amongst the multitude of fae races.</p> <p>Known as the Fallen Five, they crash landed in Risest decades ago, when their home world was destroyed or so they thought.</p> <p>They were all deceived.</p> <p>It turns out that the traitor in their midst, the very reason I was brought into the land of Risest and kept as a pet traitor-sleuth, was no other than their mother.</p> <p>A mother-dragon who is hell bent on invading their world and burning everything down around them.</p> <p>The Fallen Five have no choice now but to work together, uniting their five lands for the first time since they fell to Risest.</p> <p>Divided they are weak, but united they have a chance.</p> <p>My place in this battle is beyond every belief. My destiny greater than feels possible, but I know I'll do whatever it takes to ensure my friends and family survive this battle.</p> <p>Even if it means I must make the hardest decision of them all.</p> <p>*Crimson Skies is book two in a romantasy duet. This is the conclusion to the story and DOES NOT end of a cliffhanger. Tropes include dragon shifter and human romance, forced proximity, fated mates, touch her and D, portal to a faerie world. This book is recommended for 18+ due to language and adult situations.</p>";
