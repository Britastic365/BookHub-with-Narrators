No regret.</p> <p>His violent episodes make him a danger to society, so he’s learned to live in the shadows.</p> <p>Alone is safer. Alone means control.</p> <p>Until her.</p> <p>Assisi Lastra. The little nun with fire in her eyes. She should fear him—everyone else does. But instead, she stands toe-to-toe with the devil and dares him to feel.</p> <p>She calms the chaos in his mind, quiets the voices that demand violence. For the first time, he craves something…more.</p> <p>But his violent nature cannot be tamed. His darkness isn’t a wound to heal; it’s the essence of what and who he is. And no matter how much he craves her light, he knows one thing:</p> <p>A monster like him can never love. It can only destroy.</p> <p>This is an EXTREMELY DARK BOOK. Please check the triggers before listening. It is the first book in the Morally Ambiguous Duet. Parts of it were previously included in Morally Ambiguous</p>";
