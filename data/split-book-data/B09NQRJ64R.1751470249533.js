So, I should've been able to hold my own against him. Against his relentless charm and devastating good looks.</p> <p>But I couldn't. I didn't.</p> <p>It doesn't matter that our companies are irrevocably tied together, or that being with him is beyond inappropriate. It doesn't matter that he's a known player and I don't tolerate games. It doesn't even matter that he makes me lose my prized control with every heated glance, stolen touch, and dirty whisper.
