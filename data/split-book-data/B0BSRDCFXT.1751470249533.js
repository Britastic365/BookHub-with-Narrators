window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Some monsters just need to be tamed.</b></p> <p>The Dark Wolf God was a monster of legend—a shifter so powerful that he could lay waste to the world and make alphas bow before him. I didn’t believe he was real. Then four weeks ago, he attacked my pack and nearly ended my life.</p> <p>Now he’s claimed me.</p> <p>When a war with the fae threatens his realm, he tears me from my world and makes me his captive. He believes I have the power to free him from a curse, but unless I figure out what kind of magic I have, he’ll never let me go. He’s my enemy, but there’s no denying the heat between us or the bond that ties us together.</p> <p>Should I defy the monster, or could the man behind the beast be redeemed?</p> <p><i>If you love alpha heroes with dark souls, tortured pasts, and an obsession with the woman who could bring them to their knees, sink your teeth into this enemies-to-lovers paranormal/fantasy romance.</i></p> <p><b>Wolf God: Samantha &amp; Cadean, Book 1 of 3</b></p> <p><i>This is part 1 of a dual-POV, slow-burn romance with an HEA in Book 3 and increasing steam.
