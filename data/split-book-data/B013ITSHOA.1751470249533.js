window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Kyon Ensin finally has what he's always wanted: possession of Kricket Hollowell, the priestess who foresees the future. Together, their combined power will be unrivaled. Kricket, however, doesn't crave the crown of Ethar - she has an unbreakable desire to live life on her own terms, a life that she desperately wants to share with her love, Trey Allairis. </p> <p>As conspiracies rage in the war for Ethar, Kricket's so-called allies want to use her as a spy. Even those held closest cannot be trusted - including Astrid, her sister, and Giffen, a member of a mysterious order with a hidden agenda. But Kricket's resolve will not allow her to be used as anyone's pawn, even as the Brotherhood sharpens its plans to cut out her heart. </p> <p>As the destiny prophesied by her mother approaches, Kricket will backtrack through her fiery future to reshape it. For she knows one thing above all else: the only person she can truly count on is herself. </p>";
