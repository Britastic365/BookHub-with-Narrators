window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>She's running on empty...and he's ready to fill her up. </p> <p>After watching his mother crumble in the face of heartbreak, Holden believes monogamy is bull. New week, new woman - that's just how he rolls. Too bad one taste of Sabra Harp leaves him salivating for more. </p> <p>Sabra was ready for the climb from local news reporter to national anchor - before her pursuit of a story almost destroyed the Hot Rods, whose friendship she has admired from afar. Too bad they all hate her guts. That's okay; she despises what she's become, too...enough that she's just told her boss where to stick it. </p> <p>When Holden drives a drunken Sabra home and puts her to bed, her blatant invitation almost has him following her between the sheets. She's willing to let him take charge in bed, friends included - and he's willing to listen to her amazing business proposition, which could rocket the Hot Rods to stardom. </p> <p>Yet as his friends have paired off, Holden realizes that to participate in their polyamorous games without becoming a third wheel, he needs Sabra. And she needs him...oh, how she needs him. </p> <p>Warning: contains a career-driven newswoman/yoga fiend who wants to get twisted up with a Hot Rod or five and a what's-mine-is-yours guy who likes to watch. One scene with nonexplicit drug use takes a Hot Rod to the dark side - good thing this group of friends always has each other's backs. </p>";
