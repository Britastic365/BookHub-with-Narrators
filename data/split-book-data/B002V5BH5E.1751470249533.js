window.bookSummaryJSON = "One minute Leigh is walking home in the early hours of the morning, and the next a vampire is sinking his teeth into her neck. Turns out it was a rogue vampire marked for termination, but it does Leigh little good, because the damage's already been done. She's become one of them. <p>Lucian Argeneau, hunter of rogue vampires, has been alive for over 2,000 years, and there's very little to excite him anymore. Food has become tasteless, sex is ordinary. Then Leigh drops into his life. Suddenly, he finds himself craving coffee...and imagining the sassy brunette atop the black satin sheets on his nice big bed. It's Lucian's job now to enlighten Leigh on the inner workings of being immortal - and tutoring her is igniting a fire in him that hasn't burned in centuries.</p> <p>But until they stop a renegade bloodsucker from destroying the human race, passion will have to wait!</p>";
