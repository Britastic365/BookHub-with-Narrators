window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>No one's life is perfect, but Henley doesn't have many complaints. She graduated from college, landed a great paying job in Dubai, and married a man who swept her off her feet. The only thing missing from the equation is a child. Henley and Ethan are working hard to add to their family, and when Ethan suggests an unconventional method Henley is thrown for a loop. Is the proposition weird or is her man just that loyal that he would do anything to ensure she was able to have a child? Ethan's suggestion brings back a ghost from Henley's past and as if that doesn't leave her conflicted enough, skeletons begin to fall out of the closet that turn her entire world upside down.</p> <p>Killian is Diamond Cove's most sought-after cosmetic surgeon. He's surpassed the financial goals he set for himself and is a proud member of the Millionaire Boy's Club. The only things missing from his life are a wife and a child. Killian isn't sure he's going to get what he wants in a timely manner, but when he's offered an unusual proposition, he instantly knows it's not for him. Until he finds out who the proposition is attached to. Killian knows he's playing with fire, but he just can't help himself.</p>";
