window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>**Narration for this audiobook has been conducted in duet style.</b></p> <p><b><i>If there was one thing I knew for sure, it was that good guys finished last. But smart women? We finished on top.</i></b><br> <br> It made for a quick climax and an even quicker escape. Especially when you left ʼem zip tied to the headboard with a wink and a wave of the middle finger.<br> <br> Mine wasn’t a love story. It was a cautionary tale. A field guide for exactly what not to do if you ever found yourself in my size-six riding shoes. A reminder in case you needed another reason you sure as f*ck shouldn’t fall for the bad boy who promised you the world and left you with a bullet in your skull instead. Or the glorified bodyguard who thought catching a knife to the gut meant he deserved a ring. And how to not use sex and adrenaline to cope with either. <i>Both?</i><br> <br> Yup, my life wasn’t just complicated. It was f*cked. And so was the pretty boy with the green eyes and the greener complexion. The same one with a limp in his step and a slightly tender set of balls because he was dumb enough to stand between me and my next paycheck. Which left me to wonder how the dumb f*ck still thought I was girlfriend material.<br> <br> <b><i>Someone was about to learn a hard lesson. I could only hope that someone wasn’t me…</i></b></p> <p><i>*This is a full-length forbidden, dark, standalone romance written in first-person dual POV. Think modern Romeo and Juliet with a dark, comedic twist and a HEA.</i></p> <p><i>*Trigger Warning: Please check the full list at the beginning of the book. Recommended for readers 18 and older. If you have any concerns as a listener, please reach out to the author directly. This book has a contemporary setting; however, there are strong themes involving the criminal underground.</i></p>";
