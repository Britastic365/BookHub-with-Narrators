When they asked me as a kid what I wanted to be when I grew up, I said, \"astronaut, please!\" I dreamed astronaut, I worked astronaut, I studied astronaut. I got lucky; when a probe exploring the Oort Cloud found a strange alien rock and an international team of scientists was put together to go and look at it, I made the draw.</p> <p>I got even luckier. When disaster hit and our team was split up, scattered through the endless cold tunnels, I somehow survived.</p> <p>Now I'm lost, and alone, and scared, and there's something horrible in here.</p> <p>Lucky me.</p> <p>Lucky, lucky, lucky.</p>";
