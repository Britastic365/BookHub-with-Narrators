window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>He makes dirty sound so good. So right.</b></p> <p>The moment I heard his velvety voice growl that I’m his \"Kitty Kat\", I knew I was in trouble.</p> <p>Derrick \"The Love Whisperer\" King gives out relationship and sex advice on the radio to everyone, but he’s giving me something a bit more personal. Nobody’s ever talked to me the way he does. Daring, demanding, sexy...and oh, so dirty.</p> <p>Maybe we started this whole thing a little backward, sex first and getting to know each other after. But I'm starting to let my guard down, my untrusting heart beginning to think that maybe fairy tales do come true. Even for me.</p> <p>I feel beautiful and hopeful when he worships my body. I feel dirty and naughty when he whispers filthy things in my ear.</p> <p>But is it real? Can something so naughty really be good for me?</p> <p>And more importantly, against all odds, can it last...forever?</p> <p><b><i>Dirty Talk</i></b><b> is a full-length romance with a happily ever after, no cheating, and no cliffhanger!</b></p>";
