It had been such an emotional day for all of them. She prayed she would have the strength to get them both through these treacherous teenage years. </p> <p>Slowly turning the knob on the bedroom door, she quietly opened it to check on her sleeping child. Through the narrow opening, she could see the bed was still made, and no one was sleeping on it. She opened the door wider and saw the shadow on the far wall, and her heart clenched. Screaming, she flung the door open and ran to the figure hanging from the thick electric cord suspended from the ceiling fan. \"No,\" she screamed as she tried to lift the inert body up to relieve the pressure against her neck. \"Nooooooo!\" </p> <p>The ghost of a teenager who committed suicide 20 years ago is haunting Mary's family's home. Can she link that death to the serial suicides of the girls who had bullied her when she was alive? </p> <p>And with Gary Copper still on the loose, Mary and Bradley are faced with the challenge of keeping the newest member of their family safe and sound.</p>";
