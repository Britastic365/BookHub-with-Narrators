window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>They run this town and everyone in it. </b></p> <p>Ryder, Garrett, Kenzo, and Diesel - The Vipers. Their deals are as sordid as their business, and their reputation is enough to bring a grown man to his knees, forcing him to beg for mercy. They are not people you mess with, yet my dad did. The old man ran up a debt with them and then sold me to cover his losses.</p> <p>Yes, <i>sold me.</i></p> <p>They own me now. I’m theirs in every sense of the word. But I’ve never been meek and compliant. These men, they look at me with longing. Their scarred, blood-stained hands holding me tight. They want everything I am, everything I have to give, and won’t stop until they get just that. They can own my body, but they will never have my heart.</p> <p>The Vipers? I’m going to make them regret the day they took me.</p> <p>This girl? She bites, too.</p> <p><i>This is a reverse-harem romance. It contains scenes and references to abuse, assault, violence, and sex. </i></p>";
