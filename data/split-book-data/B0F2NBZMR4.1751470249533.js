window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I knew the world was bigger than the small town I grew up in, but discovering just how large it really is might send me into a spiral. Demons exist, and not only that, they have a carnival they run on Earth, full of the most vile people crafting deals to further their bad deeds. And yet, it’s in this tent of sin that I find my savior. With a deal sealed by a kiss, I’m sworn protection by the most fearsome creature I have ever laid eyes on. The only problem is, I’m not sure he can protect me from his world too. As he teaches me about his world, it’s clear that someone else is calling the shots, and I fear who the mastermind is that has control over this realm. Discoveries will be made, limits will be tested, and bonds will be formed. In the end, will the Corrupt Carnival protect me from my greatest nightmare, or will it all end in Mayhem?</p>";
