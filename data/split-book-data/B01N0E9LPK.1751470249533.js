The infant obviously belongs to one of the sisters, but how did she end up in Texas? And why did she abandon her newborn? </p> <p>Lucy Kincaid and her mentor, Supervisory Special Agent Noah Armstrong, track the missing girls and uncover a human-trafficking organization that leads to a seedy underworld in which nothing is as it seems. The bad guys seem to stay two steps ahead of them, leaving behind a trail of dead bodies and Lucy with more questions than answers. </p> <p>Meanwhile Lucy's fianc√©, Sean Rogan, has a crisis of his own. An old girlfriend returns with shocking news: Not only does Sean have a son, but Jesse and his stepfather have disappeared. The last thing Sean wants to do is leave Lucy when she's investigating a horrific case, but his son is in grave danger. Torn between impossible choices, he makes a decision that has far-reaching consequences for Sean, Lucy, and everything they hold dear. </p>";
