Plenty of heart-pounding action, great dialogue, and lots of entertaining interaction between all of the fascinating secondary characters. And of course, there is also the magical San Juan Islands. Each new book is like a reunion with Adele, Tilda, Roland, Lucas, etc. Beautifully told and very hard to put down once you start. Please-please-please keep them coming!” —Lydia Perez </p>";
