window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>One wish changes my life forever. Now I've got an extra-grumpy \"married at first sight\" orc husband.</b></p> <p>Getting caught blowing the whistle on a mob boss isn't the worst part of my day. No, that would be getting sucked through a portal to Faerie. Or finding out I'm a witch who can fly . . . very, very badly. Or fighting off a soul-sucking fae who wants to drain me dry.</p> <p>Or getting stuck in a tree, flashing an orc my hot-pink panties.</p> <p>Actually, that last one might not be so bad. Dravarr's scowls highlight his smoldering eyes and sharp cheekbones, and his touch makes me swoon. Especially since he has to hold me <i>all</i> day and night to keep me from floating away.</p> <p>But the soul-sucking fae come back. And a meddling goddess plays matchmaker and marries me to the grumpy orc warrior! I don't want to be Dravarr's wife of duty. How can I become the bride of his heart?</p> <p><i>Bound to the Orc Warlord</i> is a steamy fantasy monster romance featuring a grumpy orc warrior who falls hard and a sunshiny heroine ready to soar. Welcome to the Moon Blade Clan, where heart-melting romance, toe-curling steam, magic, and adventure combine into stories you'll devour.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
