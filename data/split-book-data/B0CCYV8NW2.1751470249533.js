Humans also aren’t supposed to interrupt sacred mating ceremonies, but I had a good reason, all right? I needed magic, and I needed a lot of it to save my little sister from the Moon Shadow plague running rampant in human territory.</p> <p>Do the wolves think twice about consequences? No. They’ve been careless of the side effects caused by their little territory battles. They have never cared about us.</p> <p>But they’ll care now, because I have all of their magic in the palm of my hand.</p> <p>Literally. The Goddess Crescent was supposed to be a myth, the power to turn a human and unite the major clans. I just didn’t expect it to bond me to an Alpha from each of the five packs, and now I’m afraid I bit off far more than I can chew.</p> <ul> <li><i>Five fated mates with no choosing required</i></li> <li><i>Slow-burn romance</i></li> <li><i>Rejected-mate/second-change tropes with severe groveling by book three</i></li> <li><i>Human female and wolf shifter males</i></li> </ul>";
