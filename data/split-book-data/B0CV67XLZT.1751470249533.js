And because the Fae bastard likes to play with his captives, he gives me two choices: either hunt or be hunted.</p> <p>Now I'm trapped in a dangerous game of hide and seek, lost in this dark, seductive realm where Faeries wield blades and whisper lustful temptations from the shadows.</p> <p>He's the predator. I'm the prey.</p> <p>I'm not submitting without a fight. I refuse to be Puck's toy. If my rakish enemy wants to hunt me, I'll hunt him back and beat him at his own treacherous game.</p> <p>Yet I can't resist the wicked desire in his eyes, nor his heated touch and devious kiss.
