window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I fell in love with Manda Baker eight years ago, and I loved her to the core of her soul. We were supposed to have that elusive happily ever after and spend a lifetime together. But that was all before she was stolen from me. Her best friend, Sarah Erickson, killed her. It wasn't intentional. It was far worse. Everyone claims it was just an accident, but I can see through the lies. Even if it's with my dying breath, I will make her pay for what she did. Fate hates me. It robbed me of my first love and left me to navigate through this world emotionless and numb. Then, one day, spiteful fate gave me a woman to fill my shattered soul and make me feel again. It gave me Emma Jane Erickson. Now I spend my days searching for the answers that will ruin Sarah and my nights falling in love with her sister - the one person who is bound and determined to save her. But what happens when everything you know to be true explodes around you?</p>";
