window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>There was a time when I had everything - a wonderful family, a bright future, and love. But all that was taken away in a single night, torn from me like flesh from bone. Since then I've hidden away in my second-choice job as a makeup artist. But I prefer it that way, actually. I'm comfortable in the shadows, where no one can see my scars. </p> <p>Kiefer Rogan literally took my breath away the moment I met him. MMA champion turned actor, notorious playboy, charming to a fault - he's everything I vowed to avoid. But he just wouldn't stop until I opened up and let him in. Maybe I should've tried harder to resist him. Maybe I shouldn't have fallen in love with him. Because I, of all people, know that everyone has secrets. Scars. And that they're usually ugly and painful and destructive to the people we love most. I just never guessed that they could be deadly, too. </p> <p>Contains mature themes. </p>";
