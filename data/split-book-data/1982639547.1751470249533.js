I wasn't supposed to see him again. I never thought I would. And then the six-foot-three cement graffiti wall of badass strode back into my life, and did it with full force.</p> <p>He's protecting me from his past, and I'm protecting myself against the heated chaos he erupts in my body. It doesn't help that he can do playful and sweet when he's not doing bossy. </p> <p>But the overly confident playboy Deaglan Kane is danger, has no boundaries, and is totally off-limits. And I know behind his walls there's a man with a dark and damaged past. A man more dangerous. A man who has become the greatest threat of all: the<i> Irish Crown</i>.</p>";
