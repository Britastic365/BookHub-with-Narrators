But Sydney Banner's keeping her cards close to her chest. She can fight it all she wants, but as the enforcer for the Lords of Carnage, I have a way of getting what I want. And I want her in my bed. Every. Damn. Night. </p> <p>She says she doesn't need protecting. I know better. My inner caveman is in overdrive. And I'll do whatever it takes to keep her safe. </p> <p>Sydney: Bossy, rugged, and hot as hell. Brick may be a former marine, but I can fight my own battles. He has no idea what I risked to get here, and I'm not about to tell him. I'm no damsel in distress. I don't need saving. Even though his hard, chiseled body makes me want to surrender...he's just not a gamble I'm willing to take. </p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
