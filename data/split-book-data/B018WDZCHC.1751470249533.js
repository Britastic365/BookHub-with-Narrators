His enemy, the beautiful but deadly vampire queen Lilith, has had over two thousand years' experience in cruelly killing and changing humans into one of her own - including Hoyt's brother, Cian. </p> <p>Now, Hoyt, a sorcerer, must travel across the world and through time to find and train the five others Morrigan has prophesized will join him as a circle and do battle against Lilith's army of vampires on Samhain in the land of Geall. But just who is the witch, the shape-changer, the scholar, the warrior, and the vampire? How will this unlikely band of six prepare and become one with less than three months until the possible end of the world? </p> <p>Following the arrival of Glenna Ward - a modern day witch with a knack for making her own kind of magic, the kind that makes his heart melt - Hoyt must find the strength to save the world, and a love that knows no bounds. </p>";
