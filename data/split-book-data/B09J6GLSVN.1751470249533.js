window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A necklace delivered to the wrong Allison: me. I'm the wrong Allison.</p> <p>That misplaced gift places a man in my path. A man who instantly consumes me and leads me down a path of dark secrets and intense passion.</p> <p>Dash Black is a famous, best-selling author, but also a man born into wealth and power. He owns everything around him, every room he enters. He owns me the moment I meet him. He seduces me oh so easily and reveals another side of myself I dared not expose. Until him. Until this intense, wonderful, tormented man shows me another way to live and love. I melt when he kisses me. I shiver when he touches me. And I like when he's in control, especially when I thought I'd never allow anyone that much power over me ever again.</p> <p>We are two broken people who are somehow whole when we are together, but those secrets - his, and yes, I have mine as well - threaten to shatter all that is right and make it wrong.</p> <p><i>What If I Never</i> is the first book in the Necklace Trilogy.</p> <p>Contains mature themes. </p>";
