window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>His Vengeance Will Be Repeated …<br> A woman’s slashed, incinerated corpse is found in a seedy New Orleans apartment. Her killer is certain there were no witnesses, unaware that his every move was seen by a beautiful stranger—from her bed in a bayou cottage on the outskirts of town....<br> <br> And Repeated …<br> Weeks later, another violent vision shatters Olivia Benchet’s sleep. Convinced a serial killer is stalking the city, Olivia turns to the authorities. But jaded detective Rick Bentz doesn’t believe her—even when a second body turns up, slain in exactly the same bizarre, ritualistic manner Olivia described....<br> <br> And Repeated …<br> As New Orleans panics in the icy grip of a merciless killer, Olivia is frustrated by Bentz’s skepticism. But soon her dreams are invaded by images of another murder. One that has yet to be committed. This time, Olivia recognizes not only the victim’s face—but the murderer’s. And both are closer than she ever imagined....</p>";
