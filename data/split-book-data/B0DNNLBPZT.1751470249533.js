window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Theodore Edward Sims was supposed to be my hot summer hookup, a stranger I slept with in Hawaii. Now, he’s my stepbrother’s new hockey teammate.</b></p> <p>When we met, Theo was a sexy surfer in Maui, riding waves by day and rocking my world at night. After being played for a fool by my ex-fiancé, Theo proved to be a source of instant gratification.</p> <p>He was refreshingly honest, engaging, and incredibly charming. Theo built me up when it felt like my world was crumbling down.</p> <p>Turns out, he’s just like my ex. A liar.</p> <p>To avoid the gossip of my failed engagement, I hightail it to Boston, where I’m forced to cross paths with a new version of Theo, a.k.a. Eddie Sims, Boston Hawks right wing. Here, he isn’t the well-connected, alluring surfer, but a determined, angry hockey hunk with something to prove. Especially to me.</p> <p>Except I’ve written him off. Once a liar, always a liar.</p> <p>But Theo isn’t backing down. Instead, he’s hustling for my forgiveness.</p> <p><b>If I give him another chance, will he live up to his apologies? Or am I just lying to myself?</b></p>";
