window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>No one blends humor and sensuality like <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Lynsay Sands in this captivating story of feuding nobles forced to marry - and destined to fall in love. </p> <p>Love thy neighbor, 'tis said. A fine idea, except when the neighbor in question is Lord Holden. Lady Helen Tiernay has complained frequently about his treatment of his people. <i>Too</i> frequently perhaps, for the king intends to curb their constant bickering by ordering them to wed. Helen can't refuse a royal decree, but she'll do everything possible to drive away her devilishly attractive husband-to-be. </p> <p>Holden has faced all manner of horrors on the battlefield. But marriage to \"the tyrant of Tiernay\" is still a worrying prospect - until he glimpses Helen in the flesh. What flesh it is - soft, lush, made for his touch. If she weren't so intent on thinking up devious ways to prevent consummating their bond, Helen would see how perfect they are together and that a marriage begun as enemies can turn to absolute pleasure. </p>";
