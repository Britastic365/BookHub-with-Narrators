window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When 27-year-old Jen is released from prison, she returns to her childhood home, hoping to rebuild her life before next year’s Samhain summoning. But things aren’t <i>quite</i> as she left them. Her home—once her safe haven—has been turned into a novelty vacation rental and is currently occupied by a maddeningly gorgeous incubus who refuses to leave. To make matters worse, an old police file has surfaced, hinting that there’s more to her parents’ deaths than the crime she barely remembers committing. With her magic still suppressed and the weight of her past closing in, Jen isn’t prepared to face old ghosts… or the temptation standing in her kitchen making pancakes.<br> <br> Devlin has spent the last nine years aching for a mate who has yet to summon him, and he’s done waiting. Ready to ditch Fate and take control of his own love life—starting with a well-needed vacation in a supposedly haunted cabin—Devlin is determined to find an emotional connection with someone on his own terms. What he doesn’t expect is a sharp-tongued, irresistibly stubborn witch barging in, claiming the house is hers. Neither willing to leave, a bargain is struck—he’ll help her fix the sensual scenes in her romance novel if she teaches him how to date.<br> <br> But as teasing turns to tension, and lessons blur into something more, they realize there’s one thing that can’t be faked—<i>desire that feels like destiny</i>.</p> <p><i>Accidentally Vacationed with an Incubus</i> is book two in an interconnected series, but it can be enjoyed as a standalone with its own complete story and satisfying HEA. While AVWAI is cozy paranormal romance with plenty of humor, steamy tension, and a touch of spooky charm, it also explores darker themes such as grief, guilt, and self-forgiveness. Listeners should check the content warnings before diving in.</p>";
