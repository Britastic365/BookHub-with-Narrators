window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Emmett Hill is the perfect gentleman - at least, that's what his PR team wants the world to think. </p> <p>Tall, handsome, and wickedly charming, Emmett is in the midst of a career comeback, having landed the role of a villain in a popular TV show. The only problem is, Emmett has come a long way from the \"nice guy\" characters he used to play and his old squeaky clean image is quickly being tarnished by bar fights, womanizing, and bad-boy behavior. Considering he's two years shy of 40, it's an act he needs to drop. And fast. </p> <p>Enter Alyssa Martin. </p> <p>At 28, Alyssa is tired and ready for a change. Her job as office manager has grown stagnant and unfulfilling, while she's become continuously frustrated with Vancouver's lackluster dating scene, always searching for Mr. Right in a city of Mr. Wrongs. </p> <p>When Emmett and Alyssa's paths cross at a mutual friend's wedding, their chemistry is off-the-charts hot, culminating in a steamy one-night stand. What neither expected was for the media to catch wind of their coupling - and run with it. </p> <p>Contains mature themes. </p>";
