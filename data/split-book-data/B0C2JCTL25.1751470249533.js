Duty. Deceit.</p> <p>I never imagined my first trip to Italy would be to bury my father. But there I stood, alone in the ancient cathedral with my father’s casket, a handful of soldiers standing guard.</p> <p>It never occurred to me that anyone would disrupt the sanctity of the moment. But the Caballero brothers have little regard for the church and even less for my family. They marched in, weapons in hand, and turned my world upside down.</p> <p>They shattered what peace I had. They desecrated my father’s body. And they took what they wanted. Me.</p> <p>I’m a princess in a tower in a breathtaking villa. My bedroom overlooks the turquoise sea, but the door is locked.</p> <p>And I have to contend with not one but two dragons.</p>";
