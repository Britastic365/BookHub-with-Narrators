The mate who had been held prisoner and tortured by one of the High Generals of the Underworld for thousands of years. The mate who was one of the four brothers that the entire demon race seems to have forgotten.</p> <p>The problem was that Varos didn't look at her like she was his fated mate. No, the only way she could describe the way he looked at her is with utter hatred and repulsion. She couldn't even blame him for feeling that way since it was her father, the High General, who sent her running all those years ago.</p> <p>If they managed to survive their escape through the Underworld, Sasha swore to herself that she would deliver Varos to his brothers and never bother him again. No matter how much she had grown to love him.</p>";
