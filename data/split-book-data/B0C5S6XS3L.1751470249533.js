He’s arrogant, annoying, and, worst of all, he doesn’t even remember what he did to me.</p> <p>He’s also my new presentation partner. I want nothing to do with him, but the more time we spend together, the more I realize he’s not the monster I’ve made him out to be. I want to keep hating him, but it’s hard when he’s made it his mission to get me to like him.</p> <p>As if things weren’t messed up enough, enter Mr. Wrong, the bossy-as-f--k guy I’ve been chatting with online.

I didn’t count on meeting the only person who’s ever been able to give me not only what I want but what I need.</p> <p>I spent years denying my attraction to men to protect a broken heart. Now I have two guys I can’t stop thinking about.</p>";
