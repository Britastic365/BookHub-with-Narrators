window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Briar Rose might have a name out of a storybook, but she learned at a very young age that no prince was coming to save her. She’ll have to save herself.</p> <p>Unfortunately, even that is an impossible task in her current situation—trapped in a terrifying marriage to a dangerous man.</p> <p>Desperate times call for desperate measures, which is how she finds herself making a deal with a demon. Freedom from her husband…in return for seven years of service.</p> <p>She expects the service to be backbreaking and harsh. She <i>doesn’t</i> expect to be put on an auction block in a room full of literal monsters and sold to the highest bidder.</p> <p>To Sol.</p> <p>A dragon.</p> <p>He might <i>seem</i> kinder than his fearsome looks imply, but she knows better than to trust the way he wants to take care of her, or how invested he is in her pleasure. In her experience, if something seems too good to be true, it certainly is.</p> <p>Falling for Sol is out of the question. She’s suffered enough, and she has no intention of staying in this realm…even if she leaves her heart behind when she returns to her normal life.</p> <p><b>Author's note: Please check the author's website for all tropes, tags, and CWs.</b></p>";
