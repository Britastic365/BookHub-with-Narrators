window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Faris is a Djinn with a secret and Marielle is the first master to give him hope. Will she be the one to break his curse? There is no telling. All he really knows is she's one wish away from breaking his heart. </b> </p> <p>When Marielle was little, she used to believe Grandpa about his wish-granting Djinn. But now that she's older, her beliefs have changed, and things like lousy ex-boyfriends and alcoholic fathers have become her reality. </p> <p>Life isn't done shattering her truths, though, and when Grandpa dies and the Djinn he warned her never to trust shows up at her doorstep, the world becomes a dangerous, magical place she never knew existed. Reeling for her once-normal life, Marielle soon realizes there's no going back - not when she's become part of a mortal conflict between two spell-bound Djinn - Faris, her handsome slave, and Zet, his vengeance-hungry brother. They both want something from her. One, her love. The other one, her life. </p> <p>Now she's afraid she will die in love. </p>";
