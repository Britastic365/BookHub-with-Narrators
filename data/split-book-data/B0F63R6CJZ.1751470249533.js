window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>If you love corruption, conspiracy, mystery, and a whole hell of a lot of action, then Lacklan Walker and the OMEGA series is for you!</b></p> <p>DAWN OF THE HUNTER</p> <p>Ten years in the British SAS have turned Lacklan Walker into a supreme killing machine. That, and his twisted, dysfunctional family. His father, a Boston Brahmin Billionaire, taught him how to hate. His English Aristocrat mother taught him he didn’t belong. And when his only friend and childhood sweetheart, Marni, wanted to teach him how to love, he walked away from her, knowing all he would ever be good at was killing, and war.</p> <p>Now, Robert Walker, his father has called him back to Boston from Wyoming, because Marni has gone missing. But before Lacklan can go looking for her, Walker has to tell him the truth: the truth about who he is, what he has done, who has taken Marni…and why: the truth about Omega.</p> <p>DOUBLE EDGED BLADE</p> <p>When Lacklan tracks Marni down to Tucson, Arizona, his biggest enemy turns out to be his own passion, his own need for redemption. A need that leads him astray and drags him ever deeper, as avenger and executioner, into the cross-border trade in crack cocaine and young Mexican prostitutes.</p> <p>THE STORM</p> <p>Hurricane Sarah, the largest in recorded history, is howling in off the Atlantic, straight toward New Orleans - and Lacklan Walker is headed for the eye of the storm. His father’s dying wish was that he keep Marni safe, but Marni has sworn to bring down Omega, the government-within-the government, and that is anything but safe.</p> <p>THE HAND OF WAR</p> <p>The UN in New York is hosting an international conference on global warming and overpopulation. Marni will be delivering a key paper. Lacklan knows that paper will be dynamite, and Omega will be gunning for her. What he doesn’t know is that Abdul Abbassi, the Butcher of Helmand, is also there, and his intention is not to keep anybody safe.</p>";
