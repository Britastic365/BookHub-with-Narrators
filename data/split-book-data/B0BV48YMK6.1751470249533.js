Yes, he’s gone into private security, working for Jones, Inc, but his last gig ended with him wounded and taken captive. And those wounds just won’t heal. The last thing he wants to do is stick around his family’s winery pressing grapes. But what choices does he have?</p> <p>The answer comes via a panicked phone call from his kid brother, Creed.</p> <p>Help, Fraser. I’m in over my head….</p> <p>Yeah he is, because he’s run away with a princess, with her bodyguard hot on the trail. And said bodyguard, <b>Pippa Butler, </b>is going to hunt them down, no matter the cost.</p> <p>Even if she has to join forces with a bossy, arrogant former American SEAL. But Pippa has her own set of lethal skills, and if Fraser gets in the way, she’ll leave him on the side of the road. Still, maybe he’s not a terrible side-kick. He is handsome, and he makes her laugh…</p> <p>No, no, bad Pippa! She has no room for a man—an American—in her life. And Fraser hasn’t ever considered slowing down. Even if Pippa has him wondering if there is a different future ahead.</p> <p>But there’s more to the story than a Romeo-and-Juliet runaway romance. Princess Imani has seen a murder, and the perpetrator isn’t going to let her get away.
