But one bad hit shattered my career and left me with a busted leg, a bruised ego, and no clue what comes next.</p> <p></p> <p>Enter Thora, my no-nonsense research partner who’s too smart, too fierce, and too beautiful for a washed-up guy like me. She’s got a sharp mind, big dreams, and zero patience for my pity party. Plus, she sees straight through my game face to all the broken parts of me, and instead of running away she challenges me to do better.</p> <p></p> <p>But just when I’m starting to believe I could have a second chance–with life and with her–she drops a bombshell: she’s leaving. Heading halfway across the world to chase her own dreams.</p> <p></p> <p>I’ve lost one future already, but there’s no way I’ll lose this one, too. Thora’s heart is the only prize that matters, and I am ready to go all in.</p>";
