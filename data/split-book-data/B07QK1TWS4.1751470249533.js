window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>There’s a smokin’ hot dead guy locked in my garden shed.</p> <p>That part’s bad enough. But now, he’s trying to get out.</p> <p>Growing up, my father always told me that I’d come to a bad end, just like my mom did when I was a kid. Hearing that kind of shit when you’re little eventually gets to a girl, but I can’t say I ever expected my \"bad end\" to involve an angry vampire with a severe case of iron deficiency and a panty-melting English accent.</p> <p>Maybe I shouldn’t be surprised. Ever since my mother was assassinated, I’ve felt like there was something vast and frightening hidden beneath the fabric of the world. Something none of us are supposed to know about.</p> <p>So far, finding out I was right hasn’t been nearly as satisfying as I’d hoped. I guess the trick will be staying alive long enough to shout ‘I told you so’ from the rooftops.</p> <p>But before I can do that, I really need to figure out if the vampire who just bit me is one of the good guys or not.</p> <p><i>The Last Vampire</i> is a steamy new urban fantasy romance series from <i>USA Today</i> Bestseller R. A. Steffan and Jaelynn Woolf, co-authors of the Circle of Blood saga. </p> <p>Grab the omnibus of Books 1-3 today, and enter a world shared by humans, fae, demons, and one very reluctant vampire. It’s a place where the supernatural threatens the mundane, nothing is as it seems, and love will either be the world’s downfall - or its salvation.</p>";
