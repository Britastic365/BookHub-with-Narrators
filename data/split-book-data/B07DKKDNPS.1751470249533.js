window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Love knows no names - no bounds - sometimes you're bound by destiny....</p> <p>Micah's choices and actions when he was young left him estranged from his family - the Ravage MC family. Older and wiser, it's now one of his biggest regrets...along with pushing Emery away.</p> <p>Emery has been walking a tight rope for far too long. Everything has changed. Dealing with her near death experience, her brother's return, and her parents' problems have left her feeling very lost in a world she thought she knew. Except - sometimes when we are so lost, we manage to find exactly where we should be.</p> <p>Jacks didn't mean for it to happen, but Emery slammed into him like a freight train pushing all the buttons he'd kept locked down for far too long. Jacks can't get caught up in a game of who is the better man, though. Been there, done that, and lost in a big way.</p> <p>When everything changes, destiny is all we can hold onto. Emery finds herself caught between two very different men, unable to keep her heart out of the mix. Sometimes we bleed for others - and sometimes the past, it just won't let go. Other times - some people walk away, not allowing us to have a choice in the matter....</p> <p>Those are the times that hurt the most and cut the deepest.</p> <p><i>Contains mature themes.</i></p>";
