window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>The Castle: elite, elusive … dangerous.</i></b></p> <p>A secret organization which once stood for protection and benevolence, The Castle is now corrupted by illegal acts, greed, and dirty politics. Every crime syndicate and dirty politician on earth are determined to control the massive fortune guarded by The Kings: a found family forged by fate but called to action by crisis.</p> <p>When their mentor ends up on the business end of an assassination attempt, he summons nine men to right old wrongs and track those responsible. The Kings of the Castle, now grown into captains of industry and influential leaders across Chicago, bring their unique skillsets to the daring mission to bring their enemies down—even if they have to rack up a body count to do it.</p> <p>The job won’t be easy, and nobody knows it more than the women destined to love each of these men. As powerful forces conspire to twist the Castle’s riches for their own good, convictions are challenged and relationships tested. In the end, will the sacrifices be worth it?</p>";
