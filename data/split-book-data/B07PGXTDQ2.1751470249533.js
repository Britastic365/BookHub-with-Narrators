Get three hilarious stories all in one big book! </p> <p><b>Book 1 - </b><b><i>Tallulah’s Temptation </i></b></p> <p>Running a tourist trap for humans in the Bermuda Triangle had sounded like a fine plan - until it wasn’t. With the Sea Hags gunning for our island, I did what any desperate mermaid would do. I called for backup. </p> <p>Unfortunately, they sent Pirate Doug, the scoundrel who pillaged our treasure along with my heart. </p> <p>What in the Chicken of the Sea was I thinking?</p> <p><b>Book 2 - </b><b><i>Ariel’s Antics </i></b></p> <p>What in a clam shell does a mermaid have to do to find true love? </p> <p>Saving my island home is a must. However, the mission is to seek out the very selkie who stole my heart, the same asshat whose Johnson I’d tried to truncate. </p> <p>Ask any tuna you happen to see. Who’s the craziest mermaid? That would be me. </p> <p><b>Book 3 - </b><b><i>Misty’s Mayhem </i></b></p> <p>What’s love got to do with it? If you’re Cupid, everything. If you’re me, not a thing in the sea. </p> <p>I don’t believe in love. Poseidon is smoking some bad seaweed if he expects me to take the one job I’m obviously not qualified for...the god of love. </p> <p>Stay tuned because I’m about to give love a bad name.</p>";
