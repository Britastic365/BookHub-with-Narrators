window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Yoshiro escaped a career of crime with the mafia after they killed his family. For five years, he's dropped out of life. All he wants this Christmas is to be left alone. Then, Ebony and her kids accidentally crash onto his property during a snowstorm. For three years, they've been running from her husband - who's been more monster than man. </p> <p>The storm picks up. They are forced to remain with Yoshiro until it dies down. And the threat of Ebony's monster remains, lurking within the shadows and threatening her safety. But Yoshiro knows all about death and blood. Her monster doesn't scare him. What has him terrified is that heartwarming feeling sparking between them. The more time Yoshiro spends with Ebony, the more she becomes a Christmas present that he's dying to open. Too bad, she's promised herself that she will never let another man in her or her children's life again. </p> <p>Yet, sometimes the best Christmas presents come from a bullet. Every so often a good Christmas miracle is a cut-up body to end a nightmare. And even better, at just the right moment two lonely people can find light in their darkened souls and open their hearts to a new romance. </p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
