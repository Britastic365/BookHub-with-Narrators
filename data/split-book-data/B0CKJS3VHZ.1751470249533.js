window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Half human, half vampire, I've spent my life on the fringes of my father's court.</b></p> <p>Born with all the vampire weaknesses and none of the gifts, I have little to offer my family—until my father, the prince, is poisoned. Only dragon tears will heal him, and the dragons are desperate for female mates. So, I'm offered as a sacrifice.</p> <p>Dumped in dragon territory in the Scottish Highlands, I'm quickly captured by Bram McGregor and Fergus Devlin. It's my body in exchange for the tears, and it doesn't matter how I feel about the trade. But as time passes, I feel a lot more than I expected.</p> <p>Bram and Fergus claim fate sent me to them, and they're eager to prove the three of us could build a beautiful life together. The longer I stay, the more I realize sharing their bed isn't the sacrifice I once believed.</p> <p>With two powerful, sexy dragons by my side, I'm beginning to feel I've finally found my place in the world. But my past isn't finished with me yet. Just when I think happiness is within reach, my family comes hurtling back into my life. And this time, their betrayal may cost me everything—and everyone—I love.</p> <p><i>Dark Fire Kiss</i> is an MMF romance with sword-crossing aplenty.</p>";
