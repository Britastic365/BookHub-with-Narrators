Until Rook invades my cave.</p> <p>Tall, dark, and demonic, Rook alone has the strength to defeat me. He chains me and collars me with magic, forcing me to shift into a woman. I'm vulnerable and at his mercy.</p> <p>Worse, he's an incubus who feeds upon lust, and I'm smoldering with barely restrained desire for my enemy. I refuse to confess the truth: I'm in heat, and soon, the urge to find a mate will become irresistible.</p> <p>I'm playing with fire. But I'm a dragon. I like fire.</p> <p>I want him. He needs me.</p> <p>How dangerous could one night with an incubus be?</p>";
