window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The Finale To The New York Times Bestselling Harbinger Series, Perfect For Fans Of Romantic Fantasy!</p> <p>Trinity Marrow has lost the battle and her beloved Protector. Even with both demons and Wardens on her side, Trin may not win the war against the Harbinger.</p> <p>Bringing Lucifer back to the world to fight the Harbinger is probably a really, really bad idea, but they’re out of options—and the world’s ultimate fallen angel is the only being powerful enough to impact the outcome.</p> <p>As Trin and Zayne form a new and more dangerous bond and Lucifer unleashes Hell on earth, the apocalypse looms and the world teeters on the end of forever. Win or lose, one thing is certain—nothing will ever be the same.</p> <p>Performed by Tanja Milojevic, Robb Moreira, James J.
