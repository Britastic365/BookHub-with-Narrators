window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Elijah</b></p> <p>Imagine coming home from an extended stay in a foreign country to find a letter from a house sitter you didn't hire warning you to get a protection order against your ex and informing you that you're a terrible plant dad.</p> <p>I mean, I am a terrible plant dad, and I probably should get a protection order against Stalker Steve, but that letter isn't the weirdest thing to happen to me today. I think the teleporting alien baby who's decided to make me their perch probably takes the prize for Weirdest Thing in Elijah Penn's Life.</p> <p>Fortunately, the baby's parents hired a bounty hunter to bring me and my new buddy back. Unfortunately, Darcy Hellspinner might be the sexiest man I've ever met in real life, and if it isn't clear from the fact that I call my ex Stalker Steve, I have terrible taste in men. I have the sneaking suspicion that Darcy's going to be my next big mistake, but that's ok—I'm probably going to be his too.</p> <p>The Trouble with Trying to Bag a Blood Witch <i>is a paranormal romance with a little bit of sci-fi mixed in, two MCs who think this is just an extended hook-up, and a baby alien with impeccable timing. The Foxily family is growing again. It's Darcy's turn to bring in a mate, but he's lodging an official complaint because this isn't what he signed up for.</i></p>";
