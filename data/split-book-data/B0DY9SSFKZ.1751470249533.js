window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Imagine your best friend invites you on an all-expenses-paid trip. Luxury at its finest.</p> <p>A five-star resort, designer shopping sprees, fine dining, and balling out like there’s no tomorrow. She swears her new man is head over heels for her and doesn’t mind spending big.</p> <p>While she’s out on a date, you decide to unwind with a bubble bath. The warmth relaxes you, lulling you into comfort. You dip your head beneath the water, letting the silence consume you. But when you resurface, the silence is shattered.</p> <p>A man is standing there. Watching you. Before you can scream, darkness takes over.</p> <p>You're knocked out, blindfolded, tied up, and on a jet—your paradise suddenly replaced with the cold reality of Staten Island, New York.</p> <p>That’s when you learn the truth. Your best friend stole a lot of money from a very powerful man. A man with ties to an even more powerful family. And to save herself, she didn’t run.</p> <p>She offered you up instead.</p> <p>The blindfold is yanked away, but at first, all you see is darkness. Then, as your vision adjusts, you lock eyes with him.</p> <p>A tall, brown-skinned man, his body inked with tattoos.</p> <p>One look, one breath, and you realize the truth.</p> <p>You’ve been handed over to Menace Caselli.</p> <p>Not as a prisoner—<i>as his wife</i>.</p>";
