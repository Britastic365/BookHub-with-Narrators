I can use the questionable life skills God saw fit to give me and be the best stalker—I mean, investigator—anyone has ever seen.</p> <p>Until four sexy-as-sin strangers waltz into town like we’re some kind of fun tourist destination rather than the most boring place on earth.</p> <p>Lysander, Azriel, Nykos, and Rhys don’t belong in this town. Something’s off with them. Something is wrong behind their shrewd gazes and swoon-worthy looks. More suspicious still, they show up right as my roommate was found, and the reasons they give for coming here are flimsy at best.</p> <p>At worst? I’m starting to think they killed her or that they know who did.</p> <p>Is it coincidence that they’re here just after the first murder in more than a decade occurs?</p> <p>And even if I’m wrong, what happens if the dust settles and I can’t keep living the only life I know?</p> <p><b>Well, let’s just hope my body doesn’t end up in the river too.</b></p> <p><i>An 18+ dark reverse-harem romance. </i>PWK <i>contains graphic sex scenes and detailed violent acts that may be triggering for some listeners. There are also MM and MMFMM scenes and relationships.</i></p>";
