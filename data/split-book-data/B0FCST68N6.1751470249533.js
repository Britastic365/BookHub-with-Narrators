window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>All paths lead to this end.</b><br> <br> Full blurb coming soon</p> <p>***This is a dark, fantasy romance series by the authors of Zodiac Academy with all the enemies to lovers vibes - don't go expecting a sweet vampire with sparkling skin and a tendency to watch you sleeping. These vampires are savage and bloodthirsty, and the slayer who hunts them will stab first and ask questions later. This war-torn fantasy world is a brutal bi*ch and only those 18+ have a chance at surviving the darkness lurking in this book. There's no well-meaning vampires snacking on Bambies instead of babies, and if they get their teeth into you, you'll be damn lucky to escape with your life and panties intact. So grab hold of your slayer blade (wooden stakes have too many splinters) and get ready to defy the gods, because this is going to be one helluva ride***</p>";
