As a man, you sometimes fall short, and something—someone—falls through the cracks.</p> <p>I know one thing; I put that on my grandson that I'm going to crack his uncle's skull. He has hurt his own family, tossed them out to the wolves, and has hurt mine. I don't take too kindly to people hurting mine.</p> <p>For that, he has to pay in blood.</p>";
