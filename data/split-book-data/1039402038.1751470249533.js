window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>My name is Vicious. God-given name, I cross my heart. And it fits.</b></p> <p>I’m a hot-as-eff, inked-up tattoo artist at the trendiest shop in the Rocky Mountains. I have the looks; I have the bike; I have the reputation. That means I get the ladies. Sure. There are lots of women out there who hate tattoos. Wouldn’t be caught dead with guys like me. And that’s fine. I’m not looking for girls like that. I’m looking for that other kind of girl. The hot one, the bad one, the crazy one. Funny thing is...the one I fell for isn’t that girl.</p> <p>She’s the good girl.</p> <p>Maybe back when she was 19 I came off as a \"maybe\", but after seven years of distance, I am now the definition of \"not a keeper\". But I can be a keeper. I can make the good girl swoon. I can be the dream guy she never saw coming. If she would just...not press charges. I swear, I can turn this whole relationship around.</p> <p><i>Vic Vaughn Is Vicious</i> is a bad-boy-trying-his-best-to-win-her-back romantic comedy. It’s filled with funny twists, dreams of grandeur, and the most inappropriate family in all of Colorado.</p> <p>Includes a special note from the author.</p>";
