window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Red tilts her head, a question in her eyes. \"He's quite mad, you know.\" I don't bother to hide the smirk that stretches my lips, showing her my teeth. \"All the best people are.\"</b></p> <p>I wasn't expecting to find a man whilst drowning my sorrows and hiding from my responsibilities in the filthiest bar in the city.</p> <p>Hatter is elusive, beautifulâ€¦ and sad.</p> <p>Tempting enough to make me throw my usual caution aside and steal him. Just for a night. One night, to help us both forget.</p> <p>I expected him to leave me. But I didn't expect the invitation he left behind.</p> <p>Wonder. The most exclusive club in the city. Always moving, never discovered, and impossible to enter without permission. So naturally, I stole it. Except Wonder isn't quite what the whispers say. Once you enter, you can't leave without permission.</p> <p>Red runs Wonder with an iron fist, a calculating mind, and possession in her gaze. When I find myself in the middle of Red's games, I'll need to use every skill I have to keep me and the men around me alive.</p> <p>She likes to collect broken things. Maybe I'm the most shattered of them all. But Hatter, Buck, Aiden, Kayden, and Chess won't let me fall. They shine a light on my nightmares, offering a shield against the grief that haunts me even as I rip theirs apart in return.</p> <p>Red thinks she's facing Alyss Lidell.</p> <p>I'm much, much more than that.</p> <p><i>This is a standalone, contemporary, why-choose retelling of </i>Alice in Wonderland <i>with five morally grey men and an FMC who fights for what she wants.</i></p>";
