window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>There's a Fine Line Between Sin and Salvation…</b></p> <p>Ellie Watt is a woman on the run. Raised by a pair of thieves who taught her the art of the grift - and pursued by a mobster who fell for her con - she hopes to find refuge at her uncle's farm in quiet Palm Valley, California. Ellie swears she's through with her life of crime. But before she knows it, she's right back in the game when she meets an easy mark who's too good - and too hot - to be true.</p> <p>His name is Camden McQueen. A master tattoo artist and a total inked stud, Camden is nothing like the awkward kid who crushed on Ellie back in high school. Now, as owner of the wildly successful Sins &amp; Needles, he's got tats to kill for, muscles to die for, and money to burn. Ellie can't believe the transformation - and can't resist pulling off one last con. But when Camden catches Ellie red-handed, the tables are turned. The mark becomes the master. And when the ultimate player gets played, you never know who's going to end up on top…</p>";
