window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Anne Frasier takes listeners back to her dark, enchanting Savannah - a place as terrifying as it is mesmerizing. </p> <p></p> <p>Homicide detective Elise Sandburg is traumatized after her run-in with a madman the press has dubbed \"The Organ Thief\". As Elise takes refuge in her deceased aunt Anastasia’s abandoned plantation to investigate and recover from her ordeal, she begins to question everything - from her dangerous line of work to her complex relationship with her handsome, tortured partner, David Gould. But with a madman on the loose, and her mother’s claims to still hear from Aunt Anastasia, she may have more immediate problems on her hands. In Elise’s world, where cold hard crime mixes with the local Gullah culture, nothing is ever what it seems, and no one is above suspicion - not even the dead.</p>";
