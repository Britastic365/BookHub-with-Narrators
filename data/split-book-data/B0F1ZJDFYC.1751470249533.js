window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>When it Raines, it pours. I'm on the bus to nowhere with a dream that shouldn't exist.</b></p> <p>On the bus to nowhere, I meet Locke Raines, who is as mysterious as he is appealing. He looks familiar, yet hoards secrets and pain, and the only promise he'll commit to is that this is a one-time thing. We're both running from something, and the perfect place to hide is in the idyllic little town at the end of the nowhere trip.</p> <p>Locke and I are confronted by two stubborn, surly alphas and a remarkable beta. If only they could see how perfect they could be together. But the longer we're here, the more my fantasy turns into a vision of a future that I want to fight for.</p> <p>Locke's secrets won't be silenced for long, and the more I learn, the more I'm determined never to let him go.</p> <p>How far will I go for a dream and a chance at a happy ending?</p> <p>Erin Bradley is an alpha force unlike any our small town has ever seen. She knows herself, and she knows what she wants. Us. Between Erin and Locke, we can't stay away. They are temptation and delicious promises we have longed to hear.</p> <p>Now, we need to figure out a way to get along. A way to bridge the years of hate and bitter insults. If we want what she's offering, we're going to have to learn that maybe we need each other as much as we need her. As much as Locke needs us.</p> <p>He's counting on us to find a way.</p> <p>We only have a short window before it's too late and we lose what we never knew we had.</p> <p><i>This is why-choose, meaning our FMC doesn't have to choose her happy ending. It also has MM content and mature themes.</i></p> <p><i>Contains a bonus novella, </i>Spare the Bond.</p>";
