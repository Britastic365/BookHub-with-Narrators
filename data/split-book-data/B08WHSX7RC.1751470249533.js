window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Xander was a dream that would never be.</b></p> <p>One catastrophic night left me orphaned at the age of 17. Hunted by a murderer, Xander saved me from the pits of hell, braving a fire that would have ended my life. Hiding me from a killer, he became my protector, my best friend, but never anything more.</p> <p><b>Sin was a nightmare waiting to happen.</b></p> <p>Six years later, a friend is murdered at the hottest nightclub in Manhattan, again thrusting me into a killer's crosshairs. Now a detective with the NYPD, I refuse to hide, unyielding in my pursuit of justice, which has eluded me for so long. Determined to keep me safe, Sin forces me from the case. Defying him at every turn, our contentious relationship finally explodes in the most scandalous way conceivable, leaving me devastated.</p> <p><b>I wanted them both.</b></p> <p>Xander, sophisticated and elegant. My hero, the man who owns my heart. Sin, dominating alpha-male. My lieutenant, forbidden in so many ways. One dangerous kiss changes everything, catapulting me into a war between the two, neither of them willing to let me go. I become a pawn in their game until they join forces in a way I never saw coming. But lies and deception threaten to destroy us, leading to a betrayal that cuts so deep, I wonder if I'll ever survive.</p> <p><b>Author's note: This book is intended for mature audiences due to explicit language and sexual content, and is perfect for fans of Lexi Blake's Masters of MÃ©nage series. </b><b><i>Sinful </i></b><b>is all about the girl.
