window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>High school gets even harder when there’s an evil god on the loose in the </b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>bestselling author’s YA urban fantasy novel.</b></p> <p>My name is Gwen Frost, and I go to Mythos Academy, a school of myths, magic and warrior whiz kids. And now there’s also Loki, the evil god I helped set free against my will. On the bright side, I finally got a date with Logan Quinn, the hottest—and deadliest—Spartan at Mythos. But I should have known it was destined to end in disaster.</p> <p>If we'd gotten into a swordfight, or been ambushed by Reapers, I'd have been more prepared. I definitely didn’t expect to get arrested mid-sip at the local coffee hangout. I'm accused of purposely helping the Reapers free Loki—and the person leading the charge against me is Linus Quinn, Logan's dad. Now pretty much everyone at school thinks I'm guilty. If I'm going to get out of this mess alive, I'll have to do it myself.</p>";
