She was going to be like the mother he claimed. </p> <p>In other words, she was going to be just right. </p> <p>And when Toby returns to his hometown of Matlock, Kentucky, and claps eyes on Adeline Forrester, he knows she’s the one. </p> <p>The problem is, his brother Johnny has a new girlfriend. And Addie is her sister. Last, Toby would do nothing to hurt Johnny’s chance at happiness. </p> <p>Toby hangs around town to get to know the woman Johnny fell in love with. He also hangs around to get to know Addie. </p> <p>But he’s fallen hard, and he knows the best thing for him - and Addie - is for him to leave. </p> <p>Addie Forrester is thrilled her sister Eliza found a good, solid man. Johnny Gamble is the salt of the earth. The best guy in the world. </p> <p>The best except for his brother, Toby. </p> <p>Toby doesn’t know it, but Addie’s fallen hard too. He’s perfect, except for the fact that he’s hands off and it’s torture, being friends with Toby when she wants so much more. </p> <p>Addie also has a lot on her mind. She’s got bills to pay, her young son needs food, Christmas is coming, and her job at the grocery store just isn’t cutting it. </p> <p>Toby is steering clear of Addie. Addie is steering clear of Toby. But everyone around them knows this is the slow burn. </p> <p>Because just like Eliza and Johnny, Addie and Toby were made for each other.</p>";
