window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Mary O’Reilly Alden froze and stared into the living room. She could swear that something moved in there. She walked around the counter, toward the living room, and heard a soft giggle. It sounded like a child’s voice, but there was something about it that sent chills down her spine. </p> <p>“Who’s there?” she asked, walking to the entrance of the room. The giggle repeated, this time clearer. “I don’t find this funny at all,” she replied firmly, trying not to show her fear. “Now, if you want my help, you will show yourself.”She looked around and saw the branches of the Christmas tree shake.</p> <p>She started to step forward, but a sudden grip of instinctual fear held her back. The giggle repeated, and then the voice called out, “Mary. Mary. I’ve found you.” Mary gripped the edge of the couch, her knees weakening beneath her. It was the voice from the asylum, and it was in her home.</p> <p>The spirit from the asylum has followed Mary O’Reilly home for the holidays. But there are no chestnuts roasting on the open fires he’s creating. With Rosie and Stanley in danger, will Mary and company be able to assure themselves of a Merry Christmas, or will things go terribly, terribly wrong?</p>";
