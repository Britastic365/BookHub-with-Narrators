I’ve devoted my life to my work, and I don’t care about God or family.</p> <p>I live alone, and I like it that way. Soon, I’ll have the job of my dreams far away from this place, and that’s all that matters. Everything is going perfectly.</p> <p>That is until Sadie Green walks into my class.</p> <p>She is brilliant and funny and infuriating, and she’s ruining everything I have planned for my life.</p> <p>When she gets the news that she’s pregnant, and the baby’s father isn't going to help her, I step in. She needs guidance, control, and discipline.</p> <p>Moving her into my house is a risk. If I’m caught living with my pregnant student, I will lose my job and everything I have planned.</p> <p>But the first time she asks me to punish her, I know it won’t be so easy to walk away—because I love it.</p> <p>Being with her would risk everything, but God help me, I can’t seem to stop.</p> <p>Before long, I don’t recognize the good teacher I used to be.</p>";
