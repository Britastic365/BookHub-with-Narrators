window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A beautiful sheriff tracks a serial killer through small town Alabama in the New York Times bestselling author's \"fun and satisfying\" romantic thriller (Publishers Weekly).</p> <p>He's their secret admirer, wooing them with phone calls, love letters, and special gifts. From a distance, he admires them. Desires them. Despises them. And when he gets close enough, he kills them all.</p> <p>Adams County, Alabama, is a friendly place where everyone knows each other—but not well enough, it seems. Someone among them is a serial killer who first romances, then stalks, kidnaps, and kills his victims. It's the first big case for sheriff Bernie Granger, and a chance to prove herself to her new partner, Memphis police detective Jim Norton. But this killer is uncannily smart. It's as if he knows what Bernie is thinking. And his next move is more than shocking—it's chillingly personal.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
