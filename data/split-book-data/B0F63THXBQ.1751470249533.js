window.bookSummaryJSON = "Sugar and spice and everything nice, isn’t that what succubi are made of? Too bad my fellow agents at the United States Paranormal Agency didn’t think sugar and spice was enough to keep me employed. So, I’m hitting streets with my men in tow, learning the ropes as we hunt down a para-drug dealer, selling a drug called Illuminate to the local humans.
