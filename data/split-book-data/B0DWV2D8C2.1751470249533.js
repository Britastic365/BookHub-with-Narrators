window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In this story, there are three beasts, and I am their initiate.</b></p> <p>The Anguis, a secret society of power-hungry individuals, have long controlled Port Macabre from their seat at Noire House: a place where the wealthy rub shoulders and chase hedonistic pleasures. However, behind the mansion's facade lies a poisonous, hidden underworld.</p> <p>I spent one night at their mercy. An invitation to their world that I couldn't deny turned out to be the key to bringing my darkest fantasies to life.</p> <p>They said they would come for me, but months have dragged on with no word. I've been forced to return to the mundane life I existed in before they gave me a glimpse of something forbidden and enticing.</p> <p>What am I supposed to do when the twisted world of the Anguis unexpectedly comes calling… and the men I thought I could trust turn out to be liars?</p> <p>Suddenly, I am no better than an unwilling initiate to their world. A pawn taken by force. Someone's pet claimed without warning.</p> <p>In this sick and twisted world, I'm now someone's possession and have been sucked into the Anguis' customs. I am marked to be taught how to serve those who have laid claim to my future. One wrong move and my new masters hiding in the shadows might choose to end my life at any moment.</p> <p>But as my three captors slowly reveal their individual agendas—as the proximity of being under their watchful gaze starts to break down my defenses—the greatest danger comes from falling for the men who stole my life while following orders.</p> <p>Lines are crossed and desire spirals as I quickly find myself seeking out their wickedness.</p> <p>I can't succumb to three bloodstained captors… Can I?</p> <p>Macabre Gods <i>is an MMFM why-choose, reverse harem, dark revenge romance with MF, MM, and group scenes. Expect a hot, gritty, bisexual, enemies-to-lovers romance with ruthless, morally gray, poly love interests.</i></p> <p><i>Includes</i> Noire Moon, <i>a prologue novella for this story. While it is not necessary to listen to the prologue first to understand the events of </i>Macabre Gods, <i> it will give the listener a better experience.</i></p> <p><i>For mature listeners.
