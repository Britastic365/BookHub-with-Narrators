window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>Fighting fate isn’t for the weak.</i></b><br> <br> <i>Cait</i><br> I am many things, but a supernatural being is not one of them. At least until a crescent mark appears on my wrist and everything changes. I’ve been marked by a wolf goddess, yet no one knows what that means, myself included.<br> <br> On top of that, I find out my best friend is a werewolf and her pack alpha is my supposed mate. Just like that my future is decided - unless I find a way out. </p> <p><i>Roman</i><br> When fate sends a human mate my way, I’m certain it has to be a mistake. An alpha is supposed to have an equal at his side. Cait might be strong in her own ways, but what she is makes her an easy target in my world. </p> <p>Regardless, Cait is mine to protect and I have every intention of showing her this is where she belongs - in my pack, by my side.</p> <p><i>This is a dual POV wolf shifter series narrated with duet voices. It features a strong willed, not-so-human leading lady, and a fierce yet loyal alpha who is determined to win her heart - no matter how many times she might reject him. If you love books by Leia Stone, Heather Hildenbrand, and Patricia Briggs, then be ready to devour this new series!</i></p>";
