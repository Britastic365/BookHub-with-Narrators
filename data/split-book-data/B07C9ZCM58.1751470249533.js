window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I'm a werewolf King who chose to step down out of grief for my mate. For centuries I've been alone, choosing to live a life of modesty despite the wealth surrounding me. I deserve to be punished. I crave things I have no business craving. And it is manifesting itself in a way I'm terrified I won't be able to control any longer. Especially since she arrived: a vampire orphan - beaten beyond recognition. My blood calls to her in a way that makes no sense. I'm a wolf. She's a vampire. The two don't mate. They barely tolerate one another. All it takes is one slip of control on my part - one taste. And I doom us all. Then again, I never knew what is lurking inside has the power to balance good and evil.</p>";
