window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>All I wanted was to live a peaceful life... but being the daughter of the Italian Mafia made that a difficult dream to obtain.</b></p> <p>My father's death left a hole of power behind, and my brother pushed me out, cutting me off from everything I had. To protect my son and those I love, I have to choose between claiming the throne that is owed to me or running away and never returning.</p> <p>I was never someone to back down from a challenge, so with the help of the other families, I take a stand to reclaim what is mine, but I underestimated the men who will stop at nothing to see me fall.</p> <p>While I struggle to live up to the expectations of being a woman in charge in a man's world, I find myself falling for the most unlikely of men who stand by my side through it all, showing me that love truly does conquer all.</p> <p>These Sinful Kingdoms<i> is a why-choose romance where the heroine doesn't have to choose between her love interests. This is the third book in the Sinners Bay series, but can be listened to as a standalone with an HEA.</i></p>";
