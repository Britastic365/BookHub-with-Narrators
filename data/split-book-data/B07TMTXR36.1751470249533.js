Now she’s discovered she has another gift she’d rather not unwrap - magic. But when her mentor, Bea, becomes gravely ill and insists Jade’s the only one who can help, she’s forced to embrace her witchy side.</p> <p>It’s too bad she spent a decade shunning the magical community and never learned to harness her powers. Because time’s run out. A trapped spirit has revealed a clue to Jade’s long-lost mother. The resident angel has gone rogue and disappeared with Jade’s boyfriend, Kane. And if that wasn’t enough, her ex appears to be possessed.</p> <p>To save any of them, Jade will need to find a way to control her inner white witch - without succumbing to black magic. Otherwise, she’ll lose everything...including her soul.<br> </p> <p>Titles in order:</p> <ol> <li><i>Haunted on Bourbon Street</i></li> <li><i>Witches of Bourbon Street</i></li> <li><i>Demons of Bourbon Street</i></li> <li><i>Angels of Bourbon Street</i></li> <li><i>Shadows of Bourbon Street</i></li> </ol>";
