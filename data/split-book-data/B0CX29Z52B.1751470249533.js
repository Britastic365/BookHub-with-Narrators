window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It's been months since the day we stood above that empty grave that stunk of burnt flesh and secrets. All of us were dressed to the nines, one of us wearing a wedding dress, a day that was supposed to mark the beginning of a new adventure. It marked the bitter end of our vengeance.</p> <p>We have done things that have marked our souls for eternity. But before we get there, we have to go back. Back to where it all started. The place I could find in my sleep.</p> <p>Hollow Heights University in the macabre, somber seaside town of Ponderosa Springs. A college for prestigious, wealthy children to receive the highest education. A town drowning in treachery and secrets that became our damnation. But it wasn't the forest surrounding the grounds or even the mysterious hidden mausoleum that haunted me.</p> <p>It was them. The ones that lurked in the night, things so wicked, so twisted, so evil, they would become the rulers of my nightmares. The Hollow Boys. One wrong move and I landed myself directly in their line of fire.</p> <p>This is not a story about love, it is not a story of happy endings. Love just happened to blossom in our sorrows, in our pain, our fear, our blood.</p> <p>Every terrible thing they ever did, we watched, we helped, we loved them anyway. Some run from their monsters, we fell in love with ours.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
