window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>\"I have a plan. We'll either destroy them for good, or they'll destroy us. Either way, only one of us is walking away.\" </i></p> <p>In the stunning conclusion to the wildly popular White Rabbit Chronicles, Alice \"Ali\" Bell thinks the worst is behind her. She's ready to take the next step with boyfriend Cole Holland, the leader of the zombie slayers... until Anima Industries, the agency controlling the zombies, launches a sneak attack, killing four of her friends. It's then she realizes that humans can be more dangerous than monsters... and the worst has only begun. As the surviving slayers prepare for war, Ali discovers she, too, can control the zombies... and she isn't the girl she thought she was. She's connected to the woman responsible for killing - and turning - Cole's mother. How can their relationship endure? As secrets come to light, and more slayers are taken or killed, Ali will fight harder than ever to bring down Anima - even sacrificing her own life for those she loves.</p>";
