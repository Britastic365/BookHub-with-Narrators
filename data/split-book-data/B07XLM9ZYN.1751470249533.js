window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Guarded secrets. No one to trust. Jade is caught in one hell of an afterlife. </b></p> <p>As a reaper, Jade Blackwell mistakenly believed her job would be as simple as helping souls cross over after death. And maybe it would be, if the angel of death wasn’t out to get her. With no idea why she’s on his hit list, she attempts to get answer by locating the reaper she replaced. But to do that, she must travel through hell with a guardian angel who doesn’t agree with her dangerous plans. </p> <p>Soon, she discovers she’s only one piece of an ominous puzzle. With demons passing through the thinned veil between the living and nonliving worlds, an apocalypse is inevitable. Jade may be the key in stopping the war - if she can find out who she is, control her gifts, and not get trapped in hell in the process. If she fails, everyone - living and dead - will burn. </p> <p>Fans of Kelley Armstrong’s Otherworld series and Charlaine Harris are devouring the second book in the Reaper Reborn Series by Harper A. Brooks!</p>";
