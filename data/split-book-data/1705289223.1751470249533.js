window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When a copycat killer has reporter Lee Barrett brushing up on ancient history, it's a test where failure could be lethal....</p> <p>As a Salem, Massachusetts, native, WICH-TV field reporter, and amateur sleuth Lee Barrett is well versed in the region's lore. So when the murder of revered local professor Samuel Bond resembles a killing from almost two centuries ago, everyone is on edge. Especially assistant professor Cody McGinnis...</p> <p>Not only did Cody have differences with Bond, he even taught a course on the historic murder. And when his fingerprints and ladder are found at the crime scene, the police are certain of his guilt. Cody's family, however, believes otherwise and asks Lee for assistance. Now, with the help of her clairvoyant cat, O'Ryan, her tech-savvy librarian aunt and housemate Ibby, and Pete Mondello, her handsome detective beau, Lee will delve deeper than ever into Salem's past-and into her own psychic gifts-to find the real killer, before someone else is history....</p>";
