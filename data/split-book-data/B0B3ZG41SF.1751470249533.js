window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Vengeance isn’t just a team of enforcers, they’re a destination where all morals and good sense get checked at the door.</b></p> <p>Every server at the roadhouse I work at knows that Vengeance is a package deal. The three enforcers for the Ruthless Reapers don’t just share a job; they share <i>you</i> for one night if you dare to go to one of the rooms upstairs with them.</p> <p>Whenever they come into the roadhouse, they stare at me. Three wolves just biding their time until I agree to be their next meal.</p> <p>But you know what? Hard pass. I’m on the last six months of my five-year plan to become a certified doctor. And giving my body to three outlaw bikers is not one of the items on my sensible checklist. Besides, I’ve learned the hard way you can’t trust anyone but yourself.</p> <p>So, nope. No way. Uh-unh. It doesn’t matter if they make my stomach flutter and my seriously neglected nether regions stir with some very bad thoughts. I’m not budging from my five-year plan.</p> <p>But then my aunt’s boyfriend attacks me. One moment I’m calling Vengeance as a last resort. And the next I’m waking up in their bed.</p> <p>Vengeance has me now. And Reapers don’t date. They POSSESS.</p> <p><i>New plan</i>. Figure out how to escape from these three men before they convince me to give them everything they want. My body, my mind, my heart—maybe even, my soul.</p>";
