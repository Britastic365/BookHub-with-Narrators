In Highbell, in the castle built into the frozen mountains, everything is made of gold. Even me.</p> <p>King Midas rescued me. Dug me out of the slums and placed me on a pedestal. I'm called his precious. His favored. I'm the woman he Gold-Touched to show everyone that I belong to him. To show how powerful he is. He gave me protection, and I gave him my heart. And even though I don't leave the confines of the palace, I'm safe.</p> <p>Until war comes to the kingdom and a deal is struck.</p> <p>Suddenly, my trust is broken. My love is challenged, and I realize that everything I thought I knew about Midas might be wrong. Because these bars I'm kept in, no matter how gilded, are still just a cage.</p> <p>But the monsters on the other side might make me wish I'd never left.</p> <p><i>From bestselling author Raven Kennedy comes the first book in the BookTok hit Plated Prisoner series, perfect for fans of Sarah J Maas and Jennifer L Armentrout.
