window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This series needs to be listened to in order.</p> <p>“We are two halves of the same rotten apple.”</p> <p>Deep in the Amazonian jungle, there is a mansion with a rose garden and a hen house where juicy tomatoes are the perfect shade of red, and marble countertops glisten. Inside, where even the shadows don’t reach, something is rotting, and the perfect facade can only hold the stench for so long.</p> <p>Domenico promised his husband that he would keep him safe, keep him away from the bloodshed and the brutal world of cartel violence. But when a guest arrives to help retrieve a stolen transport of guns, <b>something sinister sneaks into his home</b>, something more dangerous than his enemies. Or has it been there all along, and he just hasn’t noticed?</p> <p>Seth’s life is what others dream of. Endless leisure time filled with cocktails, a kitchen stocked with anything he wishes for, and a private pool in the sunshine. What’s missing is the man he shares it with, the man he fell in love with. If being cut off from the mafia business was what he wanted, then why is it so painfully lonely in paradise?</p> <p>Desperate to be the supportive husband Domenico needs, Seth buries his rage, his violent urges, and the anger that simmers inside of him. But he can only hide in plain sight for so long, and when a guest invites him to play with fire, one misstep, one wrong move, could burn their safe haven to the ground. </p> <p><b>Themes:</b> mafia, cartel, assassin, organized crime, family ties, domestic violence, inequality, betrayal, revenge </p> <p><b>Genre:</b> Dark, twisted M/M romance / crime thriller </p> <p>WARNING: Adult content. If you are easily offended, this book is not for you.</p> <p><i>Guns n’ Boys </i>is a gritty story of extreme violence, offensive language, abuse, and morally ambiguous protagonists as well as scorching hot, explicit love scenes. Behind the morbid facade, there is a splash of inappropriate dark humor, and a love story that will crawl under your skin.</p>";
