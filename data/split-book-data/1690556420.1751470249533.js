window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Once I was a fae princess with sea-magic at my fingertips. Now? I’m a hunted supernatural in a squalid shop, stripped of my power. My only comforts are stale cookies, Elvis records, and my hula-hoop. Then a lethally sexy fae king arrives and rips even those away. </p> <p>After the brutal king throws me in prison, I strike a bargain with him: my freedom in exchange for helping him find a magic blade. What Lyr doesn’t know is that the blade might restore my stolen magic. </p> <p>But as we journey, the gorgeous jerk starts to make me feel things I’ve never felt. When Lyr touches me, desire ignites. I see raging passion in his eyes too. If I give in, I risk losing my chance at reclaiming my power…and, even worse, I could be forfeiting my life.</p>";
