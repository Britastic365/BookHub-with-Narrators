window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Corinne Michaels brings the second book in the Rose Canyon series with this small-town second-chance romance.</p> <p>I am in the most inconvenient marriage of convenience ever. What started out as two friends who wanted to make their military lives easier turned into a mess. Why? Because I stupidly fell in love with my husband. </p> <p>In an attempt to remedy my mistake, I severed all ties and put my life as a combat medic and Emmett Maxwell behind me. I’ve lost too many people to open myself up to love. </p> <p>Now I’m working as a private investigator, and fate has stepped in, forcing our paths to intersect again when I’m looking into the disappearance of a missing girl with ties to Emmett’s hometown. A case I fear puts his life in danger. </p> <p>He gives me one week to prove my suspicions and then I need to sign the divorce papers and leave. The problem with that? The moment I see Emmett again, I realize how foolish it was to leave him, to think I could ever stop loving him. </p> <p>When the case threatens not only my life but also his, I’m faced with my worst fear. How many times can a heart break before it shatters beyond repair?</p>";
