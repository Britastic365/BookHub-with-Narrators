A betrayal so deep it will echo through eternity.</p> <p>Ophelia Hart is no ordinary elementai. In fact, she is extraordinary in every single way there is.</p> <p>And now that she knows her true heritage and has bonded to the most powerful vampire who ever lived, and the three ruthless vampires he sired, she wonders if she might finally know some true happiness.

And although her four bonded mates will do all in their power to protect her, there are forces at work that even they cannot fathom.</p> <p>Destiny beckons, but betrayal lurks just around the corner. And debts will be settled for oaths that are PROMISED IN BLOOD.</p> <p><b>Please note: Promised in Blood ends in a cliffhanger, but Book 3 in the trilogy will have the HEA you’re waiting for.</b></p>";
