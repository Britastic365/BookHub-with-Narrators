window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the gutter to the stars....</b></p> <p>Dance has always been the answer to everything. It soothed my soul, it kept me sane, and it gave me purpose. It brought the Breakers back to me. It healed us. This time, dance isn’t enough. It’s time to face our enemies. It’s time I fight back. But at what cost? My soul? The death of everyone I care about?</p> <p>All I can be certain of is this: I’m willing to do anything to protect the people I love, even become a monster. This time there will be no rehearsals, just our grand finale. I pray it won’t be our last.</p> <p><i>Finale</i> is book four of Academy of Stardom, a gritty, contemporary reverse-harem romance. If you love dance, your men on the criminal side, hot alpha-holes, and the friends-to-enemies-to-lovers trope, this is for you. Contains mature themes and ends on a cliff-hanger.</p>";
