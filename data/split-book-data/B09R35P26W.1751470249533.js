window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Mia.</p> <p>It was so close, I'd tasted it - the freedom. But the only thing I could taste now was the end. Over the last two years, I’d let all outside forces dictate my life, my feelings, my head. I’d allowed everyone to control what my punishment should be for all my wrong-doings. I’d been tested and learned my lesson. I’d paid my dues and suffered long enough. Because in the end, even the once-upon-a-damned deserved to be happy too.</p> <p>Ollie.</p> <p>How far are you willing to go? I’d asked myself this very question countless times. But never in my wildest dreams thought I’d go back in time, chasing ghosts from my past for a chance to save our future. So, there was no limit. No boundaries. I’d cross time, the world, my morals. Yes, I’d even double-cross myself. So, how far would I go? The answer had always been simple. I’d go an eternity plus a day past crestfallen.</p>";
