window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>He can resurrect the dead, but can he get the girl?</b></p> <p>The fae Tris can't seem to find his place in the world—either world, mortal or elemental. All his friends are married, but he can't get a date, much less get laid. When he bumps into a hot girl, she's not interested in sex or dating. Riley Jordan calls herself a cryptozoologist and only wants to follow Tris around to study him in his \"natural habitat\"—whether he likes it or not.</p> <p>Maybe he wouldn't mind if she'd let him kiss her. But after one hot lip-lock, she puts her foot down.</p> <p>Now a series of bizarre disasters has led Tris to suspect he's been cursed. After all, he is the 13th child in his family, born on the 13th day of the 13th month in the fae calendar. He might also have accidentally ticked off a few too many elementals. Add in his job as the guardian of a coveted healing vortex, and yeah, he's screwed.</p> <p><b><i>The Thirteenth Fae</i></b><b> is the sixth book in the Undercover Elementals series of steamy paranormal romances.</b></p>";
