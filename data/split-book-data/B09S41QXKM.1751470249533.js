window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>One sassy pyromaniac thief, four sexy-as-sin monsters, and a paranormal conspiracy of epic proportions.</b></p> <p>I make a living out of screwing over the jerks who capture and torment supernatural beasties. But when I free a bunch of particularly powerful monsters from their cages, I'm not counting on them following me home like lost puppies.</p> <p>Stunningly hot lost puppies, but still.</p> <p>These manly monsters are determined to repay me for my help, and they won't get out of my apartment until they're satisfied we're even. And when I find out they're up against the same creeps who murdered the person I love most, I'm all for joining forces. There's something to be said for allies so devoted they'll tear off heads and shred souls on your behalf.</p> <p>Especially when I realize I'm developing an unsettling supernatural power that no mortal is supposed to wield.</p> <p>Track down the baddies.</p> <p>Tame my destructive talents.</p> <p>Don't get killed along the way.</p> <p>Oh, and maybe hook up with a monstrous hottie or four.</p> <p>Piece of cake.</p> <p>I'm so going to regret this.</p> <p>*Flirting with Monsters is a light-hearted, action-packed urban fantasy series with plenty of sass and steam.
