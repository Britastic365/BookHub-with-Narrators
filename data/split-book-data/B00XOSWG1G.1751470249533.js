window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Welcome to Willow Creek. People are happy, crime is practically nonexistent, and life is good...unless you're Sabine Crowley. Sabine has been chosen to be the next blood bag for the vampire lord who has protected the town from otherworldly creatures for 200 years. </p> <p>Sabine has big dreams for her life, and none of them include becoming a vampire's concubine. On her 18th birthday, she seeks solitude to process the cruel turn her destiny has taken. As she sits alone in Cleary Park, a sexy stranger approaches her. He's tall, mysterious, handsome, and a complete jerk. He soon reveals himself to be a vampire; Sabine is terrified of him and her strange attraction to him. She wants to get as far away from him as possible, yet finds herself wondering if she'll see him again. </p> <p>Remy, the cocky newcomer vampire, has been summoned by his maker, Bastian, to take his place beside his maker in the hierarchy of vampires inhabiting Willow Creek. He's none too thrilled to be stuck in a boring little town in the middle of nowhere, where he'll have to feed exclusively from the girl he's been paired with. He's repulsed by the whole situation. </p> <p>When Sabine tries to run away from her fate, Remy is forced to follow her and bring her back. They're unwillingly thrust into each other's lives and, reluctantly, find an undeniable attraction between themselves. Will they ever look past their contempt for one another and act on their urges? Or are they destined to hate each other forever? </p>";
