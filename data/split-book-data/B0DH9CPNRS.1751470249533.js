window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Gemini \"Gemma\" McKendrick knows just about everything about everybody in Townsend Harbor. With her quirky boutique in big financial trouble, she makes a snap decision to rent out the basement of her cozy craftsman to Townsend Harbor newcomer Gabe Kelly. A man with a past as colorful as his tattoo sleeves, who has become an urban legend since he blew into town. And who better than Gemma, Townsend Harbor's own gossip guru, to answer the rumor mill's most pressing questions?</p> <p>Gabriel \"Gabe\" Kelly wasn't born into a family so much as a criminal enterprise. Moonlighting as the only tow truck in a thirty-mile radius, he rescues the absent-minded hottie who runs the local yarn shop. But he quickly discovers that a toy-sized car with a dashboard lit up by Christmas isn't the only thing in Gemma McKendrick's life desperately in need of maintenance. Gabe finds his sexy landlord is impossible to figure out. Looks like he'll have to take a peek at her undercarriage to find out what makes her purr before he hits the road again. Because women of her caliber don't take home guys with his make and model . . .</p> <p>But he knows she wants a test drive.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
