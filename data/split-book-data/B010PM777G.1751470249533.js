window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>As the planner for the Hot Rods' quadruple wedding - one of which involves her sister, Nola - Amber Brown needs every ounce of her formidable attention to detail. Which is just fine with her. </p> <p>She's a teensy bit envious of the raw sexual power contained within Hot Rods' polyamorous circle. But after watching her mother suffer the heartache of her father's death, Amber won't risk her heart, not even for the super-sexy lawyer on the guest list. </p> <p>Gavyn has handled enough divorce cases to witness the horrors people who supposedly love each other can inflict. Yet when he assists Amber with the wedding prep in exchange for her advice on his new venture, it's hard to ignore the steam rising between them. </p> <p>Finally they agree to a single night of strings-free sex. Except one taste isn't enough to curb their hunger...until Amber makes a shocking discovery that sours her appetite for the man she thought could satisfy her for a lifetime and leaves Gavyn negotiating desperately for a future he never thought he craved. </p>";
