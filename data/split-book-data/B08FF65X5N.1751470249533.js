window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>USA Today</i></b><b> best-selling author Marie Force comes a steamy new contemporary romance about two strangers who find love in the most unexpected way - by saving a life. </b></p> <p><i>Austin </i></p> <p>Sitting at the top of my game, pitching for Baltimore and a single daddy to the most adorable little girl in the world, I’m living the dream. Until I get the dreaded call that Everly is sick. My entire world stops when the doctors say the only chance my baby has is through a bone-marrow transplant. My life becomes a living nightmare as I wage a war to save my daughter. Nothing else matters. Not my Cy Young Award, not my career, not my team or my talent. None of that can fix her. She needs a miracle. What we get is a stranger...and Maria just might save us both. </p> <p><i>Maria</i></p> <p>My life in Miami might not be glamorous, but it is rewarding. I divide my time between working as a nurse at a free clinic and waitressing at my family’s Cuban-Italian restaurant. After being cheated on by my long-time boyfriend, I’m not exactly looking for Mr. Right but wouldn’t kick him out of bed if he suddenly showed up. Six months after I donated bone marrow to a little girl in Baltimore, I get an email from the child’s grateful father, but everything is anonymous until the one-year mark. I’m desperate to know more about him. The last thing I expect him to be is a gorgeous, famous ballplayer. One email becomes another, until we find ourselves caught up in a friendship neither of us expected, but both desperately need. I’m falling in love with a man I’ve never met. </p> <p>Listen to the exciting sequel to <i>How Much I Feel</i> to find out what happens when Austin is scheduled to play in Miami, and the team arranges a meeting between Austin, Everly, and Maria.</p>";
