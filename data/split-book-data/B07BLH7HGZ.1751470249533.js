But who will keep the throne? <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Katee Robert introduces a red-hot new series.</p> <p><b>The man she hates to love</b></p> <p>Beckett King just inherited his father's fortune, his company - and all his enemies. If he's going to stay on top, he needs someone he can trust beside him. And though they've been rivals for years, there's no one he trusts more than Samara Mallick.</p> <p>The rebel. That's how Samara has always thought of Beckett. And he's absolutely living up to his unpredictable ways when he strides into her office and asks for help. She can't help wondering if it's a legit request or just a ploy to get her into bed. Not that she'd mind either one. After all, she likes to live on the edge too.</p> <p>But soon the threats to the King empire are mounting, and the two find family secrets darker than they ever imagined and dangerous enough to get them both killed.</p>";
