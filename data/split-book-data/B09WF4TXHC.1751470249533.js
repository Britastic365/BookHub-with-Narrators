window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Treacherous, sexy, and highly addictive. USA Today bestselling author Ella Fields delivers the conclusion to Audra’s story in this fast-paced dark fantasy romance.</p> <p>Never has there been a fury like that of a mated male.</p> <p>Though my arranged marriage to the king resulted in heartache, the continent of Rosinthe continued to heal.</p> <p>It was my duty to ensure the stains my father left in his wake were wiped clean. If that meant remaining married to a male who’d betrayed me, then so be it.</p> <p>With peace flourishing and my lover, the lord of the east, at my side, the sticky web we’d found ourselves in became easier to navigate.</p> <p>Until a faerie king stole into my dreams, marring harmony with uncertainty.</p> <p>Before I could make sense of what was happening, I was lured and captured, taken to a realm across the sea. To a land unlike any other that had been locked unto itself for years.</p> <p>Beldine.</p> <p>I’d broken my father’s curse, erasing the block that had kept its creatures contained, and in doing so, had almost lost my life.</p> <p>Now their high king wants more than answers. He and his realm are in need of something else, and he’ll stop at nothing to retrieve it.</p> <p>Hearts will break. Blood will spill. Desire will destroy. When two worlds collide, can love endure when vengeance must reign?</p>";
