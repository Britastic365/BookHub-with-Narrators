window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>An ancient war, a tenuous truce, a delicate balance.</p> <p>Sounds ominous right? It is.</p> <p>The tri-pack collective has existed for centuriesâ€”three dire wolf packs bound to the most powerful coven in the world through a single witch born under the thirteenth sign of the zodiac. Through this covenant they keep an ancient threat unlike any other at bay.</p> <p>At the next blood moon, I'll be that witch-bound to the three leaders of the dire wolf packs. Responsible for keeping the peace. That is if I make it to the blood moon alive, because someone is trying to kill me.</p> <p>Now the hot-headed wolves are going to have to work together to make sure our inventive little murderer doesn't succeed.</p> <p>And me? Well, I don't take kindly to being targeted, so whoever's gunning for me better watch out, because they just became the hunted.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
