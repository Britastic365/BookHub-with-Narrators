window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Your Inescapable Love</i></p> <p>After being left at the altar, I have sworn off men. Until the childhood friend I hero-worshipped steps into my clinic. Max is every bit the troublemaker I remember, only now he has a body to drool over and a smile to melt my panties. Can I give in to his demands without risking my heart?</p> <p><i>Your Tempting Love</i></p> <p>Raising my much younger siblings isn't a piece of cake, and I can't afford any mistakes . . . especially not the sexy kind, and especially not with my clients. I'm determined not to fall under Christopher's spell, even though the man is hotter than sin, and his flirty banter makes my toes curl. I don't think I'll be able to stay away from him, even though this has disaster written all over it.</p> <p><i>Your Alluring Love</i></p> <p>I've been holding a torch for my older brother's best friend for more than a decade. Nate is a hotshot TV producer who travels the world, never staying in San Francisco for too long. But now he's in town and just as tempting as ever. But Nate gets the chance of a lifetime that will take him away again, and I own a restaurant. I can't just follow him everywhere. Time to pour a bucket of ice over that blazing torch I've been holding.</p>";
