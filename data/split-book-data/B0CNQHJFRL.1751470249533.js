window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Everything’s been upside down since I helped Maya and the Faithful with the Rojo clan: Luna said no when I offered to turn her as per our arrangement, a sentiment I agree with but don’t understand—and Sam, my “favorite” Faithful, is telling me, an unholy being, to stay “topped up.” And if there’s a hell for vampires, I’m living in it: Paco hasn’t come back since I turned him, and I need to break up with an all-too-human Zach for his own well-being. When Luna’s kidnapped by a cult attempting to summon the Sleeper, I have absolute proof that it’s safer for everyone for me to be alone—but I’m going to need Paco’s help to find her, because he’s the only one who knows what her blood tastes like. Will Paco forgive me for making him what I am, and will I get another chance to change Luna before she becomes a human sacrifice?</p>";
