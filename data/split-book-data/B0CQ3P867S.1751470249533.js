I will be unabashedly devoted to making you happy. The choice will always have to be yours. But if you continue to choose me? I promise to give you everything I am, everything I will ever be, everything you can even imagine. There will never be a moment of your life where you will ever question where I stand with you, how I feel, or whether I choose you. But I’ll never ask, Jhorie. I can’t. The choice will always have to be yours.”—Ezekiel</p> <p>“You’ll never have to ask because the decision has already been made. I’ve already chosen you, Ezekiel, and my choice is never changing.”—Jhorie</p> <p>This is our story…</p> <p>Note: Dawning and Resurgence is a standalone novel that can be listened to alone; however, for a better listening experience, it’s best to begin with Shadows and Whispers.</p>";
