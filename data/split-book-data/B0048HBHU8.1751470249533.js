But being half-human, half-Fae means our supernatural talents can go haywire at any time. My sister Camille is a wicked good witch whose life recently took a drastic turn. Menolly's a vampire who's still getting the hang of being undead. And me? I'm Delilah, a werecat with a very interesting love life. But life isn't all fun and games. We're on the trail of the demon general who has decided that we've become quite a nuisance. </p><p>\"It's Samhain, and the Autumn Lord has called for my training to begin with the Death Maidens...and I find that I like it. But we've got problems: werewolves are going missing, and a new magical drug, 'Wolf Briar', is being used as a weapon. My dear Chase and I have come to a delicate crossroads, and there's no turning back from our decision. And most dangerous of all: Stacia Bonecrusher has put a bounty on our heads. Now it's a race to take out the demon general before she realizes the sixth Spirit Seal is within her reach.\"</p>";
