window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The scariest school on earth is about to experience real fear....</p> <p>Most schools are about being the best. This school? It's about being the worst. Calder Academy is where the rogue paranormals go. The ones who break the rules or lose control. And when that happens for vamps, werewolves, witches, and dark fae? It gets pretty freaking scary.</p> <p>I should know. Because I'm trapped here.</p> <p>Look, every seventeen-year-old girl thinks their mom is a tyrant. But mine just happens to run Calder Academy, which paints a giant target on my back. The way I make it through these dark halls is by steering clear of the things—and kids—who go bump in the night.</p> <p>Especially Jude Abernathy-Lee.</p> <p>But when a freak storm hits our isolated island, I'm stuck without a backup plan. The power is gone. The lights are out. And our worst nightmares are suddenly real—and out for blood. Now, the only way to survive is to align myself with one evil to avoid the other.</p> <p>And the only thing worse than the idea of getting close to Jude? Secretly loving every minute of it.</p>";
