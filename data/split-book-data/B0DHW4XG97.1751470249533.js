window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Wild things have tails, hatred always fails, and the forest knows me too well. That's why I need this magic...</b></p> <p>Magic is a gift. A pretty miraculous one, in my opinion. It also comes with responsibilities—things like protecting the town that made this possible. Sadly, that means my last battle with the evil coven may have caused a tiny little problem.</p> <p>The spell that protects this place is fading. My power is fine, but a magical ritual like that takes six wixen to make possible. That means I have two choices: I can either let it fade or work with the assholes I just pissed off.</p> <p>Or, maybe I can find a third option?</p> <p>The old coven wants me gone. Worse, they're after Zane as well. With the spell fading, the only safe place left is in the forest. And while my house is starting to get a little crowded, the things happening inside are a very different kind of magic. The kind that makes me realize all of this is worth fighting for.</p> <p>Who cares if I don't like confrontation? If I want to keep the idealistic life I've been offered, I need to get over that. Otherwise, someone's going to die—and it might be one of my guys.</p> <p>The battle lines are drawn. It's my coven against theirs. So let it be.</p> <p>Witchcraft In The Woods <i>is the last book in the Where The Wild Things Grow series, set in the larger Moonlight Universe. For mature listeners.</i></p>";
