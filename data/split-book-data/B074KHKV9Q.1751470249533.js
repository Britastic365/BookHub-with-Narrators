Mr. McAlister was full of smooth charm, but back then he was barely a blip on my radar. Just a family friend. </p> <p>Fast forward 10 years: I'm 25 years old and a single mom trying to make things right for her seven-year-old son. I've made some mistakes, grappled with my demons, and now I'm back in the city of Vancouver, getting a second chance at a better life. </p> <p>I've started by working for my father's production company as an executive assistant. My first day on the job and I already know I could have a promising career there. </p> <p>That is, until I see Will McAlister for the first time in a decade. </p> <p>Now recently divorced and as sophisticated as always, Will has gone from being my father's friend and business partner to something so much more. </p> <p>Contains mature themes. </p>";
