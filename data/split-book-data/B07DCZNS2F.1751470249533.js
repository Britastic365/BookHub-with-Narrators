But you think it's true, don't you, Kai Mori? The story about the hidden 12th floor. The mystery of the dark guest who never checked in and never checks out. You think I can help you find that secret hideaway and get to him, don't you? I will never betray him. So sit tight. On Devil's Night, the hunt will be coming to you. </p> <p>Kai: You have no idea what I seek, Little One. You don't know what I had to become to survive three years in prison for a crime I would gladly commit again. I want that hotel, I want to find him, and I want this over. I want my life back. But the more I'm around you, the more I realize this new me is exactly who I was meant to be. So come on, kid. Don't chicken out. My house is on the hill. So many ways in, and good luck finding your way out. I've seen your hideaway. Time to see mine. </p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
