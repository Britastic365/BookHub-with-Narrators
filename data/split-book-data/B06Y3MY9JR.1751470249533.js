Two years since I traded prison bars for streets and hunted a runaway who I'd met in an alley. </p> <p>Two days </p> <p>Since I forgot how to lie, woke to fists, and chased after the girl who'd been stolen from me. </p> <p>Two hours </p> <p>To save her, rescue her, keep my lies intact. She looks at me full of hate. I look at her full of confession. </p> <p>Two minutes </p> <p>For our relationship to switch from mutual dislike to floundering with unknowns. I've hurt her. Now, she's hurt me. I guess we're even. </p> <p>Two seconds </p> <p>For her to listen, to see, to finally know who I am. The answer comes with hardship. The answer isn't what she wants to hear. </p> <p>Two breaths </p> <p>For me to walk out the door. </p> <p>Two heartbeats </p> <p>For it all to be over. </p>";
