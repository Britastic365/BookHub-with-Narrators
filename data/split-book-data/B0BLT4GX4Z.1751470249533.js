window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>An all new full cast duet narrated series in the Mate Games world from <i>USA Today</i> best-selling authors, Meg Anne and K. Loraine. Includes the prequel novella <i>Promised to the Night.</i></p> <p>Roslyn Blackthorne is dead. Technically. I faked my death to get out of a loveless marriage, but that was only half the battle. To ensure my vampire duke can never find me, I have to run far and fast enough so he can’t catch me. Because if he does, it’s over. Not just my life—for real this time—but my entire family’s.</p> <p>So how does the princess of the Blackthorne vampires disappear in a world where every supernatural creature knows who she is? Summon a demon, of course. Pan agrees to keep me hidden, help me start a new life…for a cost. And it’s not my soul he’s after. Oh no, he wants my blood…and my body. But so do they. The shifter twins. The cursed hacker. And, of course, my estranged husband.</p> <p>Starting over should be easy after my bargain with the demon. New name. New job. New reality in a tiny town where no one would think to search. Welcome to Aurora Springs, Alaska, a sleepy place where everyone is hiding something and nothing ever happens. At least it was…until I arrived and people started dropping like flies.</p> <p>It looks like I brought my past, and a whole host of other problems, with me. But that’s not a big deal, right? It’s not the end of the world or anything.</p> <p>WARNING: The Mate Games: Pestilence is a spicy why choose series that is sure to set your…heart…on fire. If you’re not a fan of grumpy dukes with a penchant for pain, purple demons with fancy body parts, nosy hackers with boundary issues, angsty wolf shifters who like to share, sword crossing, and plenty of group activities, this one’s not for you. But if it is…welcome back to The Mate Games, we’ve been waiting for you.</p>";
