window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>If you're looking for Eli's happy ever after, you're in the right place!</b></p> <p>Lyra's life hasn't been all sunshine and roses. She knows what it means to be alone after losing her parents at a young age. Witnessing the devastation her mother experienced after losing her bonded Alphas made one thing clear to Lyra: scent matching isn't for her.</p> <p>No archaic rules or fluke of biology is going to tell her who to love. Not now and not ever. Friendship, compatibility, and hard work are the best ways to find people to spend your life with. But all of it means nothing when her pack meets their scent-matched Omega. Suddenly, Lyra wasn't wanted. Thrown out of their lives and completely alone, Lyra is forced to start over—again.</p> <p>When a job offer in a city where no one knows her name seems too perfect to be true, Lyra jumps on it. Really, who would turn down the chance to be an executive assistant at one of the most powerful companies in the country? Getting away from the pack who broke her heart was just an added bonus.</p> <p>But her first encounter with the person she's been hired to work for doesn't go as planned. Her new boss… is one of her Alpha scent matches. This brings Lyra face to face with the past she's been running from her entire life. The more she lets them in, the more Lyra realizes she might be wrong—about everything.</p> <p>Maybe scent matches aren't just a fluke. Maybe they're the only thing that matters.</p>";
