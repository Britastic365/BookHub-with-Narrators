window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Foolish women fall in love with the bad boy.</p> <p>Cane Alexander was bad boy personified.</p> <p>Confident, he entered a room with his piercing blue eyes wearing a smug grin. He was the proverbial red flag wrapped up in a ridiculous set of abs.</p> <p>I tried to resist him. After all, I was done being a fool.</p> <p>Maybe it was his charm, or perhaps it was his persistence. Maybe it was how he entered my life and refused to leave. Whatever the reason, I fell for the one man I should’ve resisted.</p> <p><i>Even though it made me a target.</i></p> <p>I didn’t know if I’d become yet another notch on his bedpost or be the exception to his rules.</p> <p>Or if I’d survive long enough to be either.</p> <p>From USA Today Bestselling author Adriana Locke comes a tale full of twists and turns. Listeners who enjoy opposites attract, romantic suspense, and cocky heroes will enjoy this story.</p> <p>Note: The Exception now includes an extended epilogue previously titled The Connection.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
