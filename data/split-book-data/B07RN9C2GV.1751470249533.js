window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A werewolf walks into a bar. </p> <p>Tank is working as a bouncer when he notices something odd about the sexy-as-sin bartender. He’s odorless, he’s amazingly popular with shifters, and he’s terrified. </p> <p>A man without a smell. </p> <p>Isaac is trying to escape his past. He hides in San Francisco, because everyone knows that there are no werewolves in the Bay Area. </p> <p>Until one walks into his bar.</p> <p>Can a gentle werewolf with a trampled heart show a man who’s been running scared that sometimes there are monsters worth running towards? </p> <p><i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Gail Carriger (writing as G. L. Carriger) brings you the next in her charming gay werewolves series. The San Andreas Shifter books stand alone and do not need to be listened in any order. But if you're a stickler, this book comes after Bryan and Max's story, <i>The Sumage Solution</i>. </p> <p>Delicate Sensibilities? </p> <p>This audiobook contains m/m sexy times and horrible puns. If you get offended easily, then you probably will. San Andreas Shifter stories include blue language, dirty deeds, and outright admiration for the San Francisco Bay Area. Not for the faint of heart, or mouth, or tongue. <br> </p>";
