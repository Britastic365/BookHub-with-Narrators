window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From #1 </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author Nora Roberts comes a seductive and suspenseful novel of dangerous liaisons and family betrayals....</b></p> <p>Photographer Jo Ellen Hathaway thought she'd escaped the house called Sanctuary long ago. She'd spent her loneliest years there, after the sudden, unexplained disappearance of her mother. Yet the sprawling inn on an island off the Georgia coast continues to haunt her dreams. And now, even more haunting are the pictures someone is sending her: strange close-ups and candids, culminating in the most shocking portrait of all - a photo of her mother - naked, beautiful, and dead.</p> <p>Now Jo must return to the island, and to her bitterly estranged family. With the help of Nathan Delaney - who was on the island the summer her mother disappeared - Jo hopes to learn the truth about the tragic past. But Sanctuary may be the most dangerous place of all.</p>";
