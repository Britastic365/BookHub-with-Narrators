window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Unexpectedly sweet and blazing hot steam, now in one boxed set. Enjoy four full-length stand-alone novels, featuring single dads from </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author Kendall Ryan in one complete volume. </b><br> <br> <b><i>The Dare</i></b><i><br> </i><br> As an ER nurse, I've seen a lot of things, but this might take the cake. Because the charming hottie packing a whole lotta somethin' somethin' beneath his hospital gown? He's all kinds of naughty trouble. And I have time for exactly none of it.<br> <br> I didn't expect to see Cade again—never expected the guy I treated in my ER would turn out to be the sweet, single dad I'm now secretly lusting over. Complicated doesn't even begin to cover it.</p> <p><b><i>Only for Tonight</i></b></p> <p>He’s bossy, moody, and overprotective.</p> <p>He’s also a pro athlete who needs to focus on winning games and staying out of the headlines.</p> <p>I’m fiercely independent and need a man like I need a second period each month.</p> <p>So when our worlds collide, I never expected him to be the one to jump in and save me. Especially not when my roommate disappears, leaving me with her baby.</p> <p>I’m clueless about babies—and it shows. Good thing Alexei isn’t. With six nieces and nephews and an apparent hero complex, the dude is both sexy and more than capable. It’s a combination that makes it easy to forget we’re just playing house.</p> <p><b><i>Penthouse Prince</i></b></p> <p>Lexington Dane was my brother’s best friend growing up. We did everything together. He taught me how to throw a punch, how to change a tire…and he taught me how to kiss. I fell hard and fast, and gave him all my firsts.</p> <p>I promised I’d wait for him.… But I’m done waiting, because he went off to college and never came back. He took his fancy business degree and moved to New York City, where he promptly became a real estate mogul—turning every penthouse and apartment project he touched into gold. It’s been ten years, and now he’s back and needs a favor…someone to watch his little girl. That’s right, the cocky penthouse prince and heartbreaker extraordinaire Lexington is back with an adorable two-year-old daughter.</p> <p>Guess who he wants to watch her? I’ve never been able to say no to him. I might agree to be the nanny for his precious little angel, but there’s no way in hell I’m falling for her hot-as-sin daddy.</p> <p><b><i>The Soul Mate</i></b></p> <p>The smoking-hot one-night stand I was never supposed to see again?<br> <br> Yeah, well, I might be pregnant, and he’s my OB-GYN.</p>";
