window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An alpha wolf, a seductive vampire, and a dominant fae all walk into a bar. What do they have in common?</b></p> <p>Being mated to me, apparently.</p> <p>My dreams of retirement crashed and burned when the rogue shifter bit me. Not only have I changed into something neither world has ever seen before, but my mission just became even more impossible. To find the answers about what I am, I enlist the help of an infamous ex-poltergeist, a shifter freak, and my least favorite pigeon.</p> <p>What a team we make.</p> <p>Oh, and did I forget to mention that my mate’s bloodthirsty daughter is awake and hunting my ass now? Because that’s a thing, too.</p> <p>Why?</p> <p>I have no idea, but we have every intention of finding out.</p> <p>An angel is playing games with me, but little do they know—I’ve got three alphas by my side, and this dark horse plays for keeps.</p> <p><i>White Raven</i> is book two in A Demon's Guide to the Afterlife series. This is an adult paranormal romance series with multiple love interests and some dark elements. If you don't like strong but flawed women and alphahole heroes that need to learn a thing or two about boundaries—this book is not for you. If you love works by Kristen Banet, Ivy Asher, Raven Kennedy, Jaymin Eve, and Kristy Cunning, then dive right in to the Afterlife. It'll be one hell of a ride.</p>";
