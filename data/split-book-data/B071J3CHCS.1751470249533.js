window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Sexy, alluring, ruthless, and oh so complicated. </p> <p>West Moseley is known as the \"charming\" Dark Dweller. With his cheeky grin and southern drawl, he can charm anyone, especially women. And does. </p> <p>But after being held prisoner and tortured by the cruel Seelie Queen, West's past comes back to haunt him. His memories of a tragic event and the truth of what happened on the Light side goes deeper than anyone realizes. Things he wants no one to know about. </p> <p>Struggling with his own demons, he battles the very essence of what he is - a Dark Dweller - a terrifying beast from the Otherworld designed to hunt and kill. </p> <p>When the Unseelie King sends him to Ireland to uncover a dangerous artifact, West's entire world takes a dangerous turn. </p> <p>When a treasure lands in his hands, one he never suspected, nor wanted, he learns one crucial thing: you don't steal from the Demon King...not if you want to live. </p> <p>West is a spin-off of the Darkness Series. It is a standalone adult urban fantasy romance, but it would greatly benefit the listener to start with the Darkness Series (1-4) first. West contains storylines, world building, and spoilers from previous audiobooks and characters. It's highly recommended starting with Darkness of Light (Book One).</p> <p>Sexual content, language, alcohol, violence, death, and other mature content intended for listeners 17 and older. </p>";
