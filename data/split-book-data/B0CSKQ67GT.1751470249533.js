window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Lurking behind his eyes are demons as dark as mine.</i></p> <p><b>Abby</b><br> We were always told as children that monsters are the things that go bump in the night, but they were wrong. Monsters are often the ones that warm your bed, poison dripping from their teeth and claws, embedding in your skin.<br> I hunt them. I end them. Without hesitation.<br> But…then I hesitated. I stumbled straight into the monster’s den, the biggest and baddest of them all. The king of New York.<br> Roman Antonov.<br> I fell in love with him, and his demons.<br> And I hate him for it.<br> <br> <b>Roman</b><br> Who I am?<br> I’m the guy parents warn their children about. The name that strikes fear into the heart of this city and brings it to its knees.<br> I show no mercy. Cross me, and you will die screaming.<br> And the only thing I ever wanted was her. She was always meant to be mine, I knew that from the start. Even if she didn’t.<br> But my life, and my family, are not your typical aristocracy.<br> We’re monsters. Cutthroats. Killers.<br> But then again…so is she.<br> <i>A match made in hell.</i><br> <br> Whilst this is book one in a series, it can be listened to as a <b>standalone</b>.</p>";
