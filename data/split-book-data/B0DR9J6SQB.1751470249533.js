window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the once-quiet town of Willow Creek, my life was a steady beat, a rhythmic routine, until the carnival stormed in, a whirlwind of chaos and danger.</p> <p>Under the neon lights and haunting melodies, Cade's eyes found mineâ€”piercing, intense, sending shivers through my soul. He was a dark storm, a looming shadow over my every move.</p> <p>Cade's obsession was relentless, his desire a madness that knew no bounds. Like a predator, he stalked me, every step a calculated move in his sinister dance. I tried to resist, but his twisted charm was a siren's song, pulling me deeper into his carnival of nightmares.</p> <p>Reality blurred into illusion, and I found myself ensnared in a sinister game, where every shadow whispered secrets and every smile hid a threat. In Willow Creek's heart, where nightmares walked freely and darkness reigned, I faced a chilling truth: in a stalker's eyes, love and obsession are one.</p> <p>As the carnival lights dim and darkness falls, I stand at a crossroads. Will I succumb to Cade's dangerous embrace, or will I fight to break free from his deadly grip?</p> <p>Carnival Nightmare is a dark stalker novella with heavy subjects that some listeners may find triggering. There will be access to a full list of the warnings at the beginning of the book. This story has no cliffhanger and ends with a HEA.</p>";
