window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The man smiled at Timmy. \"That would be nice of you. Why don't you lead the way?\" Timmy moved past the man and started back up the hill. He heard the whoosh of something moving quickly through the air, but it hit him before he had time to react. He felt the impact against his head and his whole body flew sideways through the air. Landing in the dense ground cover, his face was momentarily buried in loose dirt, pine needles, dried leaves and twigs. Lifting his head, he took a deep breath and started to scramble away on his hands and knees. A strong hand caught him by the neck and pushed him back into the dirt. \"Sorry, Timmy, I can't let you go now,\" the man whispered. \"You'd tell.\" Timmy Beck, Fireman Mike Richards' boyhood friend, was killed twenty years ago, but everyone in the town is sure they caught the right man - or did they? Why is Timmy's ghost still haunting Lake Le-Aqua-Na? Mary, Bradley, Ian and Mike investigate and find the true murderer may be much closer than they had ever expected.</p>";
