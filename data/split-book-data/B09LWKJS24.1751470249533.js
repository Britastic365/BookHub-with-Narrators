window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>You're going to pay....</b></p> <p>The pressures of fame and an obsessive stalker have driven pop star Olivia Smith to take shelter at Halcyon Hall, an exclusive spa on a remote island off the coast of Maine. Yet from the moment she arrives, there are rumors about women disappearing and stories about the resort’s grisly past. Then a note arrives from her stalker, proving that nowhere is truly safe.... </p> <p>It’s been 25 years since Sheriff Deacon Howell discovered his first dead body on these grounds. Back then, Halcyon Hall was an asylum known as Bainesworth Manor. Others have perished here since, including Deacon’s wife. Many locals share his belief that her death wasn’t suicide. The difference is, they think Deacon killed her. But he has bigger problems than gossip, because another body has been found.... </p> <p>As Deacon investigates the increasing threats to the singer’s life, the danger becomes undeniable. Something evil lurks here - not just in the asylum’s grim history, but in the present. And there will be no rest at Halcyon Hall until every sin has been avenged....</p>";
