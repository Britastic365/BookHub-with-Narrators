window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Welcome to the Afterlife, where the population is always growing and the locals lack a sense of humor.</b></p> <p>Don't get me wrong, waking up to discover my ex-husband finally killed me wasn't fun. Finding out I had to get a job and pay Afterlife taxes about 10 minutes later? Let's just say, this wasn't exactly the eternal reward I was hoping for. But beggars can't be choosers, and being a demon sure as hell beats my last occupation.</p> <p>I’m well on my way to retirement behind the pearly gates when the impossible happens. The Risk Witches have a vision.<br> <br> A savage shifter that can't control his wolf. An ancient fae lord that's forgotten what it means to feel. A playboy vampire king with a secret.</p> <p>Three alphas will inherit unspeakable power. Each of them scarred. Too broken to be tamed....</p> <p>Upper Management sent their best to \"fix\" them. Angels. Poltergeists. Nothing worked.</p> <p>So now it's my turn, whether I like it or not. But unfortunately for me, failure is not an option with these guys.</p> <p>Combined, they have enough power to end the world—and they will. Unless I find a way to stop them first.</p> <p>Breaking people is my job. But this time...my job might break me.</p> <p>Author's note: This is a completed adult paranormal romance series with multiple love interests and some dark elements. If you don't like strong but flawed women and alphahole heroes that need to learn a thing or two about boundaries—this book is not for you. If you love works by Eva Chase, Caroline Peckham, Raven Kennedy, Nikki St.Crowe, and Kristy Cunning, then dive right in to the Afterlife. It'll be one hell of a ride.</p>";
