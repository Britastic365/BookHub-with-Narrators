window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I'm Muse Harper. I'm a twenty-something painter who loves red wine, quirky movies, and men with fatal flaws. But that was before I met Jasper King. He became my fatal flaw. Eight months ago I had a choice to make - abandon everything I've ever known to protect my family or stay and risk someone getting hurt. I chose the former. My plan was working just fine until I found out my father had gone missing. That was when I met Jasper. A bounty hunter with the eyes of a tiger and the nose of a bloodhound, he was supposed to help me find my father. What I didn't know was that meeting him was no accident. Hunting people isn't all that Jasper does. And helping me was only part of his plan. I just wish I'd found out sooner, before my heart got involved. But even then, I don't know if I'd have done things differently.Now I have another choice to make - trust the man I'm falling in love with and hope he'll do the right thing or run as far away from him as I can get. </p>";
