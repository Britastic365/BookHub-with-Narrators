She’s never felt so cared for and cherished, but she still hasn’t gotten over the fear that came with getting swept into the guys’ last job. </p> <p>When Elliot, Rhett, and Oliver have to leave town for a few days, Wren opts to stay home, too worried she’ll end up in danger if she goes with them. The guys take precautions to keep her safe, but they miscalculate just how desperate some of their enemies are for payback. Alone, Wren gets kidnapped by a man who only cares about one thing: avenging his brother’s death. Meanwhile Elliot, Rhett, and Oliver are halfway across the country when they finally realize what’s going on. </p> <p>While Wren fights to stay alive, the guys rush to get back.
