An egotistical, smarmy, father-stealing bastard, and she would never forgive him for what he had done to her and her family - such as it was. </p> <p>Stevie Coolidge's hatred of Trent Lazenby was the white-hot anger of a daughter scorned. He had lured her father - who meant even more to her since she had lost her mother - away from her, by being all accomplished and perfect and gorgeous. </p> <p>Well, anyway. He was probably a fraud or a crook or a gigolo. </p> <p>For Trent, there was only one woman in the world for him - the one who hated him the most, his mentor's daughter, Stevie. Spoiled, self-centered brat that she was, only she would do for him. Good thing he enjoyed a challenge, and taming her to his hand was going to be a big one. </p>";
