window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.</p> <p>That’s how it begins. Or how it began again.</p> <p>It’s been six years since my last confession. Once, I was an innocent. My life was a rose-colored dream with four best friends by my side: Eternity, Heath, Angel, and Saint—my big brother and my hero. When Eternity was murdered, everything changed. My family put me in hiding to protect me. But no one can hide forever.</p> <p>Now I’m back, attending a tiny Catholic college and attempting to move on with my life with the help of the sinfully tempting priest, Father Salvatore. I never expected to find Heath, Angel, and Saint roaming the halls of Thorncrown University, thirsting for vengeance.</p> <p>I never expected them to hear my confession. I never expected them to blackmail me with it.</p> <p>They say they’ve paid for their sins.</p> <p>Now it’s my turn. I must do my penance. On my knees. At their altar.</p> <p>If I don’t, the whole world will know my sins.</p> <p>If I do… I might just find out the truth behind Eternity’s murder.</p>";
