Burnt out and discouraged, he hunches over a meal in a backwater diner, when a half-frozen woman with the look of an abused runaway staggers through the door. His first instinct is to help her, make certain she stays long enough for the bluish cast to leave her lips. His second is to finish his meal and leave. The world is full of broken women. It's not his job to fix them. </p> <p><i>Honor Bound</i> </p> <p>Honor wants Milton with every bone in her body, but it's a terrible idea, especially after she delves into his head and sees his ambivalence toward her kind. Need drives them together, but their differences create roadblocks every step of the way. Fueled by anger and fear, she shuts him out. So what if the sex was great, she's done. </p> <p>Or is she? </p> <p><i>Claiming Charity</i> </p> <p>Charity's luck never ran strong, because her original configuration was unstable. Her handlers designed experiments to fix the problem, but only made it worse. Sick to death of living under their thumb, she jumps at a chance to escape. She's barely settled in as a CIA special operative - a role where she can put her augmented mind and body to use - when her wobbly genetics decompensate. </p> <p><i>Loving Hope</i> </p> <p>Charlie swore off women after his last marriage that went down in drama-tipped flames fifteen years ago. His first mistress is danger. He fell in love with the adrenaline rush when he signed on as a Navy Seal, right out of college, and he never got over the thrill of pitting himself against the impossible. </p> <p><i>Keeping Faith</i> </p> <p>Reginald Thomas agreed to run the CIA's infirmary after a bullet nailed him in Afghanistan. He's one of a handful of scientists who produced the original batches of genetically modified humans, and he's laid low since their rebellion. The catastrophe rankles, but he hasn't given up finding a fix for their genome problems. </p>";
