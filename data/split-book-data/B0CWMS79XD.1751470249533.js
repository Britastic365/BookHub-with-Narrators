Even if it meant removing myself from her life to save her the heartache that comes from being with a Made Man.</p> <p>But when she needed me, I couldn't resist her call. I would always be there for her. Even if it meant seeing her in the hands of another man. At least that’s what I told myself. Saoirse was walking temptation, and I didn’t believe I could resist.</p> <p>Jameson Scott Burne. </p> <p>Best friend, confidant, protector. </p> <p>I’d always loved him, but he left me, destroying everything before we even had a chance. He was my everything until he wasn’t. He swore we could be nothing, until I called his bluff. <br> <br> But when the bratva prince wanted to force me into marriage to cement his hold over Boston, Scotty came back. He claimed me—tried to make up for the past. <br> <br> Could I trust him to keep me safe? Could the man who left me be trusted with my life, now that I was engaged to someone else?<br> <br> ***His Ruthless Queen is a stand-alone in an interconnected series.
