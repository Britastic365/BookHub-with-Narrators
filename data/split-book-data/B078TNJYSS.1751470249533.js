Two of her cases may be connected, but how? </p> <p>There's no short list of suspects to investigate, but the closer Lexi gets to the killer, the more her life is put in jeopardy. Trying to avoid being framed for a murder she didn't commit, Lexi knows her luck is running out. </p> <p>To make matters worse, her boyfriend, sexy detective Adam Maddox, thinks she's out of the PI game faster than she got into it. Her boss, the mysterious Solomon, meanwhile, hopes to get her between the sheets by night, as well as solving cases by day, and Lexi's \"just say no\" resolve might not be as fortified as she believes. </p> <p>All she wants is to be taken seriously and there's only one way she can do that - solve the cases, no matter what. </p>";
