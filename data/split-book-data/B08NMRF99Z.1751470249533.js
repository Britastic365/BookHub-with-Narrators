Stripping naked and letting your boyfriend’s best friend paint your body in order to sell custom motorcycles isn’t the ideal way to start a brand-new relationship.</p> <p>Add in a TV reality show, another best friend who seems determined to make me notice him, and the little fact that in order to get paid I will have to strut my stuff in public wearing nothing but body paint.</p> <p>Yeah. There’s not a chance in hell that Ronin is going to be okay with all this.</p> <p><b>Ronin</b></p> <p>It feels like everyone is trying to break us apart.
