window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Welcome to Nocturne Falls, the town that celebrates Halloween 365 days a year. The tourists think it's all a show: the vampires, the werewolves, the witches, the occasional gargoyle flying through the sky. But the supernaturals populating the town know better. </b></p> <p><b>Living in Nocturne Falls means being yourself. Fangs, fur, and all. </b></p> <p>Half-reaper, half-vampire Kora Dupree has made big changes in her life. She’s on good terms with her previously estranged father and taken on all kinds of adult responsibilities. But when an opportunity to find out the truth about her late mother comes along, she can’t resist pursuing it. Even when it means returning to her somewhat dubious ways. </p> <p>Vampire Greyson Garrett knows the bad but beautiful Kora is up to something. He’s wise to her games. After all, her father has hired Greyson numerous times to save Kora from all the sticky situations she’s gotten herself into. If she were just…better-behaved he could see himself falling for her. Hard. </p> <p>Even though Kora promises she’s changed, Greyson has his doubts. So much so that he follows her one fateful night and gets pulled into her latest scheme. It’s not like he hasn’t been here before, but this time he swears it’s her last chance to prove she’s different. </p> <p>Kora’s new adventure sends them on a treasure hunt that takes them all over the globe, and in the course of their travels, they realize how good things are when they work together. But will that all change when the adventure is over? Are they really in love? Or just addicted to the rush?</p>";
