Their feelings for me were matched only by their hatred for each other.</p> <p>Gaeton, with his brash charm and casual cruelty. </p> <p>Beast, his lust equal to his penchant for violence.</p> <p>Being with them was sinful and perfect in different ways. In the end, I couldn’t choose, and I lost them both. </p> <p>Now, my sisters have tasked me with securing our power base, no matter the cost. I will do anything for my family - even if it means agreeing to the terms set by Gaeton and Beast. </p> <p>The three of us. Together. But only for as long as it takes me to choose one of them once and for all. </p> <p>When playing games of power, happily ever after isn’t a priority. Not even for me. </p> <p>Especially not for me.</p>";
