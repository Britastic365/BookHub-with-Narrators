window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>I never would have seen him coming, not in a million years. Feral. Growling. Terrifying. Until my wolf claimed him as hers.</b></p> <p><b>Shay</b></p> <p>I'm a lot of things; a loyal best friend, music lover, introvert. All labels I'd happily claim are mine. Survivor of abuse, I'll claim because it's true, and I'm a survivor. But fated mate? That one feels like an ill-fitting glove. Especially when said mate has been feral for years, and nobody knows what sent him over the edge, let alone how to get him back.</p> <p>But there's no denying my wolf, and she wants him. So what's a girl to do? Bathe the stinky wolf if he's going to sneak into my bed and then play him Mozart until dawn. Obviously. But a fated mate connection is a once-in-a-lifetime bond. And if he can't turn back into a man... will I be alone forever, even with him at my side?</p> <p><b>Dirge</b></p> <p>I've been on the run for so many years, I don't remember how to be a man, not really. But Shay calls to that part of me, the part I hid away so long ago. She's everything a man could want. Gorgeous, intelligent, and funny, all wrapped into a stunning, shyly sweet package.</p> <p>There's nothing under the moon I want more than to hold her in my arms. That's the problem, though; if I give into the urge, and if I change back and take her as mine... I sign her death warrant. The fates have foretold it, and the only way I can save her is to never go back, no matter how badly it hurts. To save her, I have to stay a wolf.</p>";
