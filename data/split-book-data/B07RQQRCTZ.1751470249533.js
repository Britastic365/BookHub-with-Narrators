window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>He was dark. So dark, she couldn’t keep her gaze from him....</p> <p>When Paige Reed spots a man across the room at a party, she’s fascinated and decides she wants him in her bed. Fortunately, her husband, Connor, doesn’t mind. He’s attracted to the powerful man too.</p> <p>Always bi-curious, the right opportunity has never presented itself to Connor Morgan. Until now. He doesn’t mind bringing another man into their marriage as long as it doesn’t drive a wedge between him and Paige.</p> <p>Former NFL player, Graedon Ward likes to be in control. He’s more than pleased with Paige's obvious interest. However, she makes it quite clear: it's a package deal. If he wants her, he has to take on her husband too, and past experience has taught him that’s a dangerous road to travel.</p> <p>The chemistry between the three is explosive, but it’s Grae’s desire to share the same level of intimacy he sees between Paige and Conner that puts real pressure on the threesome. And it may cause it all to crash and burn.</p> <p><b>Note: This book in the series can be listened to as stand-alone. It includes an HEA ending. It is intended for audiences over 18 years of age since it includes light BDSM as well as explicit sexual scenes between all three characters.</b></p>";
