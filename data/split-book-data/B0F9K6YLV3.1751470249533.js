window.bookSummaryJSON = "Life got you down? Like literally on the ground and kicking you? Welcome to the club, my club that is. Savanna Everyone wanted something from me, and he was no different, but he wanted to make my nightmares and his fantasies my new reality. It didn’t matter if I was bought, sold, or given as a gift. I had no say in my future, or so they thought. I did the unthinkable, I killed my guard and disappeared into the night. I knew one person who could help me, save me, and keep me from the hell that awaited me. Ronnie, as she likes to be called now. My first act of rebellion, as I hit the road, was to change my blonde locks, his favorite feature, into pink strands of perfection. Throwing away the long dresses for tight jeans and a leather jacket. I robbed my father of a few thousand dollars.

When her past came crashing into our club, she wanted to sacrifice herself. Oh, there would be a sacrifice, I will even bring her the bloody corpse as a gift. Hell had a few vacancies, and I was about to fill them. Who knew the way to a woman’s heart was blood, death, and gore?";
