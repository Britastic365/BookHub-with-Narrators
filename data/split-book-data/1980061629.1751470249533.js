window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Duty - or desire? </p> <p>Vampire soldier Adare O'Cearbhaill's default setting is cranky. Or irritated. Or downright hostile. </p> <p>Still, as a Highlander of honor and duty, he stepped up to save an enhanced and special human female by mating her - with merely a bite and a brand. The last person he wants in his life is a fragile human, yet he can't get her out of his mind as she regains her strength before taking off for parts unknown. And when he discovers she is in danger, nothing can stop him from hunting her down - whether she likes it or not. </p> <p>There's only one way to find out.... </p> <p>Photographer Grace Cooper has had it with vampires, demons, and the rest of an immortal world she was happier not knowing about. She also doesn't believe she's destined for some great battle because of an old birthmark. Forget the fact that her mate is the sexiest thing on two stubborn feet or that her brand is fading along with her health. She'll handle things on her own - until an old enemy reappears and she learns the only way to stay alive is to actually mate, wild sex and all, with that ripped and dangerous Adare - a powerful, captivating Highlander who demands nothing less than everything....</p>";
