window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A spellbinding story of three princesses and the destiny they were born for: seduction, conquest, and the crown. Immerse yourself in the first book in a new fantasy trilogy from the author of the </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling Ash Princess series.</b></p> <p><b>\"[A] page-turner that brilliantly blends magic, romance, and adventure.”—</b><b><i>Booklist</i></b></p> <p>Empress Margaraux has had plans for her daughters since the day they were born. Princesses Sophronia, Daphne, and Beatriz will be queens. And now, age sixteen, they each must leave their homeland and marry their princes.</p> <p>Beautiful, smart, and demure, the triplets appear to be the perfect brides—because Margaraux knows there is one common truth: everyone underestimates a girl. Which is a grave mistake. Sophronia, Daphne, and Beatriz are no innocents. They have been trained since birth in the arts of deception, seduction, and violence with a singular goal—to bring down monarchies—and their marriages are merely the first stage of their mother’s grand vision: to one day reign over the entire continent of Vesteria.</p> <p>The princesses have spent their lives preparing, and now they are ready, each with her own secret skill, and each with a single wish, pulled from the stars. Only, the stars have their own plans—and their mother hasn’t told them all of hers.</p> <p>Life abroad is a test. Will their loyalties stay true? Or will they learn that they can’t trust anyone—not even each other?</p>";
