But that version of me is dead. My father and the other Archangels have no idea who, or what, I have become in my time away, and if they want to drag me back screaming, they have another thing coming.</p> <p>When scouts find the Rebellion camp and blood stains the ground of our new home, we are left with no choice but to create a plan.</p> <p>A plan to extinguish Alfemir and all they stand for.</p> <p>Buried secrets come to light that have the opportunity to change the tides in our favor, but at what cost?</p> <p>New enemies and friends reveal themselves, and I'm left reeling between all the connections around me and figuring out what each of them means.</p> <p>Is it possible to fall for more than one soul that calls out to me when it feels like I have a home in each of theirs? More so, is it possible to not have to choose between them?</p> <p>Fighting for those I've come to love and the possibility of a better future for all fills me with a purpose I've never felt before.</p> <p>I just never thought my purpose would impact whether we all live or die in the end.</p> <p>Stars, give me strength.</p> <p>Wings of Pain <i>is book two in the Fallen Destiny trilogy. Follow Kieran and her jealous, possessive mates as they unravel the secrets buried in the stars. Book two will end in a cliffhanger. For mature listeners.</i></p>";
