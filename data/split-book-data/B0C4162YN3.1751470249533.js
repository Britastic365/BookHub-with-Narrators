window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>He's my brother's ex-best friend ... and the guy who left my heart in pieces.</b></p> <p>Ryder Huntington was my first and only broken heart. I promised no one would tear me up like his sweet words and broken promises ever again.</p> <p>I didn't expect the first time I landed a high-paying interior design job for an MLB player would be the day we met again. And I certainly didn't expect Ryder would bring with him cops, handcuffs, and words like \"breaking and entering.\"</p> <p>Now he wants to make up for the misunderstanding. Well, that ship has sailed, I think.</p> <p>I should detest Ryder out of sheer loyalty to my brother and my heart, but the longer we’re together, the harder he is to hate. Under that steely exterior, he hides pain he doesn't let anyone see. Part of me wants to heal his broken pieces … but falling for him again just might break me in the process.</p> <p><i>Perfect for those who love a good mix of sweet and sizzle, toe-curling kisses, swoony baseball book boyfriends, and a happily ever after in a standalone romance.</i></p>";
