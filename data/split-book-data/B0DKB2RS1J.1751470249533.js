window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The first time Dimitri Castallanos experienced obsession, he committed a felony. He was five. Dimitri is a psychopath. And he’s still obsessed with just one person.</p> <p>Arlo Miller was born a victim, raised as his father’s punching bag and his mother’s scapegoat. Dimitri was his only protection, and they took him away.</p> <p>As children, they clung to each other. As adults, they pretend neither remembers, while both harbor secret crushes on the other. Dimitri hides his feelings behind a mask of indifference. Arlo hides his by falling for very bad men.</p> <p>When one of those men confronts Dimitri, this time it's Arlo who commits a felony. Murder. But Dimitri won’t allow Arlo to take the fall. With the help of Dimitri’s mother and seven psychopaths, they now have twenty-four hours to fake an alibi, hide a body, and confess their true feelings for each other, once and for all.</p> <p>Which is harder? Falling in love or getting away with murder?</p>";
