window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>Three feel-good, panty-melting, LOL small town romances in one collection for the first time! </i></b><br> <br> <b>BOSS WITHOUT BENEFITS</b><br> <br> <b>Last night, I met the funniest, sexiest single dad on the planet.</b><br> <br> I also managed to get into the kind of co-ed naked trouble with him that involved a nurse, a shotgun, a feral turkey, and a pair of pliers. But all's well that ends well, and we already have plans to meet up again. It's early days, but I'm already thinking Drew might be The One.<br> <br> <b>Then I show up to my new nanny gig and who steps out on the front porch, holding the cutest little redhead in the world? </b>Yep, that's right. Drew is <i>Andrew McGuire</i>, my new boss, and he's not about to date the nanny. Or is he…?<br> <br> <b>NOT TODAY BOSSMAN</b><br> <br> Barrett McGuire is the grumpiest, growliest, most frustrating man on the planet.<br> <b>He’s also my boss, my one and only one-night-stand, and a man I can't fall for, no matter how hot the chemistry is between us. </b>We're just too different.<br> <br> But then Barrett tells me he wants to change, to be what I need, and proves it with the most romantic “just one bed” weekend ever.<br> <br> <b>But can we make it work in the real world?</b><br> <br> <b>BOSS ME AROUND</b></p> <p><b>Christian McGuire is the last person I should be asking to boss me around in bed</b>. Sure, he's a bonafide Sex God, but he's also my co-worker AND my shiny new brother-in-law.</p> <p>But after a few too many tequila shots one night, I shoot him a text, asking him to be my smut mentor.</p> <p>After insisting on a few ground rules, he agrees. (Boy, does he.) But the more time I spend in the sack with this wild, funny, secretly tender man, the more I fear I'll break the biggest rule of all--Never Fall for Mr. Off Limits.</p>";
