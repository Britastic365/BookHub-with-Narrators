But now his restless mind has turned to a new obsession: cloning a mammoth. </p> <p>In a barren province of Canada, a mammoth hunter financed by Christian has made the discovery of a lifetime: an intact frozen woolly mammoth. But what he finds during the painstaking process of excavating the huge creature baffles the mind. Huddled next to the mammoth is the mummified body of a Stone Age man around 12,000 years old. And he is wearing a wristwatch. </p> <p>It looks like Howard Christian is going to get his wish - and more.</p>";
