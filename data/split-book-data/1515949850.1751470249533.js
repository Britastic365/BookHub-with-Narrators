So it comes as a pleasant surprise when she sits next to a handsome young man who is actually interested in having a conversation about science.</p> <p>Desmond Harrison cannot believe his good fortune when he sits next to Thisbe - she's intelligent and incredibly beautiful. He longs to see her again - but he's ashamed of his low birth. Not to mention his employment with the infamous Professor Gordon, a formerly respected scientist who turned to spiritualism and is now deeply scorned.</p> <p>When Professor Gordon demands that Desmond recover an artifact for him-an ancient object reputed to have terrible power, known as the Eye of Annie Blue - Desmond realizes that only Thisbe holds the key. Desmond must choose between his love for Thisbe and his loyalty to his mentor...but humanity's very future will depend on his choice.</p> <p><b>Contains mature themes.</b></p>";
