window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Meet the Devil of Blackthorne Manor.</b></p> <p>When I was a little girl, I dreamed a handsome knight would come and rescue me from my wretched mother. He'd ride up on his white steed and break the curse I've been fated to carry since the day I was born.</p> <p>Funny how things changed over time, how the fairytale twisted into something far more crooked—and darker—than I ever imagined.</p> <p>In reality, my knight is scarred and broken, living alone in a castle of bones that overlooks the sea. He isn’t searching for me. He never was.</p> <p>Lucian Blackthorne is as cursed as I am, and equally shunned by the locals, the fishers of men, who believe him to be the devil in the flesh.</p> <p>Perhaps he is, with the way his amber eyes draw me in, ignite me like an infernal blaze. And the sins he whispers in my ear are as wickedly intoxicating as the man himself.</p> <p>Yet, his touch is heaven and his will is my weakness.</p> <p>He calls us forbidden, an unsalvageable tragedy, with no happy end. Maybe we are. But in this story, he’s the one who needs saving.</p> <p><i>Master of Salt &amp; Bones</i> is a dark, modern gothic contemporary standalone romance.</p>";
