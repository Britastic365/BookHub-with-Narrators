window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>They tell me to abandon all hope. They tell me the path to freedom is impossible. But I will never bow to defeat.</p> <p>The darkest times can always get darker. With Satan inhabiting a new body and allied with the Queen of the Dead, it seems all the light in the world is gone. I'm nothing but a bird trapped in a cage, prisoner to the madness of Queen Ereshkigal.</p> <p>But things aren't always what they seem.</p> <p>My men will risk death to come for me, and the past linking us all together is coming full circle.</p> <p>Destiny brought me to the underworld for a reason. It's time to take a leap of faith and become what I was meant to be.</p> <p>Not a caged bird, not an angel, and certainly no saint - but the hell-bent incarnation of eternal love and war. And all will fall before me.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
