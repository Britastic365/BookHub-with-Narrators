window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Since Peaches woke up in a fantasy world full of monsters and fae, she’s been treated like a piece of tasty human meat. After six years as a blood slave to vampires and the evil Unseelie queen—beholden to all, and master of none—there’s nothing left but a broken shell with a fractured soul. Until a deadly warrior turns up unannounced in her room.</p> <p>Vampire Haze is the muscle of the Fae Guardians elite cadre of 12. He is a spy, a protector of the weak, hammer and sword, a rigid enforcer of rules. He allows no one close to his heart, lest they see the shame driving him. But when he stumbles across a beguiling woman with sad, desolate eyes, he knows he must help her. She calls to him in more ways than one, igniting a passion neither of them can deny, despite the risks.</p> <p>The Unseelie queen has other treacherous plans for Haze and Peaches. From a twisted masquerade ball, to a labyrinth filled with goblins, to a hidden prison deep underground, they must work together to survive. The only way out is to trust each other....</p> <p>Easier said than done when all he wants to do is feast on her blood.</p> <p><i>A Labyrinth of Fangs and Thorns</i> is book five in the Fae Guardians series, book two in the Season of the Vampire.</p>";
