He stays in the shadows and moves with chains wrapped around him, but his golden eyes watch. To my right, there’s a girl with purple wings and familiar gray eyes.</p> <p>She says she’s my sister, and not just that, but apparently I’m half demon, half angel, and to make it out of here, I have to embrace the new wings on my back and the scythe in my hand.</p> <p>Now I have to choose to either submit to my captor or fight.</p> <p>I’m about to learn that sometimes you have to become a monster to beat the monster.</p>";
