window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Blood slave to courtier of the Winter fae... you'd think I'd moved up. I'm not so sure.</b></p> <p>The auction block awaits, and a vicious vampire prince wants me and what flows through my veins. So I make a run for it, only to end up falling at the feet of a fae warden.</p> <p>Technically, Roar, the Warden of the West, should return me to the vampire court, but he has other ideas. He needs a fake fianc√©e.</p> <p>The deal: if I play his dutiful partner at the Winter Court and help him trick the cold King of Winter, Roar will hide me from the blood-suckers intent on draining the life from me.</p> <p>I agree, and for a while, it seems like nothing can go wrong. That is until Vale, Warden Roar's nemesis, sets his sights on me. A part of me likes the warrior prince's attention. Luckily, the more sane part knows Prince Vale is not a fae to mess with.</p> <p>Besides, I can't dissolve my contract with Warden Roar. To do so would bring down the ire of the king and ruin my chances of earning my freedom. So I do my best to keep Roar and Vale from each other's throats, all the while convincing the Winter Court of my love for Roar.</p> <p>It's official: I'm a part of the deadly game of noble houses, and losing could cost me everything.</p> <p><i>If you like the political intrigue of Game of Thrones and the found family aspect and romances of ACOTAR, you'll love this romantic fantasy.</i></p>";
