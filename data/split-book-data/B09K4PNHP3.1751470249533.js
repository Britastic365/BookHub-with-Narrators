window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Young. Wealthy. Elite. Ruthless. The boys of Clermont Bay ruled over this town as if it was their kingdom.</b></p> <p>Beck Clermont controlled them all. He was arrogant and conceited, and from the moment I met him, he had made up his mind about me. Dangerously handsome and wickedly cruel, he had no intention of letting me spend my senior year under the radar.</p> <p>The secrets of old money ran deep, and even though I barely knew them, the sins of my family had put a target on my back. He was a hurricane, and I was unprepared for the storm. His touch fatal. His impact irreparable.</p> <p>There was no negotiation. He stole my heart. Without warning, without permission. He was the enemy, but that didnâ€™t stop me from falling for <i>the touch of a villain.</i></p>";
