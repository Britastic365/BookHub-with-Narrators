Only with no memory of me. Or us.</p> <p>As Beta of the Aspen Pack, I was forced to watch our former Alpha turn to dark magic and destroy the bonds of our people.</p> <p>I nearly died trying to save us, but I broke the biggest taboo: I told the others that cat shifters existed and almost lost everything in return.</p> <p>Now we have a new Alpha, a new future, and a dangerous and mysterious enemy threatening our stable balance. And a new Tracker.</p> <p>The man who looks like my dead mate.</p> <p>Hunted in Darkness (Aspen Pack Book 2)</p> <p>I knew I wanted her the first time I saw her. Only problem? She can’t be my mate.</p> <p>I’m a son of a traitor and former Alpha and I know it’s the legacy people see.</p> <p>But I must be the Alpha of my Pack and protect them from the new threat to our world: Vampires.</p> <p>Valac and the others are still in the shadows, and we must find their lairs before we lose more than we already have.</p> <p>Only every time the enemy attacks, Skye puts herself in jeopardy. I’m the dominant wolf, but she’s the one with the most to lose.</p> <p>She’s the Pack princess. The daughter of legends.</p> <p>And I know she’s not my mate.</p> <p>But I want her. I need her. And now I must convince my wolf. Or break the most sacred rules of the moon goddess.</p> <p>Again.</p>";
