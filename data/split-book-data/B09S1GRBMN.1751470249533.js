window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Welcome to Traitor’s Den. I hope you like it here, because there’s no leaving the small Western town that’s more theme park than authentic. Once you walk through the portal, you’re stuck as a boot heel in a half foot of mud.</b></p> <p>I’ve never seen the outside world and I don’t care. The cannon-toting, trigger-happy residents here are like family, even if most of them are a few spoons short of a full set. Eventually, everyone grows on you, kinda like nail fungus. But the booze flows freely, and Tiger keeps me company. He’s as much a prisoner as I am.</p> <p>I don’t figure there’s much point in wanting what you can never have. I’ll eventually accept one of my boyfriend’s marriage proposals and then keep policing the one-way town while I pop out the babies he wants. I was born knowing how to make chicken salad out of chicken shit.</p> <p>At least I won’t be bored. Denners aren’t fans of following the rules, and the longer they’re in town, the worse they behave, thanks to the spell that keeps us all trapped here.</p> <p>Just when I think I’ve made my peace with my lot, the portal pops open and two men shoot through, throwing punches before their feet even finish landing in my town. When they finally look at me, all I see is problems. Big, ginormous, entirely-too-handsome problems. And that’s before I even take into account the little “surprise” they brought through with them.</p> <p>No one’s ever looked at me the way they do.</p> <p>They aren’t the kind of men who back down after claiming something.</p> <p>Or someone...</p> <p>Did I say I had my life in Traitor’s Den all figured out? Hell, I couldn’t have been more wrong.</p> <p><b>A sexy fantasy western with growly shifters, sketchy vamps, peculiar mages and creatures, and one badass cowgirl sheriff. Within this small town, magic and gossip flow as freely as whiskey, and work and pleasure are nearly the same thing. Weird things happen on the regular in Traitor's Den. Come and join the quirky family, where everyone's packing. Oh, and don't mind the tiger.</b></p>";
