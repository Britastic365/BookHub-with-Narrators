window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>I'm trying to be a good girl.</b></p> <p>Every day, I lie and pretend I'm not a threat. I swallow insults and avoid the electric fence, crossing my fingers I can fake my way to freedom before I snap and end up permanently caged.</p> <p>Borrowing my sister's identity is my last chance at escape. But Serafina Redfang isn't just a cartel heiress. She's the reason I can never mate the pack of my childhood dreams. Su Jin, Bishop, Dutch, and Reese already belong to her.</p> <p>Now, I have to pretend to be theirs. To smile, hide my scars, and let them close before I let them go forever.</p> <p>I'm not really Redfang royalty. I might not even be a real omega. But if the guys keep bulldozing my lies, you're about to meet the real me.</p> <p>I'm Marisol Redfang, and I'm done hiding my claws.</p> <p>Redfang Royal <i>is a why-choose omegaverse that includes profanity, consensual spice (with MM pairings), and a mix of darker themes and humor. It is technically a standalone novel, but you'll have more fun if you've already listened to the Pack Darling novels. For mature listeners.</i></p>";
