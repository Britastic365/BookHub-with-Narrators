window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Held captive by the evil, illegitimate King of Aradia, Áine is forced to conceal her true magick or face certain death.</p> <p>King Lucius shouldn't have allowed her to live. But blinded by paranoia and arrogance, he has big plans for Áine and her coveted, ineffable power. With her life hanging in the balance, Áine finds herself making hard and fast decisions about who to trust—especially when it comes to her former trainer and fierce protector Daelon. With Daelon back at Lucius's side as the Commander of the Guard, Áine struggles to see beyond his betrayal and to embrace the destiny they both share.</p> <p>Lucius's castle is a tapestry of pleasure, power, and darkness. Underneath the façade of decadence and beauty lies a dark history obscured by magickal binds, and Áine's mission is to expose the truth before she, too, succumbs to Lucius's dominance.</p> <p>While working in the shadows to find allies, Áine falls deeper under the spell of life inside the golden, ethereal castle walls-and all the elites that call them home. And as she gets closer to understanding her purpose, she fears she isn't the only one plotting in secret.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
