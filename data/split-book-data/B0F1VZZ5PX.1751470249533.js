window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The Reign Deer Games are held every three hundred years to replace Santa's sleigh drivers. This is followed by The Great Rut, where reindeer shifters hope to find their one true mateâ€”or mates.</p> <p>Olive wants none of either. She has no desire to try out for a position pulling Santa's sleigh. And she doesn't even want to think about the possibility of having mates.</p> <p>Because of her clumsiness and a harassing family member, she finds shifters who want her as their mate.</p> <p>Can Olive make it through the festivities while avoiding potential mates and not causing a disaster?</p> <p>No. No, she cannot. Olive is bright, but she is clumsy.</p> <p>This is a 'why choose' novella with MFMM (no MM). It is medium spice and steam.</p>";
