The real work's already been done. You ought to make yourself useful and find the man who put the sword in the stone in the first place.'</i><br> <br> The <b>City Watch </b>needs MEN! But what it's <i>got</i> includes <b>Corporal Carrot </b>(technically a dwarf), <b>Lance-constable Cuddy</b> (really a dwarf), <b>Lance-constable Detritus</b> (a troll), <b>Lance-constable Angua </b>(a woman... most of the time) and <b>Corporal Nobbs</b> (disqualified from the human race for shoving).<br> <br> And they need all the help they can get, because someone in <b>Ankh-Morpork</b> has been getting dangerous ideas - about crowns and legendary swords, and <i>destiny</i>.<br> <br> And the problem with destiny is, of course, that she is not always careful where she points her finger. One minute you might be minding your own business on a normal if not spectacular career path, the next you might be in the frame for the big job, like saving the world . . .<br> <br> <i>The Discworld novels can be listened to in any order but </i><b><i>Men At Arms</i></b><i> is the second book in the City Watch series.</i><br> <br> <b>'Funny, wise and mock heroic . . . The funniest and best crafted book I have read all year' </b><i>Sunday Express</i></p>";
