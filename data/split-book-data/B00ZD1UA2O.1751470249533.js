window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Stella Sullivan </i></p> <p><i>Bright. Dedicated. Loyal.</i> </p> <p>The day I walked into his boardroom, I had no idea my life was about to change forever. It was supposed to be a simple proposal that would catapult my career. The chance to help Hurst and McCoy save one of their flailing business lines seemed simple enough. However, I never expected that one look at Maxwell McCoy would have me grasping for control. He's demanding, charming, powerful; most of all he's beautiful, inside and out. As hard as I fought against the attraction, he broke down my defenses. But he's hiding things. Even when secrets, lies, and greed threaten everything I have worked so hard for, I couldn't walk away. There's no denying, the moment my eyes landed on Maxwell McCoy was the moment I became his. </p> <p><i>Maxwell McCoy </i></p> <p><i>Rich. Brilliant. Powerful. </i></p> <p>People only see me as CEO of Hurst and McCoy. The ruthless businessman whose mere presence demands respect. People don't know I chose to leave a life I loved in order to protect my father's legacy and reputation. When my company's future was threatened, I had no choice but to seek assistance. The day Stella Sullivan walked into my boardroom was the day my heart started beating again. One business proposal, from the topaz-eyed beauty, changed my life. She tried to deny our unyielding chemistry, but I wouldn't. I should let her go, but I didn't. </p> <p>The smokescreen I created soon comes crashing down, forcing me to fight for everything I love. </p> <p><i>Due to graphic language and explicit sexual situations, this book is recommended for listeners 18 and up.</i> </p>";
