window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Johnny Decker, #12. Star quarterback for the Boston Tomcats. Two-time Super Bowl MVP...a decade ago. Nickname: \"Decker the Panty Wrecker\".</p> <p>When we lose our beloved team owner, his estranged daughter inherits the Tomcats. I don’t know which is worse—the fact that she’s a finance nerd from New York who knows less than nothing about football...or that I mistook her for a secretary when we first met.</p> <p>She’s stubborn, uptight, infuriating, looks way too good in a skirt, and she’s wrong about absolutely everything—from pizza to how to run my team.</p> <p>We have to learn to work together without kissing or strangling each other.</p> <p>But I can’t stop arguing with her. Even while I’m discovering how good she looks out of a skirt. Even when I’m realizing she might be right about some things after all.</p> <p>I thought I had a winning play. But Hannah Strong changed everything.</p> <p>Duet multicast narration! Performed by Connor Crais and Mackenzie Cartwright, featuring Ava Lucas and Ron Butler</p>";
