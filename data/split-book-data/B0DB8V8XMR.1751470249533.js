window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>He’s the devil. And she’s his wicked game. An enemies-to-lovers dark academia romance with a thrilling twist and epic love story from the disturbed mind that brought you the Darkly, Madly Duet.</p> <p>Halen:</p> <p>They say eyes are the windows to the soul—but when he looks at me through hues of slate-green and flaring blue embers, I’m terrified of what’s watching me from behind his clashing gaze, something primal and feverish that threatens to melt me like fire in ice.</p> <p>I fear falling into Kallum Locke’s pitch-black soul.</p> <p>But after I’m called to a crime scene to investigate the most gruesome act of violence to descend on the legendary town of Hollow’s Row, I have no choice but to turn to Kallum, to the man I had locked away in an asylum for the criminally insane.</p> <p>He’s the leading expert on all things Nietzsche and occult. And now, to get answers, I’m forced to make a deal with the devil himself.</p> <p>Kallum: Really, eyes are the windows to the soul? Then I wonder what little Halen St. James thinks of all the cryptic eyes watching her in the killing fields… I wonder if the hairs on her delicate nape lifted away, if a thrilling shiver raced over her soft skin. She’s desperate for the answer, and she’ll do anything to uncover it—even make a deal with me, dangling freedom like bait on a hook.</p> <p>But she’s far more tempting to sink my teeth into than any lure.</p> <p>And the pain will taste twice as sweet.</p> <p>CW: Full list found on author's website. Serial killers. Plot and plot twists. Slow burn romance. Crime scenes. Dark themes. Violence. Murder. Blood and sharp object play. Occult references. Loss of loved ones (off page).
