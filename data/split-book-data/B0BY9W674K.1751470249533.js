window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>First I was a pack leader. Now? A queen. I thought getting a mate would solve my problems. I thought the Oracle would answer my questions. As it turns out, I was wrong on both counts. Because I have not one, but five mates. They’ve all claimed a piece of me, but instead of making me whole, they’ve torn me apart. The Oracle didn’t answer any questions at all. Instead, she sent me on an even longer quest, with more mysteries than when I began. Now it’s time for me to take charge of my own destiny. If I have to accept these mates in order to save my people from blood-sucking monsters, it’ll happen on my terms. And if I have to travel the continent to fulfill my role as the Queen, I’ll do it my way. To hell with the clan and their rules. This queen is making her own rules.</p> <p><i>Queen Crowned</i> is the third book in The Warrior Queen Legacy, a complete series featuring a badass heroine, a dark fantasy world, and loads of sexy wolf shifters. Be warned: This is a slow burn romance in which the main character keeps all of her men. Once you pick this story up, you won’t be able to stop devouring it until the very last seconds.</p>";
