window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Yes, to the hottest, baddest Fae Kings. No, to being their bitch...</b></p> <p>When my parents mysteriously disappear, leaving me to raise my six crazy, younger siblings, my dreams for college are dashed.</p> <p>It gets worse when someone sends a slew of monster assassins after me and my family. Their untimely arrival is followed by three devastatingly hot Fae assholes who stalk me.</p> <p>Baron, the pompous and dominating Summer King, thinks I'm a dark Fae and wants my head. Then he changes his mind and declares me his fated mate. Hells-a-no. Especially now that he wants me to prove my worth. Really?</p> <p>Then there's Rowan, the possessive and cruel Winter King, who offers to protect me from the assassins, but only if I accept his obnoxious courtship requests.</p> <p>And finally, there's Night King Rydstrom, a dangerous and mysterious Fae with an ass that doesn't quit, who thinks he has every right to play me like a fiddle.</p> <p>Too bad for them, I'm not the docile type they're used to commanding. I might want to screw them, but I have no intention of joining the trail of broken hearts and bodies in their wake.</p> <p>For I hold a deep, dark secret. Their arrival has woken in me the very forbidden magic they've been hunting, and I, Evelina Greene, am going to have a wicked good time teaching these Alpha Fae a lesson.</p> <p><i>Fever Fae</i> is a full-length reverse harem fantasy romance perfect for fans of Ilona Andrews, Sarah J Maas, K. F. Breene, Karen Marie Morning, Leia Stone, Jaymin Eve, and Amelia Hutchins.</p>";
