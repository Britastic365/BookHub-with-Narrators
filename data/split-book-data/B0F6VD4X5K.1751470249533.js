window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Indulge in a multi-mega cast of 8 narrators!</p> <p>Three sexy vampires haunt my dreams, and they love to make me scream. For all the right reasons.</p> <p>A dark TikTok-viral vampire romance with heart-pumping spice and suspense like you've never read before!</p> <p>The nightmares started on Monsters Night. I figured my overactive libido was just tripping out because of all the monsters on the news. Some portal opened up, and they were terrorizing humans in particular.</p> <p>But seriously, who hasn’t thought about that monster under the bed in a sensual light? There’s just something about danger, about fangs, about long tongues…So, I let the dreams happen. I invite them in.</p> <p>But one night, when I open my eyes and they’re literally feasting on me... I realize it’s no dream.</p> <p>This is real.---\"Get off me!\" I scream, not because it doesn't feel good what the one with an unnaturally long tongue is doing, but because this was supposed to be a dream.</p> <p>\"Not a chance, sigil.\"</p> <p>Why do they always call me that?</p> <p>I move to push the one between my legs away, but I realize I can't. My muscles don't comply.</p> <p>Red eyes glow at my right. Eyes that belong to a face crafted by a master sculptor, but his fangs dripping with my blood suggest he's anything but a benevolent being. \"You're far too delicious to release now. Plus, you invited us into your mind. You told us to play.\"</p> <p>Yes, but that had been when this was all a fanciful dream full of forbidden desires.</p> <p>I opened my mouth to say as much, but the creature on my right groaned at the sight. \"Yes, open that mouth wide, our sigil. We're starved for more of your screams.\"</p> <p>Their Blood Queen is a standalone paranormal romance with monstrous vampires that feed on blood and dreams from their chosen mate.</p>";
