She’s never seen someone so comfortable in his own skin, and she’d like nothing more than to see all of it. Every bare inch. From his delicious tattoos to his bedroom eyes, Thorne is a dirty fantasy come true. But fantasy is one thing. An arranged marriage is another.</p> <p>As they get acquainted, their chemistry is <i>royally hot</i>. But when surrounded by dark betrayal and devious schemes, can Thorne and Nova learn to trust each other...or will their families’ rivalry prove too great a hurdle?</p>";
