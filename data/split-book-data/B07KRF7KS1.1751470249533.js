window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The second book in a thrilling sci-fi action adventure, set on Donovan, a treacherous alien planet where corporate threats and dangerous creatures imperil the lives of the planet's colonists. </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author W. Michael Gear returns us to the world he laid out with such sure purpose in </b><b><i>Outpost</i></b><b>. </b></p> <p>The struggle for survival sharpens as resources dwindle, technology fails, and the grim reality of life on Donovan unfolds. Supervisor Kalico Aguila has bet everything on a fragile settlement far south of Port Authority. There, she has carved a farm and mine out of wilderness. But Donovan is closing in. </p> <p>When conditions couldn't get worse, a murderous peril descends out of Donovan's sky - one that will leave Kalico bleeding and shattered. Talina Perez gambles her life and reputation in a bid to atone for ruthlessly murdering a woman's husband years ago. Ironically, saving Dya Simonov may save them all.</p> <p>Lieutenant Deb Spiro is losing it, and by killing a little girl's pet alien, she may have precipitated disaster for all. In the end, the only hope will lie with a \"lost\" colony, and the alien-infested reflexes possessed by Security Officer Talina Perez. </p> <p>On Donovan, only human beings are more terrifying than the wildlife.</p>";
