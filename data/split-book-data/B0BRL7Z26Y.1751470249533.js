window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>All stars must fall.</p> <p>Bloody, lost, broken. We live to fight another day. But with so much stolen from us, can the fates ever twist in our favour again?</p> <p>My sister and I have been torn apart by shadows and despair, and now we each stand alone.</p> <p>Our sorrow is spun like a web, trapping us tight, and I fear our enemies will soon come to feast upon our souls.</p> <p>But if I have my way, the merciless sky will have dealt us its final fortune. It’s time for us to take back the power that’s been ripped from our grasp and turn the tide of this war.</p> <p>All stars must fall, and all Phoenixes must rise.</p> <p>Long live the Savage Queens.</p> <p>This will now be book 8 of 9 in the series.</p> <p>This is a dark, bully romance–don’t go expecting a sweet school for magic with friends around every corner. Fae fight for everything they own and Zodiac Academy is a cutthroat school for students aged 18+ where only the strongest prevail. There’s no Dumbledore here to save anyone’s ass and Lionel Acrux will give Voldemort a run for his money in the evil dictator category. So hold onto your stardust (broomsticks not required) and get ready for a bumpy ride.</p>";
