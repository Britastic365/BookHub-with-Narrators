window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Half-vampire Catherine Crawfield is going after the undead with a vengeance, hoping that one of these deadbeats is her father—the one responsible for ruining her mother's life. Then she's captured by Bones, a vampire bounty hunter, and is forced into an unholy partnership.</p> <p>In exchange for finding her father, Cat agrees to train with the sexy night stalker until her battle reflexes are as sharp as his fangs. She's amazed she doesn't end up as his dinner—are there actually good vampires? Pretty soon Bones will have her convinced that being half-dead doesn't have to be all bad. But before she can enjoy her newfound status as kick-ass demon hunter, Cat and Bones are pursued by a group of killers. Now Cat will have to choose a side... and Bones is turning out to be as tempting as any man with a heartbeat.</p> <p>Performed by Danny Gavigan, Holly Adams, Christopher Graybill, David Cui Cui, Christopher Walker, Alex Hill-Knight, Yasmin Tuazon, Alysia Beltran, Andrew James Spooner, Bianca Bryan, Chris Davenport, Chris Stinson, Earl Fisher, Ian Putnam, James J.
