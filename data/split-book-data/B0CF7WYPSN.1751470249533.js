window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Betrayal. Chaos. Love.</p> <p>I came to Black Veil for a new start. A chance to find myself again, and maybe learn how to control my unruly magic.</p> <p>Instead, I've somehow bonded myself to three amazing men, found out I'm mated to my childhood best friend, and my magic grows more unstable by the day.</p> <p>Danger lurks around every corner and death lingers in the air. Secrets are uncovered, questions answered, but I'm not entirely sure I'm prepared to face the truths that they bring.</p> <p><i>Knight Forsaken</i> is book 3 of 5 in the Black Veil University. This is a university-aged, paranormal RH romance which means there will be no choosing between love interests at the end of the story.</p> <p>This series has darker elements that listeners should be aware of such as strong language, PTSD from kidnapping, assault, and violence.</p>";
