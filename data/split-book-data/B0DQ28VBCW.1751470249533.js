window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Being an Omega used to be the dream everyone wanted. Now it's a nightmare.</b></p> <p>Packs are a thing of the past, black market dealers kidnap Omegas off the street, and the ones that escape are little better than pawns for the government to control.</p> <p>So when my designation revealed itself in the worst situation possible, I ran. Or I tried to. While trying to escape, I found myself in an even worse fate at the hands of my abuser—my father. Now that he knows I'm an Omega he sees me as nothing more than a commodity, locking me away until he could legally sell me to the highest bidder.</p> <p>Risking death, I take my one and only chance to break free. My only hope now is to seek help in the only place I think I can trust. And I find more than just shelter. I find love, affection, and the pack I always dreamed of having. But Omegas are still the most coveted object in this world that's as broken as I am; and even the men who've started to heal my heart may not be able to save me.</p> <p><i>This is an Omegaverse that is also polyamorous romance where the leading lady doesn't have to choose who she loves or how many—nor do her lovers. Contains mature content. A complete list of content warnings can be found on the author's website.</i></p>";
