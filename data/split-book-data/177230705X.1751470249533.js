window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Dirty Bad Things</i> contains all three standalone audiobooks in the dirty, filthy, and oh-so-sweet Dirty Bad Things series.</p> <p><i>Hard Core</i>, book 1:</p> <p>Trust me, I’m no porn star. But when the Moretti crime family comes calling to collect on a debt I owe, they want it in trade. You see, there’s big money in dirty movies, and the more real, the better. Me? I’m already damaged goods from my time in Afghanistan. But then I meet Rose, my “co-star,” and my whole world shatters. She owes the Morettis too, but she’s too good for all of this. Too sweet, too beautiful - too innocent. And I’ll be damned if I let them steal that away from her. It’s wrong that she’s here, but it’s also wrong that she wants me to “teach her” things. It’s worse that I want to. One touch of her soft skin, and I know Rose is going to be mine.</p> <p>The virgin with the debt, the ex-marine with the d*ck, and a porno for the mob. Welcome to Vegas, baby.</p> <p><i>Pretty Dirty</i>, book 2:</p> <p>Heard the one about the filthy rich mob lawyer and the cam girl with the broken past? Yeah, me neither. I wasn’t looking for temptation, but I sure as sh*t found it. The ink and the piercings. Those scars, just like mine. One look at Zoe, and I’m hooked. So I bought her. Fifty grand for three weeks, and she’s all mine. She needs saving, but helping Zoe means crossing my employers - the dangerous Moretti crime family that runs Las Vegas.</p> <p>But I can’t resist that sweet little body that’s begging to be claimed, or the soft, sultry way she says “harder” and “deeper.” I can’t tell her no when all I want to tell her is to get on her f--king knees and say yes sir. So I’ll keep her. I’ll protect her. And I’ll stop at nothing to keep her safe.</p> <p><i>Rough Stuff</i>, book 3:</p> <p>Fiery red hair, sweet curves that that <i>melt</i> me, and a sass that makes my blood run hot. I’m supposed to be Quinn’s bodyguard. The only problem? We’ve met before. One night, no names, nothing held back, when I claimed her as my own. Rough, hard - exactly how she wanted it. Her hair wrapped around my fist and her moans etched across my brain.</p> <p>My boss, the vicious head of the Moretti crime family, thinks she’s his. He thinks he can lock her away in some tower like a little bird in a glass cage and claim her as his own. He’s about to learn how wrong he is. I’ll guard that body all right, and I’ll burn down heaven and hell to make sure they all know that she’s mine.</p> <p><i>Dirty, filthy, and oh-so-sweet, with an utterly obsessed alpha hero, explosive insta-love, and enough audio-melting steam to make you sweat. HEA with no cheating.</i></p>";
