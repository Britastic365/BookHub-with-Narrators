window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The next audiobook in <i>New York Times</i> and <i>USA Today</i> best-selling author Katie MacAlister's paranormal romance series, sure to appeal to fans of Lynsay Sands. </p> <p>Fans of Lyndsay Sands and Gena Showalter will love <i>New York Times </i>best-selling author Katie MacAlister's fiery paranormal romance about a dragon shifter who finds his soul mate in the most unlikely place. </p> <p>With dragons like him, who needs enemies? </p> <p>Real scholars know that supernatural beings aren't real. But the moment I meet Archer Andras of the Storm Dragons, all my academic training goes out the window. Thanks to Mr. Tall, Dark, and Infuriating, I'm learning that I really should worry about those things that go bump in the night...and that dragons like Archer are 100 percent pure trouble. </p> <p>Now, I'm caught in the middle of a war. On one side is Archer. On the other is his twin brother. And I am the key to translating an ancient text that could bring balance - or deadly ruin - to our world. But none of that is as dangerous as the seriously sexy sparks between Archer and I. He's too tempting to be real. Too gorgeous to trust. And when it comes to dragons, there's no smoke without deadly fire. </p>";
