window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Jenna McInnis lives alone in the backwoods of Maine, and she likes it that way. </p> <p>Unfortunately, her antisocial calm and quiet is about to be disrupted by John Merck, an undercover cop whose big drug bust has gone horribly awry. Breaking into her house, the intimidating man hopes to find some kind of treatment for the gunshot he sustained during the firefight. </p> <p>Instead, he finds a woman who is more than a match for him, even when he is nearly dead. </p> <p>He owes her his life. He desperately wants to give her his heart. But he cannot do that without putting her in terrible danger. </p> <p>So he makes a choice, the hardest one of his life, trying to do the noble - the best - thing for her, even if it means never seeing her again. </p> <p>Publisher's Note: What begins as a terrifying experience quickly evolves into a love story, with steamy sexual scenes and domestic discipline. If such material offends you, please do not purchase. </p>";
