window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Emeline may have been alive for hundreds of years, but she's never really lived. Using her knowledge and research, she helped save the Redwood Pack from devastation. However, she's never felt whole, not since she lost her mate so long ago. Now there is a new, younger wolf entering her life, and it will take more than her nose in a book to figure out that the warmth in her heart is much more than a promise of a new feeling. It's fate. </p> <p>Noah has known Emeline was his mate since he first saw her, only he doesn't know if she feels the same. He's always been on the fringes of those in power in the pack, and he has enjoyed it. Now he's become an integral piece and wants to find a way to bring Emeline with him. Her reluctance to date a much younger wolf isn't the only hurdle in his way. </p> <p>When he finally takes the step, he'll have to pray she finds the connection and lets fate save them both. As they find their way to a mating bond, a player from the past is out to hold them back, and everything they think they have might be lost forever. </p>";
