The only thing I am sure of is him. Ace Wilde is the darkness that shadows run from and now he has me in his sights. Our bond is inescapable. He says he can teach me how to be fearless, but at what cost? My mind? My soul? My heart? The moment we met I knew I would gladly give away all three for a chance to lie with the devil. If love makes a person go mad, then I accept my diagnosis.</p> <p>Babydoll is a sick and twisted Harley Quinn and Joker retelling. The story follows psychology student Harlow as she navigates her growing fascination for the dark and disturbed Ace Wilde. He wants to corrupt her by pulling her into hell with him.
