window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When angels fall, Hell will rise. <br> <br> Lucifer isn’t Hell’s only devil. When a powerful angel purposely abandons Heaven, their descent creates a new level of torment in Hell’s kingdom. If only it didn’t take me nearly dying by the hands of my ex-fiancé to discover this. I could’ve begged for a miracle, or at least mercy.<br> <br> Now, the best I can hope for is a crappy deal with Hell’s most notorious ruler, and some twisted help from my new devil soul keepers.<br> <br> Lucifer, Kase, and Dante need me to force the rest of their traitorous brethren to fall from grace and take their rightful places to bring Hell’s kingdom to its intended glory. I’m the only one who can complete the task—whether or not I want to—because of my angel-kissed soul. I unknowingly made an angel fall in another life, and am the perfect angel bait.<br> <br> Corrupting some angels sounds easy, right? Unfortunately, the divine brethren aren’t the sweet, innocent angels I’ve heard about. These guys are fierce, and won’t think twice before smiting me. To survive the power struggle between the angels and devils and save my soul, I need to embrace my wicked side or summon a miracle. If I can’t, my eternity is over. The rulers of Hell and the saviors of Heaven will rip me apart. My soul will burn.</p> <p>This is a dark and addictive romance with possible triggering situations, gore, violence, and M/M. If you like psycho, protective men, fast-burn goodness, and a woman who doesn’t shy away from embracing her devilish side, <i>Her Personal Demons</i> is a must-listen. Enter Hell’s kingdom and meet the devils today! </p>";
