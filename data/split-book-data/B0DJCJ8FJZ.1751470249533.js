A woman determined to forget him...</b></p> <p>I knew the moment I laid eyes on Selina Grymes she was the girl I was going to marry. We made plans to grow old together, have children, and live the rest of our lives here in Tyson's Creek. But once we graduated high school, she left town and never returned, taking my heart with her.</p> <p>Selina disappeared for fifteen long years without a word, before suddenly reappearing in town and turning my entire world upside down. I know I should keep my distance and protect my heart from being broken a second time, but all I can think about is making her mine again.</p> <p>But Selina doesn't plan on staying here longer than it takes for her injury to heal and then she'll disappear again. I'll stop at nothing to prove to her that we belong together, even if it means giving up everything I've built to be with her.</p> <p><i>For mature listeners.</i></p>";
