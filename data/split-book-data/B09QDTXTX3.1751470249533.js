window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The alpha rejecting me was just the start of my revenge….</b></p> <p>Being an outcast of the wolves was always something I accepted until I met them. The four alpha wolves of Fall Mountain Pack. They showed me I could be so much more than the rejected wolf they found on a beach and saved. They healed me and made me stronger, fixing what was broken in my soul.</p> <p><i>But they lied.</i></p> <p>Dragged back to the Ravensword Pack, I learn who I am before being left in the hands of the alpha I ran from, starting a war no one can stop. The past that I couldn’t remember has caught up with us, and it turns out they were always a part of it. They aren’t just alpha wolves and our fates are as intertwined as Hades and Persephone’s were.</p> <p>I never thought being rejected would lead me to my past, but it has, and my past comes with more than a bite<i>.</i></p> <p><i>It comes with wings.</i></p> <p>This is a full-length reverse harem romance novel full of sexy alpha males, steamy scenes, a strong heroine and a lot of sarcasm. Intended for mature listeners.</p>";
