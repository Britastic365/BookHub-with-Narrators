window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Charlotte Davenport is a woman on a singular mission: get onto a ship bound for Atlantis by any means necessary, and get home to her sister. When she joins the crew of the Malediction, she has no idea she's made herself an unwitting captive of its pirate captain. Captain Lirian Jurel is cocky and secretive and infuriatingly handsome, and she can't shake the feeling that he's laughing at her . . . but Charlotte has a secret of her own, and she'll do anything to keep it.</p> <p>Captain Lirian Jurel has only one thing on his mind—the next adventure. F--king, feasting, and fighting—it's a pirate's life for him. He's never been able to stay away from danger, and Charlotte Davenport—the impudent little witch disguising herself as a member of his crew—seems like the most dangerous creature he's ever encountered.</p> <p>Striking a bargain to bring her home is an easy trade for having her warm in his bed . . . But bringing her home means saying goodbye, which is harder than he anticipated.</p> <p>When you're a vicious sea monster like him, being alone is the wisest course of action, but once they reach Atlantis, Lirian vows to help Charlotte see her journey through—wherever it leads.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
