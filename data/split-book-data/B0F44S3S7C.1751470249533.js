And he certainly never imagined standing between a tyrant and the fate of a galaxy.</p> <p><b>Destiny doesn’t wait for permission.</b></p> <p>From the mystical world of Avalyeth, Thomas’ journey will lead him and his growing crew into the heart of enemy territory, the halls of ancient dragons, and the path of knights who remember a time when hope still burned bright. Hunted by the Draconite and haunted by the past, they’ll need to risk everything to outmaneuver and overcome those who would see them destroyed.</p> <p>As new alliances form and old rivalries re-ignite, Thomas must prove he’s more than just the captain of a legendary starship—he must become the leader others believe him to be.</p> <p>Even if he still isn’t sure he believes it himself.</p>";
