You've met Mercy before in The Legacy of a Vampire Witch and The Blood Witch Saga. She's fought against devils and demons, insidious witches, and old-world vampires. When she returns to Exeter, where she grew up as a girl, she'll find enemies even bigger and badder than anything she's ever faced before.</p> <p>A great series for fans of the True Blood / Sookie Stackhouse novels or the Underworld franchise to sink their fangs into.
