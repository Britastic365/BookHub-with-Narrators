window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Hadley Jacobs is over Machlan Gibson. </p> <p>Sure, she’ll always be a little weak to the dimple in his right cheek and the way his five o’clock shadow makes him ruggedly handsome. But that’s not enough to cover every other thing about him because they all drive her nuts. Like how he won’t admit he’s wrong even when he knows it and how he drives his stupid car a million miles an hour on wet asphalt. As she rolls back into town and takes a seat at Crave, she won’t take the bait. She’s over him. Mostly.</p> <p>Machlan isn’t over her. </p> <p>It’s not because he hasn’t tried. He reminds himself over and over that she’s not the girl for him. After all, she drives him insane with her sassy attitude and the way she calls him out on everything. She beats him at poker, even though she doesn’t know the difference between a straight and a flush, and when she looks at him with her bright, blue eyes, it’s unnerving. When she climbs onto that bar stool and orders a drink, he puts it in front of her and ignores the sparkle in her eyes. He’s not over her, but she won’t know that. </p> <p>But she does know that. And he knows she’s not as over him as she’s pretending to be. When life forces their hand this time, there’s more on the line than a pile of poker chips. It’s their forever. </p> <p><i>Crave </i>is a second-chance standalone romance in a new small-town, blue-collar series from <i>USA Today</i> best-selling author Adriana Locke. Join listeners everywhere as they fall in love with the delicious Gibson Boys.</p>";
