window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I've got a big dick and an even bigger bank account. That's pretty much where my bio ends. Honestly, I don't need to say anything else. I've just sold 99 percent of women on going home with me. Do I sound like an asshole to you? That's because I am. And guess what? It works for me just fine. Or at least it did...until I met her. </p> <p>Books talk about sparks flying. F--k that shit. With her, it was like emergency flares mixed with jet fuel. Or maybe just straight up napalm. Only one problem: She wouldn't tell me her name or her number when she disappeared from the hotel room after the hottest f--king night of my life. Now I've had a taste of unicorn pussy - the sweetest, rarest of all pussy - and I need it again. So what's an asshole to do? I took this problem to the street, a missed connection gone viral. And when I find her? I'm keeping her. </p>";
