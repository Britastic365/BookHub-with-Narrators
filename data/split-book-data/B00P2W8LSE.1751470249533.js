Carnal pleasure is utterly forbidden, and though he has always overcome temptation with an iron will, his control is about to shatter. </p> <p>She is Keeleycael. The Red Queen. When the powerful beauty with shocking vulnerabilities escapes from a centuries-long imprisonment, the desire that simmers between her and Torin is scorching.
