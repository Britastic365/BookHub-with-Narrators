window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Poisonous. Dangerous. Brutal.</b></p> <p>Thornfield Academy is a place where I, Ivy Hammond, blend in with the everyday supernatural creatures that flock these halls. But when darkness falls, I embrace my calling. I'm a shapeshifting assassin, summoned through a combination of ancient rituals and the dark web to deliver supernatural justice where mortal laws fail.</p> <p>This me is called Poison, and I'm a master of secrets. But when an assignment comes up, for the first time, I can't complete a job, and it could end up being my last days. My bosses are not the type of creatures you want to mess with, but this one… strikes too close to home.</p> <p>To make this more complicated, I'm drawn to three men I should avoid at all costs. They are brutal, they are arrogant and they want what they can't have: Poison.</p> <p>Torin Ashford: the charming vampire sub-boss of the Ainsley Coven, a powerful supernatural syndicate I've crossed paths with before.</p> <p>Bram Sinclair: the Dark Fae enforcer with magic as ancient and treacherous as the wild forests that surround the academy.</p> <p>Tate Blackwell: the protective warlock whose spells might be my salvation or my doom.</p> <p>All three are bound by immortal oaths, arcane dangers, and mystical ties that now involve me.</p> <p>As our worlds collide and blood loyalties are tested, I must decide whether to fade into the shadows and run or stand and fight against the beings who own my soul.</p> <p>But escaping isn't as simple as that, and when my next contract reaches its deadline, I face a choice that could lead to my ultimate destruction.</p> <p><i>This is a dark paranormal academia reverse harem.
