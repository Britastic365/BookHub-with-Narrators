But Kenzie’s not just any woman. She’s the most volatile of the Horsemen that rule the Island of Ys.</p> <p><b>He’s the one she’s never forgotten…</b></p> <p>With the Horsemen’s revenge plot finally picking up speed, the last thing Kenzie needs is the distraction Liam offers. If she had a little more self-control, maybe she could keep her hands off him, but Kenzie and self-control have never been on speaking terms. Determined to have her cake and eat it too, Kenzie offers Liam a bargain—a seven-day fling and then he leaves the island forever.</p> <p><b>To have a chance, they have to risk it all…</b></p> <p>The Horsemen’s enemies are circling, and it’s never been more hazardous to be attached to the Island of Ys. All Liam wants to do is protect Kenzie from the demons of her past, but with the clock ticking down and her trust in short supply, they’re both in more danger than either of them could have dreamed.</p>";
