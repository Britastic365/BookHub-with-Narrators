window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Clara</b><br> <b>Unfairly convicted of a crime, I’m sent to serve the Kadrixan males for their rutting season. </b><br> <br> The Kadrixans. Even their name inspires terror. Fiery-skinned and devil-like, they stand head and shoulders taller than any human man. Our colony made a terrible bargain with these monsters. The Kadrixans give us precious ore in exchange for the one thing they need.<br> <br> Women. Like me.<br> <br> When we meet our Kadrixan captors, I come face to face with a massive, brawny beast who claims I belong to him.<br> And not just for the rutting season. He wants me forever.<br> <br> <b>Krxare </b><br> <b>I never expected to claim a human mate, but one look at the curvy female and I know she’s mine. </b><br> <br> Hunger claws at my mind and that of every other warrior in my regiment. All of us are on the brink of the rut which makes us more belligerent with each passing day. Without females, we’ll tear each other apart with rage.<br> <br> We depend upon our bargain. Human females for Kadrixan ore.<br> <br> The females arrive and there is one who stirs my primitive desire: Clara. She thinks I’m a monster; I see it in her eyes and scent it in her fear. She vows to return to her people after the rut is over, but I vow to claim my mate, to woo her and prove she’s mine.</p>";
