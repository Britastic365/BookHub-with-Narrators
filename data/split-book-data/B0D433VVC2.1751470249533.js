window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Our lands are changing, three becoming one, merged together by my sister and her monsters.</b></p> <p>The magic has returned and new life blooms. No longer are the Dead Lands dismal and gray, but not everyone welcomes the change.</p> <p>I expected to die when I threw myself from the Gilded Land's tower. Instead, I found myself surrounded by the monsters I feared the most.</p> <p>I assumed they'd be feral and dangerous. I didn't expect them to show me the world, to fill my broken, darkened soul with light.</p> <p>My name is Kai Black and I'm no longer the woman stolen by the Gilded King. I've been shattered and remade into something different. Something new.</p> <p>If only I had known that I would be re-born from darkness, the same darkness that the monsters find me in. If only I'd known who the real monsters are.</p> <p>Shadows save us. Shadows guide us. Shadows heal me.</p> <p><i>This is a dark romance intended for mature listeners.</i></p>";
