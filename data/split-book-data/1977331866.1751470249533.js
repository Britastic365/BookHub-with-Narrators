window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>With Halloween just a week away, tea-shop proprietor Kylie Strange doesn't have much in the way of holiday spirit. She's just learned that the last day of October also heightens the power of magic - which means the potential for a tidal wave of evil creatures to emerge from that supernatural Booke of the Hidden. </p> <p>Destroying the ancient Booke once and for all is the ultimate solution. But the only way to accomplish this task involves a journey to the Netherworld and the help of the only being powerful enough to destroy the Booke: Satan himself. And though the brooding and elusive Erasmus Dark has captured Kylie's heart against her better judgment, she ignores his repeated warnings that the mission guarantees her doom. </p> <p>With Kylie in the Netherworld, her coven must stave off the onslaught of deadly creatures that emerge from the Booke - as well as hold back the encroaching destruction of the maniacal god Baphomet. Luckily, they're joined by some unlikely friends in their fight against total annihilation. But now Kylie's journey becomes a rescue mission, and if she can't complete her task and return from the Netherworld, all will be lost for the inhabitants of Moody Bog...and the rest of humanity. </p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
