window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Twenty thrilling writers. One chilling mystery.</b> </p> <p>Pericles \"Perry\" Christo is a P.I. with a past. A one-time NYPD homicide cop, Perry has been struggling since he lost his badge, and his marriage, in a notorious corruption scandal. So when wealthy Upper East Side matron Julia Drusilla calls him one cold February night, he jumps at the chance to work what seems to be a straightforward (and lucrative) case. Julia needs Perry to track down the whereabouts of her beautiful yet aimless daughter, Angelina, who is about to become a very wealthy young heiress. </p> <p>But as Perry digs deeper, he discovers there's much more to the story of the lovely \"Angel.\" Her father, her best friend, her boyfriend - they all have agendas of their own. This classic noir tale twists and turns down New York's mean streets and around Hampton's beaches and back roads, during a bitterly cold and gray winter - where nothing is as it seems and everyone has something to hide. </p> <p>Told in the same \"serial novel\" format that made 2011's <i>No Rest for the Dead</i> such a commercial and critical success, <i>Inherit the Dead</i> is a collaboration among 20 of today's best-selling mystery and thriller authors each taking a chapter of the narrative and infusing it with their signature style. </p> <p>The editor, Jonathan Santlofer, has arranged to donate any royalties in excess of editor and contributor compensation to Safe Horizon, a leading provider of services to victims of violence and abuse, making this a worthy and winning accomplishment that showcases today's finest writers at their very best. </p>";
