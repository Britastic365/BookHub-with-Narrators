window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Isaac has never been what he seems.</p> <p>Rumor has it that gruff, brooding, and solitary man-of-mystery Isaac Sylvester is back in town, and the only thing folks in Green Valley know for certain is that this prodigal son’s motives are as elusive as he is. He’s been spotted loitering near the old Townsen farm, hanging around the Hill's homestead, and glaring menacingly from the edges of The Donner Lodge’s parking lot. What this hometown-hero-turned-criminal wants, no one knows. Nor can they stop talking about it.</p> <p>Hannah's last night as an exotic dancer might just be her most memorable. Hannah Townsen has often been a subject of local gossip. Folks shook their heads when Hannah's daddy ran out on her momma; folks blessed her heart after Hannah's momma had that tragic accident; and folks really talked up a tizzy when Hannah became an exotic dancer in order to pay off her parents' debt and put food on the table. But now, ten years after being dubbed as a hometown-stripper-with-a-heart-of-gold, Hannah has seemingly—and finally—fallen off the gossip mill's radar.</p> <p>That is, until the enigmatic Isaac Sylvester shows up at Hannah's retirement party wanting so much more than a private dance. . .</p> <p>All Folked Up' is the third book in the Good Folk series and is a full-length, small town, contemporary romantic comedy novel.</p>";
