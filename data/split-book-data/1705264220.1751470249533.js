window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>It takes a lot to rile me up. From the moment I meet the young widow, she gets under my skin. I want to kiss her. But only to shut her up. </b></p> <p>My name is Maccabe Donahue, but everyone calls me Mac. Just out of the Navy and current Devil's Rider, the inner circle of the Sons of Satan motorcycle club, I'm known for keeping a cool head. But all that changes when I take the job of managing the build of a new development outside of town. </p> <p>A development that is right next door to a tiny cottage, formerly in the middle of nowhere. That's where Suzanna comes in. </p> <p>The woman is going to drive me insane. </p> <p>She's the best-looking woman I've ever seen. Long legs and long, dark hair, with big green eyes and a curvaceous figure that defies gravity. She's all fire and vinegar wrapped up in a package that makes my hands itch to touch her.</p> <p>When those sparks combust, it sets off a chain reaction neither of us saw coming.</p> <p><i>Contains mature themes.</i></p>";
