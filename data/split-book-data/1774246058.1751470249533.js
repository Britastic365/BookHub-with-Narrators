window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Everyone thought I was living a fairy tale; marrying a prince and living happily ever after. But that only happens in movies.</b></p> <p>I was actually in a living a nightmare...in a gilded cage that was crushing my soul.</p> <p>A terrorist attack almost took my life and that of my bodyguard, Lennox. We were trapped together and forced to face things we had been trying to deny, and we could no longer ignore our overwhelming connection. Leave it to me to do the stupidest thing possible and fall for my bodyguard, but there was no fighting it. It made me realize how much my life had been lived for others: my family, the royals, and Theo. But once you are a part of the royal family, you can’t just walk away. Especially when you find yourself engaged and being groomed to become queen.</p> <p>With royalty threatening and blackmailing me, Theo insisting we stay the course, and constant observers waiting for me to fail, I have no choice but to play the game. But secrets have a way of getting out...and the world wants to break what’s left of me.</p>";
