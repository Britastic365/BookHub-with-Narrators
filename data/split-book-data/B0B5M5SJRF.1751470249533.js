window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Immerse yourself in the second book in a fantasy trilogy from the </b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>bestselling author of the Ash Pricess series. The sequel to </b><b><i>Castles in Their Bones</i></b><b> is the story of three princesses and the destiny they were born for: seduction, conquest, and the crown.</b></p> <p>Princesses Daphne, Beatriz, and Sophronia have trained their entire lives for one purpose: to bring down nations. Their mother, Empress Margaraux of Bessemia, is determined to rule the continent of Vesteria, and her daughters are her weapons. Promised for marriage since birth, they are her ticket across enemy lines. And also her decoys.</p> <p>Still, not even Empress Margaraux can control the stars. Sent to their new kingdoms, orders in hand, the princesses have found their own paths, changing the course of their mother’s plans entirely—and tragically. Sophronia chose love, and for that, she lost her life.</p> <p>Daphne and Beatriz can hardly believe their sister is dead, but both are determined to avenge her. And now, separated by a continent—and their mother’s lies—they see more clearly with every passing day that they might not be working toward the same end.</p> <p>The stars whisper of death, but Daphne and Beatriz are just beginning to understand the true power coursing through their veins. And their mother will do anything to keep them under her thumb—even if it means killing them all.</p>";
