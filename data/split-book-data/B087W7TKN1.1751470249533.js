Long enough to learn exactly what Nyquist is planning and figure out a way to stop him. He can’t get away with this. I will fight him as long as it takes, even if it kills me. </p> <p><b>You will love the continuation of this magical academy series with kick-ass action, hot romance, and earth-shattering magic that will make you tingle in all the right places.</b></p> <p><b>Get it now.</b></p>";
