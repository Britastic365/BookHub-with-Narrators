window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>No last names. No life stories. Those were the rules. </p> <p>Once upon a time a cocky, copper-haired tourist sauntered into Zara's bar. And even though she knew better, Zara indulged in a cure for the small-town blues. It was supposed to be an uncomplicated fling - a few sizzling weeks before he went back to his life, and she moved on. Until an accidental pregnancy changed her life. </p> <p>Two years later, she's made peace with the notion that Dave No-Last-Name will never be found - until one summer day when he walks into her coffee shop, leveling her with the same hot smile that always renders her defenseless. </p> <p>Dave Beringer has never forgotten the intense month he spent with prickly Zara. Their nights together were the first true intimacy he'd ever experienced. But the discovery of his child is the shock of a lifetime, and his ugly past puts relationships and family out of reach. </p> <p>Or does it? Vermont's countryside has a way of nurturing even tortured souls. The fields and the orchards - and hard-won love - are bountiful. </p>";
