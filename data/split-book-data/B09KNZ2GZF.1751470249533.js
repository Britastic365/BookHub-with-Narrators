window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>There's nothing stronger than love, except maybe desperation.</b> </p> <p>All Jade wanted was her own happily ever after. Unfortunately, it's never that easy. Being a woman and a mage complicates things. Falling for three men at the same time? At least that's working out. </p> <p>Everything else is a mess. </p> <p>And it's all the Spider's fault. That man just can't help himself. He wants power, and Xel is the best source he's ever found. To fuel his own addiction, the Spider will destroy everything in his path - including the quiet little village of pirates and whores that Jade has claimed as her own. </p> <p>But everyone has a price. For Jade and her men, it's the people they care about. For the first time, they've found a family, and the Spider wants to destroy that too. After all, his goal is pain. He doesn't even care whose. </p> <p>The only way to stop this is to go for the source. If the Sultan is this desperate to have his mage wars, then she'll play. After all, Jade has mastered the one weapon these men won't even consider.</p> <p>Love - it cuts both ways. </p> <p><b><i>Spell of Love</i></b><i> is intended for a mature audience due to the presence of consensual adult scenes, group adult scenes, M/M scenes, and plenty of vulgar language - as well as some potentially triggering violence - since the bad guys don't always play nice. While this is a love story, it may not be right for all listeners.</i></p>";
