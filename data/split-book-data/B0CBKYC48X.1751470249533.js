I must have pissed off karma or something because there is no way being trapped. Alone. In the dark. With not one, not two, but FOUR sexy athletes can be a good thing. Especially not when they make the most outrageous bet. Who can please me the best? Puh-leaze.</p> <p>I’m not an easy girl. I’ve got plans for myself. Graduate and become the best journalist I can be. I don’t have time for one boyfriend, much less a whole harem of them. No, thank you. But one night? I can probably swing that. So long as no one gets attached.</p> <p>I’ve got 99 problems, but heart break isn’t going to be one … or is it?</p> <p>This Volume Contains the Following Titles:</p> <p>Study Break: A Steamy Contemporary Reverse Harem</p> <p>Tough Break: A Steamy Contemporary Reverse Harem</p> <p>***This is a Reverse Harem romance.
