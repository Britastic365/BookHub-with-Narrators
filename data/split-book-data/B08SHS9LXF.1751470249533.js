window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Four sexy dragon shifters. A huntress with a dark past. A bond that could save the world.</b> </p> <p>I’ve spent my entire life running from my past and staying out of trouble. That’s how I’ve kept alive ever since my parents were killed by the Black Dragon, who’s ruled the world under her oppressive talons for as long as anyone can remember. </p> <p>But it’s hard to keep a low profile when four handsome strangers turn up in your village claiming you’re destined to save the world. According to them, they’ve been chosen by the gods to become elemental dragons — and I’m their fated mate. </p> <p>Which means one day I’ll be the most powerful dragon of all, able to control all four elements. Assuming I can unlock my powers first…by getting intimate with each of my sexy mates. </p> <p>Auric, the clever prince. Jasin, the cocky soldier. Slade, the protective blacksmith. Reven, the mysterious assassin. And me. We’re the only ones who can bring balance to the world and overthrow the Black Dragon — if she doesn’t tear us to shreds first. </p> <p>But as we continue our journey, secrets are uncovered about my mates that make me question everything, even as things heat up between us. Yet the greatest secret of all lies in my own past — and it might destroy us completely. </p> <p><i>This collection contains all five novels in the Her Elemental Dragons series — Stroke the Flame, Kiss the Sky, Shake the Earth, Ride the Wave, and Embrace the Dark — as well as the prequel novella, Light the Fire.</i> </p>";
