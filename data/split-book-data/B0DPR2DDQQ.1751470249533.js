window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This short story collection will take you into the depths of Beck’s dark imagination: from what happens when the deepest bore hole on Earth has just passed nine miles and hits a strange open space – and it's hellishly hot down there; to an Antarctic research team examining fragments from a deep ice glacier and discovers a tiny seed that, once thawed, grows into something terrifyingly unexpected.</p> <p>Then there’s the real story of the Titanic, where something horrifying boards the grand ship, and it’s sunk, intentionally – to protect us all. And Beck’s renowned Valkeryn series will finally be concluded in the featured tale 'Revenge of the Wolfen'.</p> <p>From the bloody to the bizarre, Midnights will push you to the edge, with Greig Beck at the helm and at his frightening best.</p>";
