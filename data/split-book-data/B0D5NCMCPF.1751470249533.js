window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Mallory: Hope is a dangerous thing. It holds you close like a lover, whispering promises it never intends to keep, and just as soon as you relax into its arms, it lets you go. Sending you spinning into an abyss of nothingness. When I sent him away four years ago, he promised he would come back to me, and even as I asked him not to, I hoped that he would.</p> <p>Christopher: Life without Mallory Kent has taught me that time doesn't heal wounds. It turns them into scars. My first scar formed when I was just a child. Too young to fully understand what my mother's loss would mean for my life but old enough to remember the echo of the pain inside my empty chest. It was a unique agony. One I never expected to feel again.</p> <p>But that was before I loved her. Before I let things that had nothing to do with us cost me everything.</p> <p>It's been four years since I decided to honor her request to stay away. To move on with my life and give her a chance to move on with hers. And she might not agree, but it was more than enough time for us to try and do the impossible. The only thing our time apart has done is remind me that wherever she is, is where I'm supposed to be.</p> <p>Now I just have to make her believe it.</p>";
