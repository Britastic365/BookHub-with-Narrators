window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A dead body. </b> <b>A dark secret. </b> <b>And a sociopath who can't decide whether he'd rather kill me or kiss me.</b></p> <p>Welcome to Lionswood Prep, the world's most elite boarding school. Here, old money reigns supreme, and if you can't flaunt your weight in designer labels, you'd better get used to sitting alone. As a poor scholarship student, I know these rules better than anyone. I've perfected the art of pretending I don't envy my classmates' limitless wealth just as well as I've mastered blending into the background.</p> <p>Until the school's only other scholarship student tumbles from the fifth floor.</p> <p>Mickey Mabel's death is ruled a suicide, but I have my doubts. The only thing I am certain of is that Lionswood's golden boy, Adrian Ellis, is somehow involved. It's a wild suspicion, considering Adrian is not just Lionswood's richest student... but also one of the nicest. He's the kind of guy who buys out the bake sale and caters lunch for a grieving student body... surely, he can't be a murderer, can he?</p> <p>Most of my classmates worship the ground he walks on, but I've seen enough darkness to sense that there's more than a little of it lurking beneath that pretty smile of his.</p> <p>I shouldn't get involved, but for the first time in nearly four years, I'm done sticking to the shadows. Except exposing Adrian doesn't quite go to plan, and now, he has his sights set on me. He's determined to turn senior year into a game of cat-and-mouse, one where I'm not sure if his end goal is to kill me or possess me.</p> <p>And the longer we play, the less certain I am that I want to escape his snare.</p> <p>After all, I've got a few dark secrets of my own.</p> <p>Limerence <i>is a dark romance featuring an obsessed love interest who is unapologetically morally black. The relationship between our hero and heroine is not a healthy one and features themes of dubious consent, emotional manipulation, and other explicit content. For mature listeners.</i></p>";
