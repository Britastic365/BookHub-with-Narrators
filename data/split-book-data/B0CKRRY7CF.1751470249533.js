I was my own boss; I owned my own house—and I recently was contacted by an older sister I didn’t know I had. Everything was perfect...until tragedy struck. All the things that had come into my life were suddenly gone—except for one thing: my niece.</p> <p><b>Levi</b>: I was a confirmed bachelor. I was married to my work and committed to nothing more. No woman was going to change that. Eva is my best friend and needed a life-changing favor: marry her so she could gain custody of her niece. A marriage of convenience that would only last a year, tops. But there were stipulations we hadn’t planned on. Things got blurry—lines got crossed. I would honor my commitment...I just hope I can walk away.</p>";
