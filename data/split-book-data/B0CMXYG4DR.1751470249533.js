window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Lucia</b></p> <p>It all started with a contract signed by him, then by me, while our families watched. While my father sat silent, a man defeated, giving his daughter to the Benedetti monsters.</p> <p>I obeyed. I played my part. I signed my name and gave away my life. I became their living, breathing trophy, a constant symbol of their power over us.</p> <p>That was five years ago.</p> <p>Then came the time for him to claim me. For Salvatore Benedetti to own me.</p> <p>I had vowed vengeance. I had learned hate. And yet, nothing could have prepared me for the man who now ruled my life.</p> <p>I expected a monster, one I would destroy. But nothing is ever black or white. No one is either good or evil. For all his darkness, I saw his light. For all his evil, I saw his good. As much as he made me hate him, a passion hotter than the fires of hell burned inside me.</p> <p>I was his, and he was mine.</p> <p>My very own monster.</p> <p><b>Salvatore</b></p> <p>I owned the DeMarco Mafia princess. She belonged to me now. We had won, and they had lost. And what better way to teach a lesson than to take from them that which is most precious? Most beloved?</p> <p>I was the boy who would be king. Next in line to rule the Benedetti family. Lucia DeMarco was the spoils of war. Mine to do with as I pleased.</p> <p>It was my duty to break her. To make her life a living hell. My soul was dark, I was hell-bound. And there was no way out, not for either of us. Because the Benedetti family never lost, and in our wake, we left destruction. Itâ€™s how it had always been. How I believed it would always be.</p> <p>Until Lucia.</p>";
