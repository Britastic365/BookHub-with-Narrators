window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>They call me “The Devil.”</p> <p>Deranged and violent. Gorgeous but frightening. I’m a businessman, so when one of my debtors offers me his fiancé in exchange for a debt settled, I figure why not? The woman will be a quick sell. Repayment comes in the form of a beautiful but haunted young woman. The light in her tempts the darkness inside of me. Teases it, tortures it. I want to hurt her. I want to break her. I want to keep her. Luckily for Celia, she fails to see that there is no goodness in me. And when she attempts to draw me in with her innocence and sweet, naïve heart, I thrive to show her the cruel monster I am.</p> <p><i>This is a dark mafia romance that contains non-con/dub con, graphic violence, and sexual themes. It is not a standalone novel and ends on a cliffhanger.</i></p>";
