I've devoted my life finding her—no matter where that leads me.</p> <p>I could never have imagined it would bring me to him. A human with haunting celadon eyes and a determination that rivals my own. He's strong, brash, and gorgeous. Maybe that's why I was caught off guard when he acknowledged that I was a covert agent. It's a secret few know, and if word gets out, I'm as good as dead.</p> <p>Too much rides on my identity remaining hidden. I have no choice but to help him navigate the perilous depths of the Below—and all who reside there.</p> <p>But the lines that were once so vivid between us slowly begin to blur. We have only each other to survive and trusting him with my life is one thing. With my heart . . . that's something I can't even consider. Yet, I can't stop wondering what his lips would feel like against mine. I can't help the ache I feel to be near him.</p> <p>I never wanted to fall in love . . . but he stole my heart before I had a chance to safeguard it.</p> <p>Now fate is pulling us apart, but I intend to fight for him. For us. Even if it means my death.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
