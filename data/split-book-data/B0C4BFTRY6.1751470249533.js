window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Westin St. James was the one and only person I trusted in this world. Then, he left me. And not just left. I’m talking vanished off of the face of the Earth kind of left. But four years later, he walks into the front door of my evil father’s house like nothing ever happened.</p> <p>Even worse, my father informs me he’s my new bodyguard. But I’m no longer the naive girl he loved and dumped without a word of explanation. I’m resourceful and independent. Plus, I’ve got a mean right hook. Which I introduce him too as soon as he reintroduces himself with an infuriating smirk. And things get even crazier after that.</p> <p><i>The Rook</i> is a love and action packed stand-alone romance with roller coaster twists, jaw-dropping turns, and a heart-bursting HEA. Perfect for people who miss <i>Alias</i>, and listeners who love to boo and hiss at disappearing exes who show back up at your front door.</p>";
