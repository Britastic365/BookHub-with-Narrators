Her business associate Thomas Argeneau has some interesting traits, like an allergic reaction to the sun, excellent night vision, and not much of an appetite for food. And to top it all off, he just tried to bite her neck...but maybe that was a sign of passion. If so, she'd be happy to experience more, despite her determination not to mix business with pleasure. He's been waiting forever for a woman like her....</p> <p>Well, if not forever, at least 200 years. Inez is the most beautiful woman he's seen in centuries. Those luscious lips, seductive curves, and her elegant neck...he just couldn't resist the temptation of one little bite. Now Thomas will do anything to convince her that only an immortal like him can satisfy her all night long.</p>";
