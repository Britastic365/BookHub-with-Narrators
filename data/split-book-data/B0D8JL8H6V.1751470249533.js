window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Contains books 1–3 of The Shattered Soul series.</b></p> <p><b><i>The Fragment of Water,</i></b><b> book one</b></p> <p>Born of magic in the final days of war, Draeken's power is near absolute—until his soul shatters, leaving five fragments.</p> <p>Each possesses a single magic and a consciousness of his own. Trained by the Hauntress, they secretly quell threats throughout the kingdoms, and their mastery grows with every passing age. But their time of unity has come, for a dangerous new foe has arrived.</p> <p>Long thought extinct, the ancient race of krey has returned to Lumineia, and they seek dominion over what they had lost. With an Eternal at his side, the fragment of Water is sent north in search of their lair. But in the ruins of an abandoned temple, he will discover a darker truth.</p> <p>Kept secret since the Dawn of Magic, the Order of Ancients has members hidden among thieves, assassins, and even kings. After a millennia of waiting they rise... from anonymity to war.</p> <p><b><i>The Fragment of Shadow, </i></b><b>book two</b></p> <p>The fragments of Draeken have protected Lumineia for ages but never faced such a foe.</p> <p>Serak, the Father of Guardians, has plotted for thousands of years, studying them in secret, even inciting conflicts to measure their power. Now allied with Wylyn, leader of the invading krey, he is even more dangerous, yet his true purpose is a mystery.</p> <p>The fragment of Shadow is sent in search of Wylyn's son. Intelligent and tactical, Relgor thinks himself a master of all and wants the fragments for his own gain. Unfortunately for him, Shadow possesses a gift for evasion and a desire for mischief. With the last guild assassin as a reluctant ally, Shadow is ready to hunt, for the most delightful prey is also the most deadly.</p> <p><b><i>The Fragment of Light,</i></b><b> book three</b></p> <p>One shattered soul. Five fragments of power.</p> <p>The tide of war continues to rise, and the fragments of Draeken have parted to fight the expanding threats. While the other fragments hunt the remaining outlanders, Light dons the persona of Serak, head of the Order of Ancients, and infiltrates their ranks to find the missing dark elf queen. But wearing Serak's face will not hide Light's nature, and his innocence could very well be their undoing.</p> <p>Highly impulsive and easily distracted, Light must rely on Willow to keep him in check. The dark elf soldier is cunning and focused, yet it is her tattoos that bring her renown. They are tools and weapons inscribed on her flesh, ink to be wielded. The trail for the queen will take them from underground cities to snowy peaks, and by the time the dust settles, there will be a trail of chaos through the Order.</p> <p>The fragment of Light has been unleashed.</p>";
