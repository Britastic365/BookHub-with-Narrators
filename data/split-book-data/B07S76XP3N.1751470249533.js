window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Three dragon shifters and a fierce heroine in a fast-paced young adult adventure...</p> <p>Lila McCarty used to see dragons.</p> <p>That was before they killed her mother, before she told everyone what happened and people stamped the “crazy” label on her head. Now, as a senior in high school, she has no time for dragon legends or the tourists who putter around her lighthouse. She just wants to graduate and get the hell out.</p> <p>But when 12 of Lila’s classmates, including her best friend, mysteriously vanish during the town’s dragon festivities, she tracks down the three mysterious guys who seem to know more than they let on. They’re sexy and infuriatingly charming, though that has nothing to do with why she’s enlisting their help.</p> <p>It turns out Lila wasn’t crazy. Dragons are real. Not only that, the three dragon shifters have answers: her past, her role in their hidden world. It’s Lila’s duty to save her friends, whether she likes it or not.</p> <p>When her classmates start turning up dead, she’s on a race against the clock - find the killer, or lose them all.</p>";
