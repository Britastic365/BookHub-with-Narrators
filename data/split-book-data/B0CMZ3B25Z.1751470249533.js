window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The 21st century is quite the horrifying eye-opener for a Vampyre warrior who's been in a magical coma for a thousand years.</p> <p>The Vampyre in question would be me. I’m so damned confused by the modern world, and getting electrocuted for being misogynistic—whatever that means—is getting old.</p> <p>It’s insanity. Apparently, there’s a species called Karens running in the wild. The Tube of You and the Book of the Faces are alarming. From what I understand, the Karens gather there. I much prefer homing pigeons to the small rectangular metal box the undead of today seem to favor. Although, I am enamored with the horseless metal chariots.</p> <p>The good old days of skin peeling and ripping out entrails are over. So be it. I’ll fit in. Getting set aflame sucks.</p> <p>Plus, there’s a beautiful blonde who’s in my every waking thought. She might not know it yet, but we’re destined to be. Although, every time I cop a feel, I get my nards kneed up into my esophagus. My wooing skills might be a little rusty....</p> <p>Armed with the magic word, <i>please</i>, and the challenge of using my words instead of my sword, I shall succeed.</p> <p>I’m fierce.</p> <p>I’m fabulous.</p> <p>And I’m in love.</p>";
