window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In the dystopian realm of The Order, society is eternally divided between the privileged Untouchables and the struggling Unfortunates.</b></p> <p>The Untouchables, draped in opulence and power, govern the city with an iron fist, casting long shadows over the impoverished Unfortunates who toil beneath in the murky depths of the working class.</p> <p>As the ruling elite revel in excess and luxury, the Unfortunates navigate a world stacked against them, grappling with meager resources and restricted opportunities. The social chasm widens daily as the Untouchables tighten their grip on wealth and influence, leaving the Unfortunates to navigate the shadows cast upon their lives.</p> <p>The Order Series follows the intertwining fates of two sworn enemiesâ€”one an ambitious Untouchable seeking to challenge the system from within, struggling to cope as the lies of her society unfold in front of her; the other an Unfortunate yearning for a chance to seek vengeance on any and every Untouchable in his path. Their stories unfold against a backdrop of intrigue, rebellion, and the unyielding determination to break free from the oppressive shackles of a society defined by its merciless class divisions.</p> <p>The question is, can free will exist in a society this divided?</p>";
