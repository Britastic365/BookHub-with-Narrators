window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>On Hallowe'en night, Mathilda Honeycutt finds out she's a SuperWitch. Not the modern, hippie kind...the real, wand-wielding, pixie-dust kind. After a life devoted to retail and coffee drinks, Mathilda is thrown into the secret world of witches, werewolves, vampires, faeries, you name it, it exists!</p> <p>As Mathilda discovers her magic, she also discovers she's prophesied to save the world. The problem is, she'd rather spend her time on online auctions bidding on fabulous designer shoes.</p> <p>Now, she's got to save the world, run her coffee house and figure out what's going on with the silent, watchful (but yummy) Sebastian Wilding and brainy, charismatic (and hot) Dr. Aidan Seymour.</p> <p>Making matters worse, her nemesis is a powerful witch who doesn't mind fighting dirty.</p> <p>Will Mathilda be able to save the world while still being perfectly accessorized? And how is she going to pick between Luscious Sebastian and Dreamy Aidan?</p> <p>Lastly, will she ever get the hang of riding around on a broom?</p>";
