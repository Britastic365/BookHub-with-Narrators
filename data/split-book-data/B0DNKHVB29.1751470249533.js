window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> Bestselling author Kristen Proby comes </b><b><i>When We Break</i></b><b>, a small-town, cowboy, heroine-in-danger romance, set in Bitterroot Valley!</b></p> <p><b>Beckett</b></p> <p>I’ve seen the gorgeous redhead with the big black dog that never leaves her side around town. She’s impossible to miss with that lush red hair and perfect green eyes. But it’s when she opens her plump lips and the sound of Ireland comes out of her kissable mouth that I know I’m a goner. I know she’s the one for me and I’ll do whatever it takes to make Skyla Gallagher mine. I can be a patient man and all I want in the world is to worship every bit of her, inside and out.</p> <p><b>Skyla</b></p> <p>I moved to the lovely town of Bitterroot Valley, Montana, because I needed a safe place. I left my life in New York as a prima ballerina after an injury that I never fully healed from, and to escape the obsession of a madman. I adore this new community, but I must admit that Beckett Blackwell is the very best part. I love his kindness, his patience, and his thoughtfulness. But most of all, I can’t get enough of the way he worships my body, and then does everything he can to pamper me afterwards. Beckett is a drug that I’ve become addicted to. But will my stalker find me in Montana, ruining everything we’ve started together, before we have had our chance at forever?</p>";
