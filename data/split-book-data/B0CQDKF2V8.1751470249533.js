window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A book that helps listeners define what makes them tick in the bedroom, resulting in more love, passion, and intimacy with their partners—plus better sex!</b></p> <p>When it comes to sex, many of us have been sold on the idea that certain techniques and tools are surefire turn-ons. If those techniques don't work, and we don't connect with our partners or our own pleasure, then something is inherently wrong with us. But sexologist Jaiya has identified five erotic types—Energetic, Sensual, Sexual, Kinky, and Shapeshifter—that, like Gary Chapman's <i>The 5 Love Languages</i>, empower people with the understanding that we are each erotically gifted and that our differences are our strengths. Jaiya's framework will help listeners bridge the sexual incompatibility gap, become masters of their own sexual desire, and experience the deeper connection and sexual satisfaction that they crave.</p> <p>Based on Miss Jaiya's wildly popular Erotic Blueprint Quiz, <i>Your Blueprint for Pleasure</i> will help listeners explore and find themselves among the five erotic types identified in this program. Fans of <i>Come As You Are, The Erotic Mind</i>, or other books on human sexuality and how to have sex will find much to appreciate in this empowering intimacy book.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
