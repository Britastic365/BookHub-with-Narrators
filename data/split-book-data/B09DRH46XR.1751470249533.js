window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>New York Times</i> and <i>USA Today</i> best-selling author Kristen Ashley brings a new novel in her River Rain series....</p> <p>From a very young age, Chloe Pierce was trained to look after the ones she loved. And she was trained by the best. But when the man who looked after her was no longer there, Chloe is cast adrift - just as the very foundation of her life crumbled to pieces.</p> <p>Then she runs into tall, lanky, unpretentious Judge Oakley, her exact opposite. She shops. He hikes. She drinks pink ladies. He drinks beer. She’s a city girl. He’s a mountain guy.</p> <p>Obviously, this means they have a blowout fight upon meeting. Their second encounter doesn’t go a lot better.</p> <p>Judge is loving the challenge. Chloe is everything he doesn’t want in a woman, but he can’t stop finding ways to spend time with her. He knows she’s dealing with loss and change.</p> <p>He just doesn’t know how deep that goes. Or how ingrained it is for Chloe to care for those who have a place in her heart, how hard it will be to trust anyone to look after her...and how much harder it is when it’s his turn.</p>";
