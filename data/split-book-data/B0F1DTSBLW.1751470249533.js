One too lazy to get off his throne and go look for his mate. Instead, he’s requesting that all unmated females from each of the four kingdoms come to <i>him</i>. You know, because that’s so much easier.<br> <br> Much to my dismay, I’m forced to go to Solaris and what I hope will be a quick trip, turns into something else entirely.<br> <br> King Theo is <i>supposedly</i> my mate. Just my freaking luck.<br> <br> Yet, there’s something off with our bond. No, with <i>him</i>. I don’t know what it is and I’m not certain what to do, but I’m sure the hell going to find out. Because there’s one thing that I know for sure…<br> <br> I won’t be used as anyone’s pawn. Not even for a mate.<br> <br> <i>This is the second standalone novel written within the Wolves of Lunara series. If you love wolf shifters, romantic fantasy, gods, fated mates, reincarnation, and so much more, then you don't want to miss this one!</i></p>";
