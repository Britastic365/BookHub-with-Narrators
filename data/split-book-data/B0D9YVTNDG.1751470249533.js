window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Agent Bradly \"Wolfe\" Tucker has one case he cannot solve: six murdered women and a cold trail leading nowhere. When bodies with an eerily similar MO show up in Philadelphia, he volunteers to assist with the case. He figures he will spend a few days in Philly, hand the case off, and head back to his life in Seattle. But everything changes when he stops at a local bar, looks across the room, and sees her.</p> <p>Agent Leda Bailey has had a bad week. She has three dead women and no trail to follow. The clues don't add up, and nothing makes sense. So, she heads to her favorite bar to forget about the case for a few hours. When he offers to buy her a drink, she thinks this just might be the distraction she needs. The encounter turns into a weekend. Leda thinks this might be something so much more, but can she really let down her guard enough to let him in? He wasn't supposed to fall for her. He wasn't supposed to stay. But he loses himself every time he looks into her dark eyes.</p> <p>He was Wolfe to his former SEAL team, Agent Tucker to FBI colleagues, and Tuc to close friends. But he wants to be someone else for her. Will she let him into her carefully guarded world? Or will she run when she realizes how damaged he really is? Friends tease him about his protector complex. They might be right. Because he would do anything to keep Leda safe. Even give her his heart.</p> <p>Leda Bailey accepted long ago that no one will see beyond her disability. When she meets Tuc, Leda realizes she wants more than just a one-night stand. But how does she let him behind the walls that keep her safe? Will she lose herself if she lets him in? Or is opening her heart to Tuc the key to finally being truly safe?</p> <p>The Omega Series is intended for mature audiences over the age of 18. Parental guidance and caution are suggested due to possible triggering situations, including but not limited to strong language, alcohol consumption, violence, sexual situations, and depictions of trauma.</p>";
