window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The King of Hell owns me. Mind, body, and eternal soul.</b> </p> <p>The devil’s in the details, and I shouldn’t be surprised to find hell in Las Vegas. Luke doesn’t care that I can’t remember a thing about the deal we made on the night of my bachelorette party. All he cares is that I promised my love, my life, and my obedience to him for all eternity.</p> <p>Obedience? </p> <p>Not my style. I’m not looking to be owned by any man. </p> <p>To make matters worse, I was supposed to be marrying another. But Adam can’t stand against Luke’s strength. I’m Luke’s prisoner. And his lover, the Persephone to his Hades. And I can’t resist his wicked charms and sinfully good looks. </p> <p>With the mark of the beast on me and an army of Versace-clad demons knocking down my door, my options for freedom aren't just running out, they’re long gone. Only Luke can keep me safe. And only if I play by his rules. </p> <p>The King of Sin needs a queen. If I want to survive, I don’t have any choice but to give the devil his due. </p>";
