Or in wayward love, the drama is sprinkled in between passionate lovemaking’.”<br> <br> <b><i>“That sounds more like one of them novels you like to read.”</i></b><br> <br> “No. Ours is too hilly to be a traditional romance story.”<br> <br> And it is. Journey the conclusion to Love Belvin’s riveting “Wayward Love” series, and see how errant the path to Isaak and Kennedi’s happily ever after is. What is a perfect love story? Does it not include disappointment, betrayal, distractions, guilt, and anger?<br> <br> Just how much can these two take before they decide the victory of love isn’t worth the pain?</p> <p><b>Publisher’s Note:</b> This is the final installment of a three book series. It contains expletive language, and sexual content. If you do not wish to have these elements in your reads, this is not the venture for you.</p>";
