Something that kills like a werewolf, but displays those kills publicly–as if taunting the authorities.<br> <br> Thanks to my spiffy new agreement with the police, it’s my job to figure out just what that something is.<br> <br> But whoever is hunting the good citizens of Durham is also taunting me.<br> <br> When my investigation takes me to the local werewolf pack–and the overprotective male in charge–I know I’m in trouble.<br> <br> Can I solve these murders without losing my freedom...or my life?<br> <br> Or will the creature make me regret ever thinking I was strong enough to be out in the world alone?<br> <br> If you like K.F Breene, Ilona Andrews, Patricia Briggs, Faith Hunter, Laurell K. Hamilton, Jennifer Estep, Shannon Mayer, Kim Harrison, and Dannika Dark, you’ll love this series. <br> <br> Listen to it now.</p>";
