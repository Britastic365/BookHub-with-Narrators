window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Rafael</b></p> <p>As the president of the Devil's Mayhem MC, I make the hard decisions so my men don't have to. They're my family, but I have to keep myself separate from them. After I failed my own family, I can't risk failing them too.</p> <p>A visit from the sheriff changes everything. Suddenly I find myself raising my estranged sister's six-month-old son and completely out of my depth. I desperately need help, and that comes in the form of Omari, who quickly becomes more than a manny to me.</p> <p><b>Omari</b></p> <p>Things aren't going so well for me. I lost my office job and ended up having to crash at my best friend's house. But that ends after a horrible incident involving my best friend's boyfriend trying to proposition me. Answering a help wanted ad for a nanny position to get on my feet was not ideal, especially when the man who needed the help was the scary president of the motorcycle club I had a run-in with a few months back. But the pay is good, and I can't possibly leave this sweet baby alone with his uncle, who has little regard for him. Raf is hardly home anyway, so we'll just stay out of each other's way.</p> <p>But Raf isn't the scary biker I assumed he was. I want to peel back his prickly layers to get to the soft middle I only catch glimpses of. But would someone that looks like him be interested in a chubby guy like me?</p>";
