Some of them wear collars.</b></p> <p><i>A Dog’s Purpose</i> meets <i>The Happy Ever After Playlist</i> in this charming, pitch-perfect take on relationships as seen through the eyes of a wise pug named Doug, who is determined to play cupid to fix his owner’s love life with his own four paws.</p> <p>Doug wants his rescuer, Julie, to be happy. He is loyal and loves her unconditionally - two things that can’t be said about Julie’s married boss and lover, Luke. Yet Julie is reluctant to break up, afraid to end up like her eccentric cat-owning neighbor. It’s a prospect that horrifies Doug, too.</p> <p>Newly divorced Tom, on the other hand, is perfect for Julie. Everyone can see it - except for Julie and Tom. Doug is confident that with his help they will get over their initial animosity toward each other.</p> <p>As Doug humorously navigates the quirks of human relationships, he knows he can’t give up on Julie - after all, being a “rescue” works both ways.</p>";
