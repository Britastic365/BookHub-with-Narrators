Every transgression, an indecent pleasure. Every woman, a conquest. And none is more challenging than his new personal assistant, Gabrielle Caron. She's defiant, alluring, and a mystery Pascal can't wait to solve.</p> <p>A former family servant and daughter of the head maid, Gabrielle's returned as suddenly as she left eight years ago. No longer an awkward teen, the ethereal young beauty has amassed a wealth of resolve. She'll need it. In hire to the devilishly charming scion, she's come back for one reason only. And she dare not whisper why.</p> <p>But as the nights grow more intimate at the Dumont <i>maison</i>, Gabrielle realizes that the last man she believed in is the one man she can trust with her secrets. For Pascal, falling in love means more than his own redemption. It could mean saving Gabrielle's very life as they confront a dark and scandalous past...together.</p>";
