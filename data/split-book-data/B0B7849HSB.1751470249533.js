window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>Now that this siren has legs and a tail, she’s going to use them....</i></b><b> For good</b><b><i> and </i></b><b>bad, of course!</b></p> <p>There’s no escaping this Princess of Atlantis or the coming storm!</p> <p><i>Save the world first, get some later. Being the somewhat-good guy is exhausting sometimes.</i></p> <p>The Ancients’ world is under attack. The lips delivering this unexpected news to me are even more unexpected. They belong to Lokene, the charming and mischievous young man I fell in love with before my beloved Atlantis sank into the sea. The Ancients have sent him to request my aid because he’s my mate, and they think I will listen to him. Did I mention Lokene is an Ancient? Oh, and he has the ability to give me legs, and take them away, at will. I swear he’s enjoying this. If I could train my great white shark, Sheba, I’d be teaching her to nip his butt.</p> <p>Look, these new legs are great, but I need to save the world right now…not be distracted by the thought of all the fun times this body and my five mates could have together.</p> <p>On top of that, I’m still on a seek-and-destroy mission in the human world for those under the soul-destroying power of the Lure. As if I didn’t have enough on my plate, miners continue to destroy the ocean. Their actions are taking them closer and closer to the heart of Atlantis, and if the humans find it, the power they could unleash would rip the world apart. I’m hoping that Eason, Storm, Kye, and Fynn can help me stop them before it’s too late.</p> <p>Last, but certainly not least, the floor of the ocean is angry, preparing to lash out. I’m not sure my wind and water abilities are strong enough to stop it from destroying entire cities and claiming countless lives. Let’s hope I hear the call again soon. I really need to relieve some stress.</p> <p>All these sexy mates are distracting…but I have two worlds to save. And legs. <i>I have legs now, too.</i></p>";
