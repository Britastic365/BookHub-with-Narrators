window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Gareth Harkness is a supernatural predator born to hunt his natural enemy—vampires. Hunting isn’t his job, it’s his calling, one that doesn’t leave a lot of time for a normal life. He’s got a mission instead of a mortgage, and the only woman in his life is the nameless beauty who haunts his dreams.</p> <p>Kyra Robinson is too pragmatic to believe in magic, monsters, or things that go bump in the night. She’s forced to change her attitude when a random encounter at her Vancouver nightclub puts her in the sights of a vampire who wants her for his own.</p> <p>Kyra is desired by two men, the hunter, and the killer. After a lifetime of protecting herself, she’ll have to put her heart, and her life, in the hands of a man just as dangerous as the creature hunting her.</p> <p>**Publisher’s Note–This book was previously released as Whispers in the Dark. It has been revised and updated.</p>";
