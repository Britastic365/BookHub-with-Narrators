window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Houston, this was not part of the plan. Not even a little tiny bit. He's not my fated mate, yet here I am, pregnant regardless.</b></p> <p><b>Leigh</b></p> <p>It's not supposed to be possible, but I guess when your BFF is some sort of unicorn wolf with special powers, things tend to get a bit wonky. But that's not really the point. The point is I'm super duper for sure pregnant, and he's pissed off, growly, and grumpy as hell.</p> <p>Oh, and he found out by accident. While I was telling his best friend. And puking loudly. Huzzah for morning sickness, yo.</p> <p>And... he didn't seem thrilled. Not loving the trajectory here. But I'll protect my tiny, perfect Petal. Even from her own father if I have to.</p> <p><b>Gael</b></p> <p>Am I still breathing? I'm not really sure because a one-night stand isn't supposed to come with these sorts of consequences. I mean, sure, if we were human. But wolves? It's not that easy. There are signs.</p> <p>Despite the utter lack of a starter pistol announcing that we were a go, the four pregnancy tests laid out on her bathroom counter don't lie. I'm going to be a dad. <i> </i>Pretty sure my face is about to melt off with the shock.</p> <p>She and I are like oil and water. Fire and gasoline? Yeah, that one. It's not because I don't like her. Hell, I can't stop thinking about her. The problem is she knows how to push every last one of my buttons, and she's determined to slam the door in my face.</p> <p>But I'm not the kind of guy to take no for an answer, not when the woman I'm crazy about and my baby are on the line. We might not have mate signs—yet<i>—</i>but I know she's the one for me. Now, I just have to prove that I can be the one for her, too.</p> <p>That can't be too difficult, right?</p> <p><i>Dive into this steamy wolf-shifter romance if you love fated mates (but not insta-love), a surprise baby, a cinnamon roll hero, supportive girl besties, with just a dash of grumpy/sunshine.</i></p> <p><i>This new paranormal romance from April L. Moon is perfect for fans of Shannon Mayer and Jaymin Eve. The first book contains a HEA for our main couple. The story arc spans multiple books, but each one contains a new couple and a new romance while still bringing in familiar faces until our world's problems are solved.</i></p>";
