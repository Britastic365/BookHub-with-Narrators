window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>He was the darkness to my light, a twisted forbidden fruit. </b><br> <br> Stalker. Sinner. Dominator. He created reality from dark and sensual nightmares. Yet I craved them. And I hungered for him. <br> <br> Xander Blackwell was all things dangerous and possessive, requiring me to surrender. Demanding I submit to every brutal command. While the passion was savagely intense, his discipline without remorse, his touch and uncontrollable sadistic desire peeled away every layer, exposing the wanton and subversive woman within. <br> <br> We were perfect for each other, a match made in...<br> <br> The game was real. <br> <br> There was no question, no choice. Now, I belonged to him. <br> <br> <i>Publisher's Note: Sinner </i>is the first in the <i>Legacy of Kings Series </i>but can be listened to as a standalone. It includes spankings and rough, intense sexual scenes. If such material offends you, please don't buy this book.</p>";
