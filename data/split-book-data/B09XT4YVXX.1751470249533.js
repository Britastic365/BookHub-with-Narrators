window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Living on an island plagued by magic and mythical monsters isn’t a fairy tale...it’s a nightmare.</b></p> <p>After Keelynn witnesses her sister's murder at the hands of the legendary Gancanagh, an immortal creature who seduces women and kills them with a cursed kiss, she realizes there’s nothing she wouldn't do to get her back. With the help of a vengeful witch, she’s given everything she needs to resurrect the person she loves most. </p> <p>But first, she must slay the Gancanagh.</p> <p>Tadhg, a devilishly handsome half-fae who has no patience for high society—or propriety—would rather spend his time in the company of loose women and dark creatures than help a human kill one of his own.</p> <p>That is until Keelynn makes him an offer he can’t refuse.</p> <p>Together, they embark on a cross-country curse-breaking mission that promises life but ends in death.</p>";
