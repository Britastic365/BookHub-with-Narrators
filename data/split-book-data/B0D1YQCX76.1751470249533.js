window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>I have spent my entire life in the basement of my father's church.</b></p> <p>My sadistic mother and god-fearing father believe I have the devil inside of me because I heal after their abuse. I accepted long ago I would die in the very place I'd been born without ever feeling the sun on my skin.</p> <p>Then, one day, my mother took me from my father's religious cult in the wake of his death. Nearly a week later, and after countless hours with her boyfriend Jed's creepy remarks, I find myself in Washington State.</p> <p>I had only ever interacted with my parents and now Jed, so you can imagine my surprise when I ran smack dab into possibly the most handsome man in the world. He's not alone, though. Intriguing and handsome men are popping up everywhere in my life.</p> <p>Except I shouldn't be focusing on that. I should be preparing for my mother's cruel hits. Preparing to run the minute I turn eighteen. Preparing to hide from Jed's leering comments and uncomfortable stares.</p> <p>One interaction with this man and I feel like my entire life has been altered. Five days until I turn eighteen. Five days until my mother realizes what happens when you keep a bird cooped up for too long, only to open its cage. Five days until I am out of here.</p> <p>My problem? Everything inside of me tells me that those intriguing men are mine… and they seem to think the same.</p> <p><i>This is a slow/medium burn fantasy reverse harem that features a naive but strong MFC with a troubled past and a secret about what she really is. Come meet Maya and her protective and possessive dragon shifters!</i></p> <p><i>Book one in the Reborn series. Intended for mature listeners.</i></p>";
