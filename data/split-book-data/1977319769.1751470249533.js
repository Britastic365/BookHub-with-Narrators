But then, I also thought Norse gods were make-believe too. </p> <p>They're not. </p> <p>Five of them are coming for me. They claim I will only survive if I surrender to them, body and soul. But they don't realize it's about so much more than carnal servitude. I am so much more than they could ever suspect. So much more than even I knew. </p> <p>I am the only one who can stop Ragnarök from covering the world in ice and darkness. The only one who can save gods and men alike from annihilation.
