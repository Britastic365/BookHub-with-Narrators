window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Growing up in a small town isn't easy, especially when you're the daughter of a local cult leader. Ten years ago, Eden Collins left Clear Springs, Montana, and never once looked back. But when the bodies of murdered young women surface, their corpses violated and marked with tattoos worn by her mother's followers, Eden, now an FBI agent, can't turn a blind eye. To catch the killer, she's going to have to return to the fold. </p> <p>Sheriff Zach Owens isn't comfortable putting Eden in danger, even if she is an elite agent. And he certainly wasn't expecting to be so attracted to her. As calm and cool as she appears, he knows this can't be a happy homecoming. Zach wants to protect her - from her mother, the cult, and the evil that lurks behind its locked gates. But Eden is his only key to the tight-lipped group, and she may just be closer to the killer than either one of them suspects... </p>";
