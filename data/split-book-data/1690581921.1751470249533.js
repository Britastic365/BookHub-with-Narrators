It was the first mistake I ever made in our friendship. Giving her my heart and hoping she felt the same way were my second and third. </p> <p>That night she broke me, ripped my heart out of my chest and stomped on it. Anyone else would’ve hated her for it, but it only made me value her more - and realize that I would do anything I could to keep her in my life even if it was only as a friend and nothing more. </p> <p>As a permanent resident of the friend zone, I promised myself that I would never cross that line again no matter how badly I wanted to - and I wanted to badly. </p> <p>Every time she smiled at me, licked her pink lips, or flashed her doe eyes my way, I came a little closer to breaking the rules again...but I didn’t. I couldn’t do that to us...until one night when we decided to break the rules together. </p> <p>One Earth-shattering night together and I knew nothing would ever be the same. </p> <p>Friends, or lovers? I don’t know what we are anymore. The rules no longer apply to us. </p> <p>Now the only question is...can we fix what we had before it’s too late, or is our friendship over for good? And all because of one single kiss?</p>";
