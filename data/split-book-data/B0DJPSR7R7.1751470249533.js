window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I don’t like my new boss. Not at all.</p> <p>London Ambrose is a spoiled billionaire’s daughter. And now she’s the new co-owner of the Seattle football team, but that doesn’t mean that she knows diddly squat about football. There’s nothing I hate more than having someone micromanaging me, shadowing my every move, and giving me their two cents on every little thing, as I coach my defensive line. I don’t care about new team jerseys and branding or answering her million and one questions about how I do my job. But I can’t help but come to her defense when an old flame shows up and starts harassing her. I’m a Montgomery. We don’t let anyone mess with women.</p> <p>Now, I’m suddenly in a fake relationship, pretending to date the gorgeous billionaire and learning so many surprising things about this captivating woman that I just can’t seem to stay away from her.</p> <p>When the lines between our fake relationship and real relationship blur, and my initial distaste for her turns into desire, I find myself coaching the most important game of my life—do I let my guard down or do I let London Ambrose walk away forever?</p>";
