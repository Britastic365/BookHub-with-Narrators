Now it's time to show the kingdom of Embermere who I am.</p> <p>A rebellion has been gathering force against the queen. It needs only a spark to gain momentum. It needs me: the secret heir.</p> <p>First, I must survive the Wilds—savage, brutal, and even more dangerous than the queen herself. No one enters its ancient, slithering forests unless they have no better choice.</p> <p>Joined by dragon-shifter Xeno, dragonling Saffron, goblin Pru, and fellow fae-trial contenders, I'm not alone. But every shadow in the Wilds crawls with horrible, giant monsters. Out here, we're no longer just trained warriors. We're prey.</p> <p>It's more important than ever that I unearth the power that simmers in my veins so I can return to the palace and claim my royal birthright.</p> <p>I once thought the drake Rush Vega was my ally. Even worse, I believed him to be my mate.</p> <p>But then he committed the ultimate betrayal. He broke what can never be mended. Once the queen's spy, forever my enemy.</p> <p>Whatever it takes, whomever I must fight, I'll end her wicked games and free her subjects.</p> <p>The mirror world might not have been my home to start, but I'm not quitting until I save it.</p> <p><i>This</i> <i>is a slow-burn fantasy romance with lots of adventurous action and some graphic violence and sexuality. </i>Fae Exile<i> is the third book in the Royals of Embermere</i> <i>series, which is best listened to in order and will conclude with a happily-ever-after.</i></p>";
