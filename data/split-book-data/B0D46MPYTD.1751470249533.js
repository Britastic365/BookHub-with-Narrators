window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the story \"<b>The Muse</b>,\" celebrated novelist Mark Davis unexpectedly returns from his travels, surprising his wife and compelling her to discreetly send their houseguest, Victor, out of their home to avoid exposing their secret affair. Upon Mark's arrival, Victor is summoned for a meeting where discussions of fate, destiny, and a mysterious journal Mark refers to as the Muse, unfold.<br> <br> As Victor humors the ramblings of an eccentric man, his curiosity is piqued. However, fascination soon morphs into fear as Mark's tales eerily mirror Victor's clandestine life, leading Victor to question whether Mark is aware of his affair with Kim. The journal's peculiar allure seems to exert an eerie influence on Mark, drawing him further into a whirlwind of compulsive writing. The transformation is so striking that Victor finds himself questioning Mark's sanity.</p>";
