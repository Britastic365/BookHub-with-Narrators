window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Life is a b*tch. Keeps screwing me over, and I take blow after blow, sucking it up, giving her the finger. Don't get me wrong: I love women. Especially one woman - Madeline. She's gorgeous, she's sexy, she's goddamn perfect. Plus - minor detail - she has a boyfriend already. </p> <p>Not that she'd want anything to do with the likes of me. Apprentice tattoo artist, former homeless person, covered in ink, without a penny to my name. And sort of cursed. I mean, I'd be lucky to run into a girl, any girl, on my way in and out of hospitals with the way life has been knocking me about lately. </p> <p>But I'm not lucky. Never was. Doesn't look like that's gonna change any day soon, either. </p> <p>Until the day the girl of my dreams literally runs into me. With her car. </p> <p>Life hates me, and if this isn't a clue, then I don't know what is. </p> <p>Stand-alone novel. No cliff-hanger. </p> <p>Warning: This book contains graphic language, sex, and violence. Mature listeners only. Not intended for young listeners. </p>";
