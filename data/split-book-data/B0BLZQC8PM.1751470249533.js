window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Kaya Reynolds is a distraction, a rage-inducing pain in the butt, and an absolute magnet for trouble. But when you're a Rogues agent, you don't get to pick your assignments. Unfortunately, you don't get to decline them either. And that's how I ended up fake engaged to the most infuriating woman I've ever met.</p> <p>The Rogues Division is a top-secret, highly-classified, \"I'd tell you but I'd have to kill you\" kind of organization. The kind of organization the government pretends not to love having at its disposal.</p> <p>Kaya Reynolds is our latest asset. If I want to bring down the man who killed my fiancé, I've got to keep her safe. Thing is, the last time I saw her, she kissed the hell out of me...because she was being chased by his goons and she needed a distraction. But something sparked between us—something I have no business thinking about day and night. Especially when we're only pretending to like each other. Aren't we? Yes we are!</p> <p>This marriage is just for show. I refuse to be tempted by my curvy assignment's soft satin lips, dark mischievous eyes, or the way she looks at me. Even when we're not playing our roles....But nope, NOPE! I lost someone I loved once. And I'm not letting anybody else into my heart. I'm not going there with the woman I'm only pretending to love. It's all about staying in control. And I won't let her tempt me into losing mine.</p>";
