window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I am not supposed to exist—my parents murdered for their forbidden union. I’m a creature born of light and dark, of Heaven and Hell, and it's up to me to hold these fragile worlds together. And I’m back here, where I never thought I’d be, surrounded by devastatingly handsome males who’d give their lives for me. And all I want to do is go home, back to earth, but the balance has been threatened and I’m the only one who can set it right. </p> <p>Who’d have thought an aberration like me would be the chosen one? I must learn to control my unruly powers so we can fight our enemies and uphold the scales...only everything in us is trying to pull us apart. I need my mates to win this battle, and my heart wants them for completely different reasons, but will we succeed or will the balance be shattered forever?</p>";
