It’s just your ovaries talking.</li> <li>Rule 4 - Don’t let him hold your hand. While we’re at it, no hugs, no kisses on the cheek...just no physical contact in general. That only leads to remembering better times.</li> </ul> <p>The last one is the most important...</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Rule 5 - When you find yourself needing someone’s help and you’re tired of always asking your family, don’t let him be the one who’s there for you. </li> </ul> <p>Because all those good qualities of his will suck you right back in and you’ll have no chance of fighting your feelings, especially now that he’s ready to be a father to your daughter.</p>";
