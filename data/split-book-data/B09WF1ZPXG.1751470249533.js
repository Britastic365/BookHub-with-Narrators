window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>I always imagined Death's final kiss would be cold. It wasn't.</b> </p> <p>Four years later, I can still remember the exact shade of his skin: a blue so pale it looked like moonlight. I dream of his touch. Mostly, I paint the man under the heavy cowl, including those perfect lips which ruined mine for anyone else. </p> <p>I'm obsessed with him. </p> <p>The doctors say he's nothing more than a hallucination caused by a mixture of head trauma and emergency pain medications. I think he's a really sexy figment of my imagination. I mean, who besides an artist would dream up the Grim Reaper for their hero? </p> <p>Now, something's changed and my drawings are taking on a life of their own. As if college wasn't hard enough, trying to keep this a secret is going to be impossible. Keeping my sanity might be worse. And that's not the worst of my problems. </p> <p><b>Death is back. </b><br> <b>He wants another kiss. </b><br> <b>And he's not alone.</b> </p> <p><b><i>The Kiss of Death</i></b> is a 156,000 word, full-length novel with no cliff-hanger ending. This series includes multiple love interests, some M/M themes, and graphic scenes of sex, violence, and language. </p> <p><b>Be warned:</b> Everything you thought you knew about the world, religion, and death will be pulled apart, twisted around, and put back together in ways you will not expect.</p>";
