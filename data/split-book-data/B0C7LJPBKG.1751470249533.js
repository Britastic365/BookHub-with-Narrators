window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From cult-favorite writing duo Kit Rocha comes a fiery novel set in a lush fantasy world brimming with ancient magic, dangerous secrets, and erotic connections.</b></p> <p>For three thousand years, an ancient dragon god has protected the borders of the Sheltered Lands. In return, he makes only one demand: every one hundred years, the mortal ruler must send their heir to serve as his consort…for as long as they can survive.</p> <p>Sachielle of House Roquebarre is the thirty-first consort to be sacrificed to the monster who guards the mountain passes. She is young, beautiful—and she has three secrets.</p> <p>First: she’s a disposable orphan trained in seduction.</p> <p>Second: her handmaid, Zanya, is an assassin and the only person she has ever loved.</p> <p>Third—and most dangerous: she’s cursed. Sachi and Zanya have five weeks to murder the Dragon in his bed. If they fail, the mortal king’s curse will steal not just Sachi’s life, but her very soul.</p> <p>The Dragon has only one secret: he is nothing like what they have been told. And he will do whatever it takes to possess them both.</p>";
