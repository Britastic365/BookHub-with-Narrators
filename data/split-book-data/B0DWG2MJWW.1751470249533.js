I guess we’re all just scrambling to put on our poker faces.</p> <p>Keeping my hands off of Milo is hard enough thanks to his lickable dimple, flirty smiles, and virgin skin. But I swear this has to be a test. Why else would Hero insist that his son come to live with me? And why is it so hard for Milo to just keep his clothes on already?</p> <p>If I can't keep my hands off of him I could lose my friends, our club, even the tattoo shop I love more than anything. Given the stakes, it should be easy.</p> <p>Right, and a Prince Albert just pinches a little…</p> <p><i>Virgin skin is a best friend’s (adult) son romance with a side of roommates-to-lovers, some forced proximity, a “stuck in the dryer” moment, and a whole lot of tension between two guys who just can’t keep their eyes and hands off of each other, no matter how much they try.</i></p>";
