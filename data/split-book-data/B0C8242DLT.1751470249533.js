In what should have been a typical night, they coax a bevy of nymphs to bed. To impress their females, the demon and the vampire kiss on a dare.</p> <p><b>...changes them forever....</b></p> <p>Once they finally break away from their soul-searing kiss, they find themselves alone—and shaken.

Obstacles—ranging from a death sentence to exile on a war-torn dimension—threaten to destroy their lives and vulnerable promise in that one kiss.</p> <p>How long can they resist the fire that blazes between them?</p> <p>Even if Mirceo accepts Caspion as his fated mate, the seductive vampire still must convince the stubborn demon that their bond is forever. And any royal Dacian union must receive the blessing of King Lothaire, an unpredictable and savage killer....</p>";
