window.bookSummaryJSON = "Katrina Van Tassel. Katrina the flirt, the coquette, the tease—so called by the Sleepy Hollow villagers because she hasn't given her hand to one of her eager suitors. Everyone expects her to choose the muscled, handsome Brom over lean, studious Ichabod—but Katrina has objections to both of them. One autumn night, a harvest party at the Van Tassel house ends in a violent confrontation, and Katrina comes face to face with the most horrifying myth ever to haunt Sleepy Hollow—the Headless Horseman himself. Taken prisoner by the Horseman, Katrina is forced to confront her own prejudices and expectations as she discovers a deeper world of intrigue and magic. Contains mature themes. Trigger and content warnings are available on the author's website.";
