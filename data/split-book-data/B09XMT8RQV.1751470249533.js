window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Travis Bryant, known in the biker world as \"Curly\", spent 13 hard years behind bars for a heinous crime he didn’t commit. When the truth finally sets him free, nothing remains of his previous life.</p> <p>Curly doesn’t know how to live without the brotherhood of a club. After visiting the Hell’s Handler’s MC, he’s given the go-ahead to open a charter in his home state. Claiming an ol’ lady is the furthest thing from his mind until he meets Brooke, the beautiful, hardheaded, dog trainer bent on ending a violent dog-fighting ring near her home.</p> <p>After 10 long years married to an abusive narcissist, Brooke vowed she’d never live under another man’s thumb again. Accepting help doesn’t come easy, but when abandoned dogs begin popping up with fatal injuries, she’ll do anything to put an end to the fighting ring responsible—even enlisting the assistance of the most attractive man she’s ever met, and his outlaw MC brothers.</p> <p>From her feisty, independent spirit to her shapely legs, Brooke appeals to Curly on every level. He can’t keep himself away, but he’s been burned before, and has no plans to tie himself to a woman. Brooke is in the same boat, having promised herself no man would ever have control over her life again. Unfortunately, she can’t kick the curly-haired man in the biker boots out of her head or her bed.</p> <p>As Brooke and Curly grow closer and danger strikes, will they be able to overcome their past traumas and find strength in each other? Or will they remain stubborn and stick to their guns as their lives crash and burn?</p>";
