window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>GRAY: </p> <p>I've got a lot on my plate. Not only do I have my own pack to protect, but I keep the whole six-pack territory secure by training and running the security squad. The new recruits are here for the summer, and it's my job to whip them into shape. I can't afford any distractions, but one of the female recruits is doing just that- distracting me. Fallon is the most frustrating girl I've ever met; she's all alpha female and she openly challenges my authority. She's so far from my type, but for some reason, I'm drawn to her. It'll be a challenge to break her, but by the end of the summer, she will learn to obey her alpha. By the end of the summer, I'll have her on her knees.</p> <p>FALLON: </p> <p>All I've ever wanted is to be a part of the six-pack's security squad, defending our territory as a fighter. I've finally got a chance to live out my dream- all I've gotta do is make it through summer training camp and prove myself. I thought that the toughest part of training camp would be the actual training, but it turns out the alpha running the place is even tougher. I let one sarcastic comment slip, and now Alpha Gray seems hellbent on making an example out of me, provoking me at every opportunity. He wants me to fall in line, but I'll be damned if I'm going to roll over. Sure, he's insanely hot. He's an alpha. But I'm not backing down. He's not MY alpha.</p> <p>***The Six-Pack Series is a collection of werewolf shifter romance novels. These books contain mature content (steamy scenes!) and themes that may not be suitable for younger listeners. If frequent use of profanity and f-words offend, then these books may not be for you. This is book one of a six book series, though it ends without any major cliffhangers.</p>";
