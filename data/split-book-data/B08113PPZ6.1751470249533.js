Now they will subdue her.</b> </p> <p>The resistance sent them, but that's not really why these four battle-hardened Vakarrans are here. </p> <p>They came for me. To conquer me. To master me. To ravage me. To strip me bare, punish me for the slightest hint of defiance, and use my quivering virgin body in ways far beyond anything in even the very darkest of my dreams, until I've been utterly, completely, and shamefully subdued.</p> <p>I vow never to beg for mercy, but I can't help wondering how long it will be until I beg for more. </p> <p><b>Publisher's Note:</b> <i>Subdued</i> is a stand-alone novel which is the fourth book in the Vakarran Captives series. It includes spankings, sexual scenes, intense and humiliating punishments, and strong D/s themes. If such material offends you, please don't buy this book.</p>";
