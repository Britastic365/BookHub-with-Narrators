window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Detective Quinn Hughes doesn't have many regrets in life, but Sebastian Devlin is the biggest. As a cop and a defense lawyer, the deck was stacked against them to start with, but Quinn was the one who left a burning inferno behind him. Missing his chance with ex-Special Forces Commando Peyton Sinclair is a close second on his regrets list, but Quinn isn't going to ruin the happiness Peyton has found with fellow police officer Will McMahon for anything—not even a chance at his own happiness.</p> <p>Best friends Will McMahon and Peyton Sinclair have been hooking up for years, content with their arrangement and the comfort they get from it. When Sebastian—the hot lawyer they picked up at the club the night before—stumbles over a dead body in their kitchen on his way out, calling Quinn is instinctive for them. Years of unacknowledged tension between Peyton and Quinn is a sore point, but Peyton trusts that Quinn will figure out the mess they've landed in. They're hoping Quinn can move fast—before one of them becomes the next dead body. If they can survive long enough to get some answers, maybe the four of them together are going to be the catalyst for a future that's more wildly different than anything they'd ever imagined.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
