If he can't hand over the entrance to Olympus, his own life and those of his people will be forfeit. No matter the torture, Seth hasn't been able to break the god in his custody.

If she fails, an ancient curse will haunt the earth once more and no one will be safe. But evil is always seductive...</p>";
