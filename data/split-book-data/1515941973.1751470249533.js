window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A powerful witch. Four unlikely guardians. A curse that will create an unstoppable monster. </p> <p>Enslaved for years by a powerful crime lord, Bryn has been forced to harness her elemental magic to create vile potions that have harmed countless supernaturals. </p> <p>When the compound she's called home is attacked, Bryn escapes and tastes freedom for the first time in more than a decade. </p> <p>But when the sins of her past race to catch up with her, she realizes a taste might be all the freedom she's destined for. Bryn's unusually strong earth magic puts a target on her back, and when she's hit with a deadly curse, her only hope comes in the form of four dangerously sexy supernaturals. </p> <p>Taj, the fire-affinity witch who worked as her jailer. Poe, a panther-shifter assigned to bring in Bryn for a bounty. Silas, a daemon with a dark past. And Calder, a telekinetic and Bryn's first love. </p> <p>If the five of them can't work together, the curse will claim Bryn's life and her magic. If that happens, it will spell disaster for supernaturals everywhere. </p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
