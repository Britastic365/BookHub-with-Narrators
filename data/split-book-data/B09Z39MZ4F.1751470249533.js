Tucker comes the dark and steamy Dirty Empire series.</p> <p>One visit to my father in prison—convicted for a murder he didn't commit—and I've attracted the attention of the last man I'd ever want knowing that I exist.</p> <p>Gabriel Easton. Son of an infamous crime boss. Deplorable womanizer. Scoundrel to the core. Worse, he has figured out how desperate I am to protect my father from brutality behind bars. He has the power to grant that protection, and he has offered it . . . for a price.</p> <p>Me. I am to become a \"guest\" in his mansion, to live with him until he tires of having me around. I'll do anything for my father, including agree to Gabriel's cruel game. But I won't comply with his every whim and wish. Not when he taunts me with that ruthless spark in his cold blue eyes. Not when he requires that I share his bedroom at night.</p> <p>Unfortunately for me, I think my loathing for him is what he's enjoying most. That's fine. By the time I'm through with him, he'll be crying my name. Mercy.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
