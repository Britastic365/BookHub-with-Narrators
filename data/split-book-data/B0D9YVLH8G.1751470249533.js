I'm quaking in my cheap boots at just the thought of having four husbands.</p> <p>One is bad enough, am I right?</p> <p>Except when I decide to run for it to get a little space, I'm kidnapped and taken on the adventure of a lifetime. Now, I'm not even sure if the men I rejected over and over are coming to get me, or if I'm doomed.</p> <p>I guess I have a choice: try to escape, or keep hoping that I wasn't too much of a pain in the butt to be rescued. Here's hoping my incontinent badgers are better fighters than they are romantics!</p> <p>Blood of the Ruthless <i>is a steamy fantasy reverse harem with a sassy heroine, lots of humor, and four sexy princes that only our heroine can resist.</i></p>";
