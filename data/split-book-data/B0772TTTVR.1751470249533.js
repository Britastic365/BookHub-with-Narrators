window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When a food storage depot in famine-struck South Sudan is torched, American aid worker Brie Stewart flees, only to land in a market where she's the next item up for auction. Is the attack on the aid facility another assault upon the war-torn fledgling democracy, or has her family set her up as a pawn in their quest for oil rights? </p><p>Chief Warrant Officer Sebastian Ford crossed paths with Brie years ago when she was a shill for her family's company, pushing a pipeline that threatened his tribe's land. Determined to lead the rescue operation to save her, he won't let her abduction - or the attraction that flares between them - get in the way of settling their unfinished business. </p><p>The Green Beret's skills are put to the test in the flooded grasslands of South Sudan, where they must battle nature and dangerous factions who are after more than oil. Bastian and Brie put their hearts on the line as they find themselves embroiled in a conflict that extends beyond country and continent. Together they must douse the spark before it reaches the flashpoint and engulfs everything they hold dear. </p>";
