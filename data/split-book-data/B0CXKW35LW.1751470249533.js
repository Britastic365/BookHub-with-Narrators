The second in a completed trilogy narrated by Michael Lesley. </b><br> <br> Phex and his pantheon have become demigods and are taking their show on a galaxy-wide tour. Phex is shockingly good at singing but his voice is intoxicating and one wrong note can kill so everyone wants a piece of him - sometimes literally. But the aliens in charge of the divinity are hiding something even more sinister and it’s hurting performers and audiences alike. When his lover is pitted against his pantheon, Phex will have to choose between the family he has found and the god he adores.<br> <br> Let’s take this show on the road - where the show is divine and the road is through the stars. Be careful, the moment you start listening you may never want to stop, and you just might kill to keep the music alive.</p> <p>Murderbot meets <i>Eurovision</i> in the second of the Tinkered Starsong trilogy in which the mystery of the Dyesi is finally uncovered. </p> <p>(This book follows <i>Divinity 36</i> and precedes <i>Dome 6.)<br> <br> </i><b><i>Also by Carriger set in the same universe</i></b></p> <ul> <li><i>Crudrat</i></li> <li><i>The 5th Gender</i></li> </ul>";
