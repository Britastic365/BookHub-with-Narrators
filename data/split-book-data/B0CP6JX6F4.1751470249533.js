window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Eurydice Dimitriou has always been the innocent one, the sheltered one. No longer. She’s finally ready to step out of the long shadow cast by her mothers and sisters. After her ex broke her heart, she’s picking up the pieces in the lower city…with the help of Charon, a man she’s drawn to even as she’s not sure she has enough heart left to give.</p> <p>Charon Ariti has been Hades’s right-hand man for years. He’s given everything to the lower city, but now he’s ready to take something for himself. Even knowing it might be a mistake, he’s drawn to Eurydice’s hidden strength and her determination to keep moving forward. He’s only too happy to give her a special kind of education…at least until her ex comes calling.</p> <p>Orpheus Makos will do whatever it takes to make things right. Once the golden boy of the upper city, he’s now lost everything. His art, his fortune, his fame? They’re nothing compared to the love he can’t stop thinking about. He’ll do anything to get her back…even if it means she’s not coming into his arms alone.</p> <p>But with enemies slipping through Olympus’s faltering barrier into the lower city in increasing numbers, a trio of broken hearts will be the least of these lovers’ worries</p>";
