window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Lieutenant Ashwin Malhotra is a Makhai soldier - genetically engineered to be cold, ruthless. Unfeeling. His commanding officers consider him the perfect operative, and they're right. Now, he has a simple mission: to infiltrate Gideon's Riders, the infamous sect of holy warriors that protects the people of Sector One. </p> <p>He's never failed to execute an objective, but there's one thing he didn't anticipate: running into Dr. Kora Bellamy, the only woman to ever break through his icy exterior. </p> <p>When Kora fled her life as a military doctor for the Makhai Project, all she wanted was peace - a quiet life where she could heal the sick and injured. The royal Rios family welcomed her like a sister, but she could never forget Ashwin. His sudden reappearance is a second chance - if she can manage to touch his heart. </p> <p>When the simmering tension between them finally ignites, Kora doesn't realize she's playing with fire. Because she's not just falling in love with a man who may not be able to love her back. Ashwin has too many secrets - and one of them could destroy her. </p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
