window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A grown-up and depressed Peter Pan is fighting to protect Neverland from the realm-conquering Commodore Hook. When Peter's runaway shadow shows up at Wendy's workplace, she's eager for the chance to visit Neverland again, to help protect itâ€”and sure, to see the Fae man she's been in love with for ten years. But Neverland is far different than Wendy remembers, with monsters both literal and human-shaped threatening everything Peter has tried to build. Contains mature themes. Trigger and content warnings are available on the author's website.</p>";
