Forever.</b><br> <br> Destiny isn’t something you can outrun—not when the stars have plans for your life and don’t bother asking for your opinion.<br> <br> I finally had all my mates together, but it didn’t last. One is missing, my mother is on the run, and Asrael is closing in. To make things worse, visions of terrifying things yet to come haunt my every step.<br> <br> Failure isn’t just an option—it’s a death sentence.<br> <br> Together, we’ll brave the storm, fight for our future, and embrace the destiny written in the stars—even if it demands the ultimate sacrifice.</p> <p><i>The Emerald Lakes omnibus 2 includes </i><b><i>book 4-5: Magic of Destiny, Magic of Eternity</i></b><i>.
