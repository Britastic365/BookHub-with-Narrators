window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Life as a raider in the Wastes, where monsters roam and the military lurks, is as easy as it sounds.</b></p> <p>I’ve been out here for a long time, and the fear that courses through my blood every time I step outside our camp walls to scavenge never fades. No matter how many monsters you face—and have to run for your life from—it doesn’t ever get easier.</p> <p>But when I come across a bound and injured monster in an abandoned military base, I can’t leave him behind. His presence in our camp is causing tension, but I can’t bring myself to care when I get to see a different side to him—when he starts to show me who he is beneath the pain and lingering trauma.</p> <p>Despite his gentle nature, I soon discover why others are so desperate to own him; why the military, and now this stranger lurking outside our camp, want to put him back in chains and take him away from me.</p> <p>Something is hiding under his skin, something that threatens to upend my entire life.</p> <p>There’s a reason why all other monsters fear him.</p> <p><i>The Rycke</i> contains explicit sexual content, graphic depictions of torture and violence, and deals with PTSD. It is book three in the Monstrous series, a post-apocalyptic m/m fantasy series that features monsters and human men falling in love. It is best to listen to the series in order.</p>";
