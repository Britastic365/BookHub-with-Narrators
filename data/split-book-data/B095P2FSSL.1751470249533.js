As a single dad with nowhere else to go, I moved into her guest house. And somehow, through the guilt and grief, we forged an unlikely team. </p> <p>It took years, but I watched the gradual return of her smile - slow and life-altering. </p> <p>The two of us could sit outside for hours talking about nothing, and it filled the massive hole in my chest with new life. </p> <p>I may have carried her out of that fire, but the truth was, Bree saved me.</p> <p>As we healed, the secrets and lies of the past smoldered in the ashes, threatening to ignite again. </p> <p>Our love was born from the embers, and together, we would go up in flames. </p>";
