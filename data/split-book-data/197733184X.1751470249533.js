For Kylie Strange, it just means more deaths she's responsible for since she's the one who accidentally unleashed a Pandora's box of horrors on the small town in the first place. She opened the Booke of the Hidden, and now she must do everything she can to close it for good, taking on every monster it releases with the help of the local coven.</p> <p>This time, the Booke has unleashed not one but two demons on the village. With her attention divided, Kylie and her coven of Wiccans are open to attack. But those aren't the only demons on Kylie's mind. There's also Erasmus Dark, the Booke's alluring and dangerous demon guardian she can't seem to stay away from. Even though she really should...since she's also got her eye on the handsome and human Sheriff Ed Bradbury.</p> <p>When digging for answers in the town's past leads to the ghost of Kylie's grandfather, everything she thought she knew and remembered gets turned upside down. Can Kylie save the town and her grandfather, or will the horrors of the Booke be too much to handle?</p> <p><i>Contains mature themes.</i></p>";
