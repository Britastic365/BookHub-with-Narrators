Captured, I’m locked behind electrified bars in a genetic lab where a researcher throws the female into my cell and demands we reproduce.<br> <br> I vow to do everything in my power to make my little mate happy, but I won’t claim her until I extricate us from this cruel prison. Once we’re free, she can have anything she wants from me so long as she doesn’t want me to let her go.</p> <p><b>BRIANNA</b><br> Once, I was a golden child. The perfect accessory for my parents’ social climbing. Then their prospects soured, and they sent me to Utopia. Betrayed by everyone, I gave up on life and love. Then I was thrown in a prison cell with a red-hot alien demon, the first being to ever truly protect me. I don’t understand his growls and snarls, but inside the curve of Trjun’s wings, I do know I am safe.<br> <br> Teamwork and a bit of luck help us escape the secret lab, and with the sun on my face, I swear I’ll never live for anyone but myself again. But one look at Trjun and I want to throw caution to the wind. Do I dare stay safe in his arms forever?<br> <br> <b><i>A Monster’s Love</i></b><b> is a sci-fi alien romance with a growly hero, lots of action, and an HEA, guaranteed.
