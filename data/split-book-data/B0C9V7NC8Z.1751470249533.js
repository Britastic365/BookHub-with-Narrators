window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A jilted book nerd, a plan for sweet revenge, and the two hockey studs who volunteer as her tributes in this bestselling hockey romance performed with duet narration by Samantha Brentmoor, JF Harding and Robert Hatchet...</p> <p>When I discover my boyfriend is cheating on me, I move out right away taking what I love most – my dog. As I fly out the door, I make sure to swipe the thing my ex loves best–the VIP tickets he won to a hockey game, complete with the chance to spend an evening with the city’s two biggest NHL stars. I can’t wait to snap selfies with my ex’s idols and rub it in his face.</p> <p>Except, when I head out with the two hockey studs, they have something else in mind besides sweet revenge. Would I like to spend the night…with both of them? Talk about the VIP experience.</p> <p>That’s what I get for one knee-weakening, sheet-grabbing night. In the morning, I plan to return to my bestie’s house to crash on her couch with my dog. But when they learn what happened with my awful ex, they ask me to be their temporary roomie for the week. Oh, and one of them needs my help with his grumpy reputation. The other? Well, he wants me to be his fake date at an upcoming wedding.</p> <p>Looks like I’m about to get double pucked. Again.</p>";
