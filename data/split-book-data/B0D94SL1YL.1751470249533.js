window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>***This is a dual narrated and multi-cast holiday novella that can be listened to as a standalone, but is best heard as part of the Mystics and Mayhem world!***</p> <p>One bright idea. One holiday. Lots of chaos. Cait wants to have the perfect Christmas, but Roman thinks she’s possibly lost her mind. Then, when nothing seems to be going right, she just might agree with him. But freak snowstorms, Grinch-y wolf shifters, missing dragons, and new mate bonds won’t stop the festivities.</p> <p>With the help of Lucinda, Andie, Amersyn, and even Dawsyn, Cait’s Christmas celebrations continue. It doesn’t matter that someone spiked the punch, the power has gone out, and that there might not be enough food for everyone to eat. The gang’s all back together and by the time the clock strikes midnight...There just might be a little surprise waiting under the tree for each of them.</p>";
