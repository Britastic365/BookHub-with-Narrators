window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Murder is in the cards at one Vegas casino, but is love too?</b></p> <p>All I wanted was one more hot night with the woman of my dreams. Instead, all I got was both of us drunk and accidently married at my resort.</p> <p>Maybe this isn’t such a bad deal, since we must stay together for my inheritance, but how do I explain that to the new Mrs. Cartwright? If we could stop flirting, kissing, and taking this too far one too many times…</p> <p>Don’t get me wrong, Lowri is gorgeous, smart, and spunky, but I don’t want a wife forever. Marriage isn’t for me. I’ve seen the pain it can cause, no matter what sparks fly between us. If I drag my feet long enough hopefully she can see the benefits for holding off on the annulment.</p> <p>And as if I don’t have enough on my plate, I have a murder on the casino floor hitting the news and an employee threatening my livelihood. With shows falling apart, a royal party to plan, and learning I’m too close to the mafia…in an instant, I could lose everything my family built.</p> <p>Will love be my lucky lady and deal me a better hand?</p> <p><b>Reckless Chance</b> is the third book in the Love Over Murders series. Each book is a standalone story featuring one couple’s journey to their guaranteed H.E.A. and no cliffhanger. The series is especially for lovers of swoony moments intertwined with a murder mystery.</p>";
