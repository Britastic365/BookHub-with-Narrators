window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>So apparently my mom was a witch. And not just a witch, but a witch who turned bad. My poor, sweet, normal dad wanted me to have a good college experience. Instead I get a magical offer I literally can't refuse, from the world's most elite school for warlocks. </p> <p>Warlocks. As in guy witches. </p> <p>Even though I definitely have lady parts, somehow I ended up at a warlock school to learn the gentlemanly arts (which are a lot more badass than, ahem, lady magic). Did I mention the witch world is stuck in the 19th century? Unmarried witches and warlocks barely see each other outside of society balls, which are still a thing. </p> <p>My existence here breaks all the rules. Am I here for the right reasons? Or am I the pawn meant to destroy the very world I'm starting to love? When my magic proves stronger than anyone expects, and the school is attacked by a demon, I'll need help from the four gorgeous magical men who are willing to break a few rules with me. They're each forbidden to me in their own way, and the greatest danger of all might not be demons, but falling for them. All of them. </p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
