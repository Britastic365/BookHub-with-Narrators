The only thing I wanted was Conley Logan.</p> <p>When words failed to express my feelings for Conley, I relied on music instead. But our love song ended before it even began - before I’d even told her how I truly felt. As a result, I watched Conley leave hand-in-hand with my bandmate instead of me.</p> <p>Not wanting the fight that would break up the band, I made a choice. I lived with it every day, knowing it was nobody’s fault but my own. I’ve moved on. I’m content with my small-town life, running a bar. But now Conley is back, forcing me to face the music.</p> <p>From the way I’m still tempted to make her mine, it's as if nothing has changed - but until she tells me why she's back, I'm not sure I can trust what’s growing between us. </p> <p>The only thing that has changed: I’m not letting her get away this time without a fight.</p> <p><b>There are four stand-alone books in the Billingsley series:</b></p> <p><i>Redeeming Lottie</i> - Tucker and Lottie</p> <p><i>Chasing Hannah</i> - Billy and Hannah</p> <p><i>Taming Wes</i> - Wes and Devin</p> <p><i>Tempting Tim</i> - Tim and Conley</p>";
