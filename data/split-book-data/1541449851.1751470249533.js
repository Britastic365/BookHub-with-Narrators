window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Sadie Sawyer wants to learn how to blow a guy. She's my sister's best friend. The girl I've known since grade school. The girl I've always considered off-limits. She's the girl that crawled under a table in a bar one night and changed everything between us. Now the brain in my pants is more than willing to step up. </p> <p>The rules are simple. No kissing. No screwing. No falling in love. But the more I let her use my body in the name of experimentation, the more I know being friends isn't enough. Is it too much to want it all with her?</p> <p>The taste of her lips. The sweetness of her innocence. The chance to earn her love. I might have a real shot with her...if her douchebag ex and my past don't ruin everything.</p> <p><i>Contains mature themes.</i></p>";
