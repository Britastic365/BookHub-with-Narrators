window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Taken. Prized. Possessed. Loved. </b></p> <p>Clover is an orphan and has led a tough and chaotic life. No stability. No money. No friends. He trusts no one.</p> <p>His already miserable life takes a nosedive when he ends up in the hands of a human trafficking gang. Someone has placed a request for a young albino man, and Clover is to become the property of a mysterious buyer who will stop at nothing to satisfy his depraved desire. Clover’s fate seems sealed until four bounty hunters appear to take out his captors and accidentally save him.</p> <p>The four mercenaries want to move on, but when Clover pleads for protection, they offer it to him at a price. In the beginning, the arrangement is all kinds of shady, but as he gets to know the four men who’ve taken him on a wild ride, his developing feelings might become as dangerous as the elusive buyer.</p> <p>But, can a relationship with four such different men even work? Men who kill for a living? Men so full of contradictions?</p> <p><b>Tank:</b> The massive ex-soldier eager to be Clover’s daddy.</p> <p><b>Pyro:</b> Wild, tattooed, with a filthy mouth and an itch for violence.</p> <p><b>Boar:</b> Ginger, bearded, a big teddy bear who can turn into a grizzly.</p> <p><b>Drake:</b> Dark and dangerous, with a tongue as sharp as his knives.</p> <p>Can these men provide him with the love and security he craves? Or, has Clover made the worst mistake of his life?</p> <p><b>Please note: </b><i>Their Bounty</i> is a dark, gay harem contemporary romance and the first in the Four Mercenaries trilogy. The story contains scenes of explicit violence, offensive language, morally ambiguous characters, and lots of scorching-hot, emotional, explicit scenes.</p>";
