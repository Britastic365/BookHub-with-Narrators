window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The day I left Wilder Valley, I swore I’d never return.</b></p> <p>My dreams were too big for this small town, and I was determined to make it in LA, even if that meant leaving behind the man I loved.</p> <p>Now I’m back, brokenhearted and publicly humiliated after a colossal breakup live-streamed to the masses. I have no career or money to show for my 23 years away. If I could hide out anywhere else on the planet, I would.</p> <p>Instead, I resort to taking the only job in town. A nanny gig for my high school sweetheart.</p> <p>Life didn’t go as planned for him either.</p> <p>Ryan Wilder might be running his family ranch and looking like a tall glass of water while doing it, but he’s also drowning in responsibility, raising three children on his own, and dealing with the challenges of caring for his aging father.</p> <p>We strike up a deal to help each other out. He offers me a place to stay along with a steady paycheck. In exchange I keep his teenagers out of trouble while figuring out my next step. Everything is perfect until those pesky little feelings from our youth come roaring back.</p> <p>This time is different, though. We’ve experienced life, and we know what we want. At least, I thought I did. All the dreams I had for myself existed outside of this town, but the more time I spend with Ryan and his family, the more I question everything. Including my wild heart.</p> <p><b>Narrated by Holly Warren and Robert Hatchet, </b><b><i>Wild Hearts </i></b><b>is a steamy second-chance small-town later-in-life romance between a single dad in his 40s and the one who got away!</b></p>";
