window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>AN ALL-NEW UNABRIDGED RECORDING NARRATED BY LORELEI KING!</b><br> <br> <b>From Janet Evanovich, the “most popular mystery writer alive” (</b><b><i>The New York Times</i></b><b>), comes the fifth novel in the entertaining and enthralling Stephanie Plum series.</b><br> <br> Out of bail skippers and rent money, Stephanie Plum throws caution to the wind and follows in the entrepreneurial bootsteps of Super Bounty Hunter, Ranger, engaging in morally corrupt and marginally legal enterprises. So, a scumbag blows himself to smithereens on her first day of policing a crack house and the sheik she was chauffeuring stole the limo. But hey, nobody’s perfect!<br> <br> Anyway, Stephanie has other things on her mind. Her mother wants her to find Uncle Fred who’s missing after arguing with his garbage company; homicidal rapist Benito Ramirez is back, quoting scripture and stalking Stephanie; vice cop Joe Morelli has a box of condoms with Stephanie’s name on it; and Stephanie’s afraid Ranger has his finger on her trigger. The whole gang’s here for mirth and mayhem in Janet Evanovich’s <i>High Five</i>. Listen at your own risk in public places.</p>";
