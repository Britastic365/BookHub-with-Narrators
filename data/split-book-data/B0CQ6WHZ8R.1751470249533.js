window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>This box set contains the last three stories set in the Danger Universe and is filled with deadly magic, non-stop action, and irresistible romance.</b><br> <br> <br> <b><i>Promise of Danger</i></b><br> <br> To save Nord, Lina would do anything. Even bloodswear a vow to the infamous King of the Underground. Now she’s missing, and Quinn and Finley must help Nord before he tears the world apart in his search for her.<br> <br> Because when a berserker’s mate is in jeopardy, there’s no line he won’t cross, no sin he won’t commit, to rescue her.<br> <br> <b><i>Call of Danger</i></b><br> <br> Nord and Lina have walked through seemingly insurmountable trials to be together. With a love that couldn’t be stopped, not even by death, they’ve come out the other side stronger than before. But their fight isn’t over, not by a long shot. One final enemy remains, and this time, victory has never been less certain.<br> <br> <b><i>Bound by Danger</i></b><br> <br> Quinn Satori has been keeping secrets. Big ones. As a memory weaver, the mind has always been her playground, the truth whatever she needed people to believe. After years of being the one holding all the cards, she never expected her gift would come back to haunt her in the form of Finley St. Aubyn.<br> <br> Hunky British billionaire. Immortal Guardian. Giant pain in her ass.<br> <br> One incredible night, that’s all it was supposed to be. She never planned on catching feelings. Or for him to show up years later and dredge it all back up. The worst part? He doesn’t remember any of it…thanks to her.<br> <br> <br> <b>This is the second set of books in the Undercover Magic series, a steamy and suspenseful paranormal romance following a ghost and a berserker's chance meeting at The Monster Ball. Thankfully, the ball was just the beginning for these two fated lovers. So if you adore overprotective, ax-wielding heroes, smoldering sexual tension, supernatural secret societies, and loads of banter, you’ve just found your next listen!</b></p>";
