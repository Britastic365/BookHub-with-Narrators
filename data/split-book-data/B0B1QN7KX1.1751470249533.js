window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>He saved me from a vengeful wolf but became a monster to do it. And now I’ve lost him. My Viking. My Alek.</p> <p>Locked away in Novasgard, he’s beyond reach. I have no way to find him. No way to tell him about my secret. About the two words that changed everything. To make matters worse, Noah and Caleb want nothing to do with me now that they know. Two little words, and I’m on the verge of losing them.</p> <p>My confessor. My berserker. My prince. My alpha…the only one remaining by my side.</p> <p>A couple months ago, my biggest worry was finding my wolf. Now, we’re dealing with demons, and fending off attacks from the fae. For every enemy we defeat, more lurk in the shadows. The one thing they all have in common? They’re after me. We’re not safe anywhere, and there’s something dark and powerful inside me—something only Alek can help me control. I have to get him back to fix what’s broken between all of us. Because if I’ve learned anything since coming to Ravenscroft, it’s that I’m not going to survive this without my mates. All four of them.</p> <p><b>Warning:</b> This series is not for the faint of heart. It contains an obsessive stalker, a foul-mouthed, inked and pierced werewolf, a naughty professor with a fondness for watching, a god of mischief, and plenty of heat. If you don’t like your books spicy, your men broody, built, and more bad than good, this is not the series for you. But if you do, listen on, and welcome to The Mate Games.</p>";
