They were immersed in the paranormal world while he was away at college, living the life of an ordinary human.</p> <p>One night, while he was walking home, he saw a dog in need of help. Turns out, it wasn’t a dog at all.</p> <p>Kandra was a wolf shifter on the run. She’d fled an abusive relationship, running from a male she once thought she could trust. As a lone wolf, she was free, but she was also slowly dying.</p> <p>Pack life wasn’t something Kandra wanted, and she never thought she’d trust another male. Yet, she trusted Brayden. In him, she found the opportunity to join a new pack - shifters who would be there when she needed them.</p> <p>But the past came calling, and they would take back what was theirs. </p> <p>Kandra’s life was in danger, and Brayden would do whatever it took to keep his mate safe, including asking a vampire to bite him. His new life was extraordinary, because she was in it. </p> <p>With his vampire-given powers, Brayden was ready to fight for the one he loved. Now, all he had to do was find her.</p>";
