I can’t bring myself to look at Reaper or Gunner, let alone speak to them. I don’t know where my love life stands, or if I even have one anymore. Only Jandro is my rock, and only my work gives me purpose.</p> <p>Eager for a distraction, I jump at the chance to become a battle medic again. Little did I know it would force me to end the weeks of silence between me and my men. And it’s made me realize I might not be ready to let them go after all.</p> <p>Forgiveness is a long way off, however. Before I can even consider it, Horus tells me it’s time to leave.</p> <p>I have to find Shadow with the sky god as my only guide. And somehow, I must find a way to end the senseless violence coming for everyone I love.</p> <p><i>Sons of Anarchy</i> meets <i>The Handmaid's Tale</i> in this dystopian reverse harem adventure!
