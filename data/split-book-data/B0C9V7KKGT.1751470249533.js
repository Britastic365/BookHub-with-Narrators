Dover delivers an enticing enemies-to-lovers romance with a magical twist!</p> <p>Twenty-five years have passed since the darkness was defeated in the Land of the Fae. Since then, the realm has flourished under the four courts. However, nothing is as it seems. An evil lurks close by, known as the Shadow Fae. Years ago, a plan was set in motion to keep the darkness alive. But there is one who’s destined to defeat it.</p> <p>Ella, the future queen of the Frost Court, has trained to embrace her destiny and save her people. When Kai, the Shadow Fae leader, crosses paths with Ella, he knows it’s his time to strike. Yet, things take a shocking turn when he begins to long for the one woman he’s supposed to kill. While passion ignites between the enemies, there is no escaping their fates. Ella is meant to save her people, and Kai has no choice but to end them. A decision must be made, and it could cost them everything.</p> <p><i>New York Times</i> and<i> USA Today </i>best-selling author L. P. Dover is a southern belle living in North Carolina with her husband and two beautiful girls. \"Everything’s sweeter in the South\" has always been her mantra, whether it’s with her writing or in her everyday life. Maybe that’s why she’s seriously addicted to chocolate. Dover has written countless novels in several different genres, including a children’s book with her daughter. Her favorite to write is romantic suspense, but she’s also found a passion in romantic comedy. She loves to make people laugh, which is why you’ll never see her without a smile on her face.</p>";
