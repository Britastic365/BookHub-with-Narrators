window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I never thought I'd be singing happy birthday to myself in a dungeon. And yet when a sinfully sexy demon crashes happy hour, that's exactly what happens. He’s known as the Lord of Chaos, he’s mistaken me for my succubus doppelgänger.</p> <p>Happy birthday to me.</p> <p>When he tastes my blood, he finally understands I’m mortal. And I realize we have something in common: We both crave revenge. So we make a deal: I can stay in the forbidden city to hunt for my mom's killer. In return, I’ll help him get the vengeance he craves. I just have to pose as a sexy succubus. One problem - he's my number one suspect.</p> <p>And that’s increasingly hard to remember as he teaches me my role: seduction. With each heated touch I drift further into peril. And if I fall under his seductive spell, death awaits me.</p> <p><b>\"I flew through this book.... Hot demon lord - check. Action - check. Romance - check. And there's spice! If you love my books, you definitely want to read this one.\" (Laura Thalassa)</b></p>";
