window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>My name is Nilsa. <br> <br> I am the Shadow of the Moon. <br> <br> Born to end the life of the Eagle of Galmere. <br> <br> And I have failed. <br> <br> Ever since I left my pirates, things have gone from bad to worse. Now, stuck in the darkest part of the Claw—the mine that serves as a prison for supernaturals and humans alike—there's no way to return the sea and the men I've slowly begun to trust. <br> <br> Instead I'm forced down into the depths of the earth, where ancient things lurk in dark, forgotten places. The key to my freedom is in dubious alliances with dangerous creatures. The only thing we have in common; we want to kill the Queen. <br> <br> When I'm finally reunited with my pirates, will we be able to find my final mate and end the Queen's vile reign? Or will their vow to her and my secrets ruin everything? <br> <br> <b>This is a slow/medium burn reverse harem novel intended for listeners aged 18 years and over. Book 2 of 3 in the Deadwood Series.</b></p>";
