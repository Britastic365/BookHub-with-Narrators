window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>My brother believes he made me a killer. The truth is I’ve always been different. I can smile while sliding a knife between your ribs - and not feel a moment of regret.</p> <p>Until Leah.</p> <p>A man like me shouldn’t have a family. But the minute I opened my eyes from a coma and saw her, I knew I’d forever be tied to her. A nurse who nurtures life. A mother. I’ve watched her for two years, unable to stop but refusing to give in to the need to have her. To love her. Until the night her daughter is taken. I’ll light up the world to get Leah’s child back to her. And then I’ll walk away for good. Not because it’s the right thing to do, but because I know how she’ll look at me after seeing who I truly am.</p> <p>She’ll see the murderer inside me. And God help me, but she’ll be right.</p>";
