window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>“Being the daughter of the Devil isn't what it's all cracked up to be, believe me.”</p> <p>My name is Abigail Morningstar, and my whole life, I’ve felt out of place being the only angel among the demons.</p> <p>But I have a chance to get the break I need in the form of a deal.</p> <p>What deal, you ask? The funny thing is, I have to live with my mother for three years. The very mother who abandoned me as a baby.</p> <p>Enrolling at Angelic Academy should have been a nice change, but once again, things weren't that easy. Being the demon princess paints a target on my back, and everyone seems to want a shot. It doesn't help when the three sons of the top ranking Archangels are the leaders. One who happens to be my step-brother.</p> <p>I have no idea what I did to piss them off so badly, but I'm not going down without a fight.</p> <p>Thankfully I'm not alone. I have my best friend Leo, a virgin incubus, and a dark angel Zed, who is surprisingly sweeter than the angels who call themselves holy.</p> <p>One thing for sure—just because something is white as snow, doesn't mean it's pure.</p> <p>Angelic Academy is a why-choose enemies-to-lovers step-brother and friends-to-lover why-choose series. It is a medium burn with medium to heavy bullying. All characters involved in sexual activity are of age and consensual, despite what it may look like. Described sexual scenes and swearing. Contains 18+ MM content.</p>";
