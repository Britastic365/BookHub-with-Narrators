window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Riley’s Guardians are breaking apart, and he fears he can’t put them back together again. </b></p> <p>A hybrid born of an Angel-Fallen union, Riley Shepard is an anomaly coveted by both sides of an ancient war. But he doesn’t want to fight their war; he has his own battles to face. As his family fractures, bonds are tested, and forbidden feelings threaten to tear his heart into bloody thirds. </p> <p>When the next attack comes - not from the outside but from within - is he strong enough to separate truth from lies, allies from enemies, reality from fantasy? How can Riley know what’s true, when he doesn’t even know what’s real? </p> <p>Life isn’t simple, love is complicated, and reality is terrifyingly blurry. </p> <p><i>Illusion</i> is the third book in the slow-burn harem/poly romance series, Fire &amp; Brimstone, featuring hurt/comfort and broken but brave guardian angels; the first spicy taste of love, and an unlikely hero who learns to embrace his deepest desires. </p> <p>Trigger warnings include: aftermath and non-graphic mentions of sexual assault, self-destructive behavior, and situations of mental instability.</p>";
