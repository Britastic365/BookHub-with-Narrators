The Triad, made up of Hades, Loki, and Fenrir, rules the school and they expect me to bow down like everyone else.</p> <p>Sure, Janus. Cue eyeroll.</p> <p>The three of them share everything, and when I humiliate Hades my first night at the Academy by making the tiniest immortal faux pas, their lust turns to cruelty and they start to edge in on my side hustle, but that's fine with me. Four can play at that game.</p>";
