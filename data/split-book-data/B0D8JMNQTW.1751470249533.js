He would look after me in a world where no one else did. He would manipulate all the strings that held up my life until I had exactly the one I wanted.</p> <p>And then one night, I met him. Only he wasn't the hero I always imagined he would be.</p> <p>When we left the forest together that night, I thought I'd escaped the villains relatively unscathed, but my true villain was the man whose arms I felt safest in. He was the one who would tear me apart.</p> <p>Now I know the only way to save myself is to stay far away from Killian Walsh. But no matter how fast I run, he won't stop chasing me.</p> <p>He knows the best thing he could do for me is set me free. But he's too selfish to do it.</p> <p>He calls me reckless, but I think he's crazy.
