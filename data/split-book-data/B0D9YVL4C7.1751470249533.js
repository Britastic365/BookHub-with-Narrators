It was that, or marry a man my father auctioned me to when I was a little girl.</b></p> <p>I knew my father wouldn't make it easy, but color me surprised when he sent Caelian Del Rossa to find me.</p> <p>The man is a menace. Arrogant. Infuriating. Enigmatic.</p> <p>He thinks he's my knight in shining armor. I'm convinced he's nothing more than my father's retriever.</p> <p>Turns out my father asked the Dark Sovereign for help to get him out of the deal and me out of a marriage from hell.</p> <p>Their solution? Marry Caelian instead.</p> <p>Granted, like me, he's not exactly thrilled about it. But he's a Del Rossa. Loyalty runs in his veins. He'll do what's expected of him.</p> <p>But I'm not a puppet. I can't be controlled or manipulated. No smoldering looks or electrifying touches are going to tame me.</p> <p>And definitely not that one little thing that seems to set every nerve in my body on fire. The one thing that makes Caelian so dangerously seductive.</p> <p>The hunt.</p>";
