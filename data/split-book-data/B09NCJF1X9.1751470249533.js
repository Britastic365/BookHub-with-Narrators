I learned to live with it, I built a new life for myself, and I found a way to love the new body I was given…there’s just one thing I can’t accept. </p> <p>I have no right to want someone as vibrant and beautiful as Nolan, not when a very vital part of my anatomy doesn’t always work anymore. What use would a man like that be to him? </p> <p>Alden can’t seem to stop meddling between the two of us, and I hate to admit it, but there’s something about him that manages to fix what’s broken in me. </p> <p>Has anyone else ever developed a Daddy kink after getting blown to smithereens, or is it just me? </p> <p>More importantly, are the three of us going to be able to find a way to fit together?</p> <p><i>Stubborn Boys</i> is the third book in the Perfect Boys series. It can be listened to as a stand-alone, but will be more fun as part of the series.</p>";
