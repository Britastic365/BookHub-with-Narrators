window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>Sure, I can rock a tank top and ponytail while collecting ancient relics, but don’t call me a tomb raider. I knew the guy who built the pyramids...and I mean in the biblical sense. </i></b></p> <p>Archaeologist, fashionista, and an ancient immortal with a serious memory problem, Dr. Nia Rivers has spent the last few centuries filling in the blanks of her past, all while outrunning dark assassins and stealing brief moments alone with Zane, her immortal lover. </p> <p>But when a 2,000-year-old relic from her past resurfaces, Nia isn't sure if the story connected to it is one she wants told to the world. The fact that Tres Mohandis, a fellow immortal and Nia’s greatest rival, is determined to develop the land and bury the site before Nia can excavate it suggests some dark history lies hidden in the site. Worse, Nia is beginning to realize that she doesn’t dislike the broody billionaire land developer as much as she remembers. </p> <p>Letting Tres have his way might be best for Nia, especially when the truth might expose a horrific crime from Nia's past - one with her name written all over it. But don’t all stories deserve to be told? Even the ugliest ones.</p> <p>Even if it proves she’s not at all who she thinks she is. </p> <p><i>Get this hot urban fantasy featuring spine-tingling adventure, twists on historical mysteries, and thrilling romance, where Tomb Raider meets Indiana Jones - and they live forever!</i></p>";
