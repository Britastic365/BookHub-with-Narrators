window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It all begins with a painting called <i>Guilt</i>. Eve Duncan’s daughter, Jane, has no idea why she painted the portrait of the chilling face that now hangs in a Paris gallery. But the members of a cult that dates back to the time of Christ know both the face and the significance behind it.

But for now they target those close to her, killing without mercy or conscience. </p> <p>Jane’s journey takes her from Paris to Scotland to a cave in the Holy Land, as she fights with all she has to save her life. Even with Eve’s help, can she possibly escape before the clock stops ticking?</p> <p><i>Eight Days to Live</i> begins with an ancient conspiracy and a shocking betrayal, but will it end with the death of Eve Duncan and the sacrifice of Jane MacGuire?
