window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An innocent woman. A deadly assassin. </b><b><i>The perfect revenge.</i></b></p> <p><i>Assassin’s Mark</i></p> <p>I knew the minute I saw him that Levi Agozi was too perfect to be real. I didn't care. He came to me, asked for me, and, dazzled by his dark good looks and the bad-boy aura surrounding him, I gave in. Willingly.</p> <p>My father is set to become the next governor of Georgia, and he'll use me to get there if he has to. He'll hand me over, virginity and all, to the man with the biggest bank account and political pull.</p> <p>I wanted something more.</p> <p>I wanted Levi. And I had him—until I woke up, disoriented and confused, at his mercy. He’s a bad boy, all right. A sexy, deadly assassin. And I'm the pawn torn between him and my father, two powerful men intent on destroying each other.</p> <p>I might not understand their war, but I do understand one thing: No matter who wins, I lose.</p> <p><i>Assassin’s Prey</i></p> <p>I killed my first man at the age of 12. I've been killing ever since. I thought it was all I lived for...until Abby. Until the woman I'd kidnapped became the woman I couldn't walk away from.</p> <p>She owns a piece of me I wouldn't take back, but the rest? The only way to protect her is to hold back the parts inside me that are too ugly to ever reveal. I'll keep her safe, even from me.</p> <p>And it works. We have the nights, and I hunt my way through the days. Alone.</p> <p>Until an attack reveals a threat we didn't see coming. One that could take away the dream I didn't realize I had.</p> <p>Everything. With her.</p> <p>I'm on the hunt of my life. My prey might run, but in this fight—for her, for us—they don't stand a chance.</p> <p><b>Includes a bonus scene from </b><b><i>Assassin’s Mark</i></b><b> not found in the original story!</b></p>";
