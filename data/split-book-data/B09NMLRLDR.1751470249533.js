window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>My new master is intense, intimidating, and wildly unpredictable. The only thing I can count on? That he makes me ache in ways I didn’t know were possible before he caught me in his web.</p> <p>Sterling’s secrets are of the dark and dangerous variety - there’s no doubt in my mind about that now. But I still can’t figure out what he truly wants from me. He says he’ll take what I’ve promised when “the time is right”. In the meantime, he seems determined to treat me like a naughty submissive, a princess, or his lover.</p> <p>But I can’t let myself be drawn in by his generous, wickedly sexy side. Serving Sterling is something I can survive. Falling for Sterling would destroy me - body, heart, and soul.</p> <p>Warning: <i>Serving Sterling</i> is the second installment in a three-book serial romance. It’s a dark, dirty, boundary-pushing romance that ends in a cliff-hanger.</p>";
