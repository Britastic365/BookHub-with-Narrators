Four years ago, they had a fight to end all fights, and have barely spoken since.</p> <p>Their once-passionate love match has been reduced to one of cold, detached politeness. But when Violet receives a letter that James has been thrown from his horse and rendered unconscious at their country estate, she races to be by his side - only to discover him alive and well at a tavern, and completely unaware of her concern. She’s outraged. He’s confused. And the distance between them has never been more apparent.</p> <p>Wanting to teach her estranged husband a lesson, Violet decides to feign an illness of her own. James quickly sees through it, but he decides to play along in an ever-escalating game of manipulation, featuring actors masquerading as doctors, threats of Swiss sanitariums, faux mistresses - and a lot of flirtation between a husband and wife who might not hate each other as much as they thought. Will the two be able to overcome four years of hurt, or will they continue to deny the spark between them?</p> <p>With charm, wit, and heart in spades<i>, To Have and to Hoax </i>is a fresh and eminently entertaining romantic comedy - perfect for fans of Jasmine Guillory and Julia Quinn.</p>";
