window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From <i>New York Times</i> and <i>USA Today</i> best-selling author Clarissa Wild comes a new off-the-charts novel that will make you feel filthier than ever...</b> </p> <p><i>Confess your sin.</i> </p> <p>People call me Father, but I prefer Frank, because I'm the worst preacher you'll ever meet. </p> <p>Days spent completely wasted pull a number on you, especially when you've got a truckload of baggage that comes with it. </p> <p>Until this beautiful girl in the back of the church takes my breath away. </p> <p>And we end up committing sacrilege in the confessional. </p> <p>Did I mention I'm filthy? </p> <p>Bad doesn't even begin to describe me, and after one taste of what she's got to offer, I want more. Too bad having a dirty mind isn't the only thing we've got in common... </p> <p>Our past is laced with sin. </p> <p><b>Author's Note: This audiobook is not for everyone. It's raw. It's vulgar. It's downright offensive. But it's oh so damn delicious with a capital D. If you are easily offended, please don't listen to this audiobook. But if you like a bit of humor mixed in with raunchiness and brawling, you'll love this audiobook.</b> </p>";
