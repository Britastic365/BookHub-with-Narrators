window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From author Jaymin Eve comes a new chapter in the Supernatural Prison World.... </p> <p>Maximus Compass is a vampire without direction. Without heart. And without soul. He lost his true mate in the great battle against the dragon king, and now must face life alone. </p> <p>And yet something is happening to his agony. It's fading away, leaving him with barely a memory of the female he believed to be his one and only. </p> <p>As his mind clears he starts to wonder if the mate bond had been nothing more than a manufactured ploy. This suspicion explodes within him right around the time he runs back into a certain wolf shifter. </p> <p>Mischa Lebron is a complication he doesn't need in his life. He can't erase her from his mind though, and while memories of his supposed true mate continue to fade into mere shadows, his one night with Mischa is blazingly strong. But they're not of the same supernatural race, so there's no way for a true bond to exist between them. </p> <p>Right? </p> <p>When an old threat rips apart their pack, Maximus will come to realize that he would do anything to save Mischa. That the mate he thought was perfect and precious was nothing on the shifter he walked away from. Now Maximus truly has everything to lose. </p>";
