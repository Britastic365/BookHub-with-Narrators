He always wanted out of this town and off his family's ranch. I just have to bide my time until he turns his back on all of us again.</p> <p>Then he takes on the coaching position for the high school football team and starts milling around too much, bulldozing the protective walls I've built around myself. But he goes too far when he takes my son under his wing to help him be the best player he can be. Leaving me to protect not only my own heart but my son's too.</p> <p>Because I promised myself a long time ago that I'd never be the girl in the rearview mirror again.</p>";
