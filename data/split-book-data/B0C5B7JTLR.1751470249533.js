window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I was a good girl once. But now, I dance with devils.<br> <br> Some people wear their heart on their sleeve. I wear vengeance like a suit of armor.<br> <br> I’ve got a list with six names on it. Six people who wronged me, who hurt me, who took everything from me. Six people who turned me into the monster I am now.<br> <br> And I’ve crossed off every name but one.<br> <br> One more name. One more death. Should be simple, right?<br> <br> Yeah, you’d think so. But it turns out revenge is a messy business, and when I end up in the wrong place at the wrong time, I royally piss off four brutal, twisted, gorgeous men.</p> <p>Gage, Priest, Ash, and Knox.<br> <br> Lucky for me, the last name on my list is someone they’ve got their own grudge against, so instead of killing me, they offer me a deal. They’ll give me a chance to exact my vengeance, and in exchange, all they want is me.<br> <br> I’m not stupid. I’ve played this game before. Even though they've agreed to help me, I know they want to punish me too. They want to toy with me. To let their demons loose on me.<br> <br> But maybe these Kings of Chaos have let my pretty face fool them.</p> <p>Because I'm just as vicious as they are. And I’ve got demons of my own.</p> <p>This omnibus contains the complete Dirty Broke Savages series, a dark new adult romance with enemies-to-lovers and love-hate themes, featuring a slightly psycho heroine and four even more psychotic men. It includes high steam, violence, and foul language.</p> <p>Books in this set:<br> <i>Kings of Chaos<br> Queen of Anarchy<br> Reign of Wrath <br> Empire of Ruin</i></p>";
