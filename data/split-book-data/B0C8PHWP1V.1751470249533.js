window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Shallow Hill </i>is where souls suffer slow and miserable deaths.</p> <p>When River McAllister escaped from Shallow Hill, she left her innocence behindâ€”and some of her sanity. Now, she's rebuilding her life with her dream man, and life couldn't be better.</p> <p>Ryan Fitzgerald is everything you'd want in a man. Attractive, rich, an aspiring lawyer, and would do anything to keep River. But that's not the only thing that attracts her. It's his attentiveness and possessiveness, but maybe not so much his temper.</p> <p>When her relationship takes a dark turn, Ryan's estranged brother, Mako, is the only one who sees it. He knows exactly what Ryan is capable of, and it's not the first time he had to be a knight in shining armor. </p> <p>River came from Shallow Hill, though. She's never needed saving before. What Mako doesn't see is that River is perfectly capable of taking care of herself.</p> <p>The only one who should be scared is Ryan....</p>";
