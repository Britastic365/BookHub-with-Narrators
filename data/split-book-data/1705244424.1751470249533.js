My power can unmake the gods and the worlds - but only after I mate with the demigod of sea and activate the living flame inside me.</p> <p>Mate all day and all night long.</p> <p>Peachy right?</p> <p>If only we weren't trapped in the void where no gods, demons, or mortals are safe. The monsters here? They eat immortals like us as if we're candy. It's hard to have sexy times when we're fending off titans, cannibals, nasty Ares, and that loose cannon Lucifer.</p> <p>Plus, if we don't return home before the apocalypse, Earth will turn to dust. Our only option is to let the heat of the mating fever blaze, war zone or not, and make it burn everything in its wake.</p> <p><b>Contains mature themes.</b></p>";
