The place where I rest until the end of time.</p> <p>There is only one way for me to wake from my coma. My beloved must find me and feed me her blood before I turn to ash. It's a rarity for a vampire to meet his blood mate. I knew when the coma took me, I'd die. In the dark. Alone.</p> <p>Until Maven Wildes buys my estate. Her presence at the house wakes my spirit. But not my mind.</p> <p>I want her out of my home more than I want to breathe fresh air. Unfortunately, the infuriating beautiful woman refuses to leave. Yet . . . meeting me revives a lost magic in her veins. And now breathing her in is all I want.</p> <p>Our love creates power a warlock craves. He'll spill blood to have Maven, but I'll drink his until his heart stops. I will always protect my beloved with my entire being. Even if it means spending my days in eternal night.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
