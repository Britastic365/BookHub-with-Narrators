window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Aiming for Love, Landing in Mayhem</p> <p>While Valentine’s Day is supposed to be full of romance and flying hearts, this year, Anna finds herself defending a misplaced Cupid, dodging a gang of thieving arrow shooters, and assisting Nick Bassaneli, her stubborn potential brother-in-law, with a bogus murder charge. Meanwhile, she’s trying to find her sexy boyfriend the perfect gift, when all he wants is for her to show up to Valentine’s dinner without danger on her heels.</p> <p>Speaking of danger, Aiden Devlin is a little too secretive about his newest investigation, and something is hanging heavy over his head, but the stubborn Irishman refuses to share. Anna begins to fear that the ‘bogus’ murder charge might not be so bogus, and Nick truly could be in trouble. Unfortunately for Aiden, the Albertini family is full of self-proclaimed sleuths, and they’re more than eager to crack the case before he can reach his own conclusions.</p> <p>During the season of love, Anna is forced to juggle her meddling family, solve the puzzle of the chaotic Cupids, save her potential brother-in-law, and arrive at Valentine’s Day dinner in one piece. Hey, miracles can happen.</p>";
