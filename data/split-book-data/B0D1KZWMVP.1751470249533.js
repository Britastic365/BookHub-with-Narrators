window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>An all-new and addictive dark, why-choose, captive romance from the USA Today &amp; Wall Street Journal bestselling author, Tracy Lorraine.</p> <p>I found peace in the last place I expected, but it was a mirage built on lies and unfulfilled promises.</p> <p>I thought we somehow managed to find a way to co-exist in their little lair, but as usual I was wrong.</p> <p>The second I felt settled, a corrupt Hawk turns up and flips everything I’ve come to know—and dare to trust— on its head.</p> <p>Without a choice, I’m dragged out into the night by the man I vowed to obey— Maverick Murray.</p> <p>Taken away from the protection of the man I loved to hate— Reid Harris.</p> <p>Torn from the arms of the man who’s been my savior throughout this whole ordeal— Julian Dempsey.</p> <p>They all had their reasons for needing me alive, but it was JD, the loyal best friend to the ruthless leader who taught me all about playing with fire.</p> <p>The cocky playboy who likes to think himself a joker.</p> <p>Just one smile from him and everything seems easier.</p> <p>One touch and the rest of the world falls away.</p> <p>The last thing I want to do is hurt him.</p> <p>But I can’t forget that he’s a part of all this.</p> <p>JD hurt me, even if it was with pleasure.</p> <p>I never made a secret of where my loyalties lie.</p> <p>And I have no choice but to leave him and Reid behind, as I clutch my husband’s hand, trusting that he knows best.</p> <p>But what’s best for me, is the worst thing for JD. Because without me… his darkness just might pull him under.</p> <p>Dear Listener, Lawless is book three of four in the Harrow Creek Hawks series. It is a dark why-choose romance, meaning our leading lady has several love interests and never has to choose to find her HEA. These three a-hole alphas are certainly no heroes; their morals are questionable at best. If you're looking for a good guy, then you're in the wrong place. Enter at your own discretion.</p>";
