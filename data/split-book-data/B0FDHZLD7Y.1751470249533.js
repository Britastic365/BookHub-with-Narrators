Or complications. And definitely not both in the form of a female.</p> <p>Joy is my new next-door neighbor—sweet, sexy, and entirely off-limits.<br> She always has a messy bun and a laugh that melts steel.<br> She makes my little girl giggle like I’ve never seen before.<br> She makes me burn with need.</p> <p>She’s sunshine. I’m thunderclouds.</p> <p>I tell myself I’m too gruff, too brooding, too busy being a father to want her.<br> But my wolf doesn’t care about rules. He thinks she belongs to him.<br> He knows she smells like fate… and tastes even better.</p> <p>How can I stay away? In the end, it seems fate will decide for me.</p>";
