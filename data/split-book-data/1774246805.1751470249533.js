window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>My entire life vanished the day I found my parents brutally murdered.</b></p> <p>It broke me, and everything around me came undone. I went from being a popular best-selling author to an unknown ghostwriter hiding behind my words. Nobody knows who I am now, and I want to keep it that way.</p> <p>An assignment has me pairing up with the new - and very sexy - detective on a high-profile murder case. As we dive in deeper, things spiral out of control, and the body count starts piling up. Blake and I dissect every clue, but we struggle to predict the killer’s next move. He’s always one step ahead of us in this twisted game of cat and mouse. But as the case evolves, so does my relationship with Blake, and now, I’m face-to-face with a past I’m desperate to forget.</p> <p>As we start to piece the puzzle together, everything becomes clear. It’s only a matter of time before the killer claims his next victim.</p> <p>And if he does...we lose everything.</p>";
