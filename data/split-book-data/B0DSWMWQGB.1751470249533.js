window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Abbey Lennox is legally blind…and extremely lonely. A rare form of optic neuropathy has taken most of her vision and her blindness made her a target for a killer. After barely escaping a vicious attack, she’s vowed never to take another chance on love. So when an enormous Monstrum warrior claims she is his fated mate and rightful bride, she wants nothing to do with him.<br> <br> Solon is a Chimera Monstrum with the ability to sense the emotions of those he is attuned to. When he touches Abbey’s hand, he understands that she fears him but he doesn’t know why. He only knows that he has to find a way to gain her trust and make her understand that he wants to love and protect her.<br> <br> Despite Abbey’s fear of him, Solon claims her and after some time, trust begins to grow. But when an evil from her past comes back to haunt them, will the Monstrum warrior be able to keep his new bride safe? Will Abbey escape death a second time and if so, will she allow herself to be…Chosen by the Chimera?<br> <br> <br> ***Author’s Warning—there is a pet death in this book, but it happens in the past and mostly off-screen. The female main character is also a survivor of SA, which also happens in the past and off-screen. Please listen responsibly and I promise, everything works out in the end because I would never write a book without a HEA</p>";
