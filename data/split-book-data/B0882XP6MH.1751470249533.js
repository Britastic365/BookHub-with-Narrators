window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When I arrived at Roseborne College searching for my foster brother, I had no idea what I was in for. In the past few weeks, I've endured torments both physical and emotional. I've looked death in the face. And I've made an unnerving discovery that's left me scrambling to pick up the pieces of the quest I started out on.</p> <p>But the supernatural beings who run this school haven't conquered me yet. I'll turn the tables on them with my newfound knowledge - and maybe with the help of three temptingly screwed-up guys I never expected to count on.</p> <p>At least, that's the plan. Everyone in this place is keeping secrets: Me, the guys I might be falling for, and my brother. Secrets big enough to bring us together...or to tear us completely apart. How will I find the strength to continue the fight if it turns out I can't trust anyone - not even myself? <br> </p> <p><b><i>Academy of the Forsaken</i></b><b> is the second book in a gothic paranormal trilogy with shades of </b><b><i>Beauty and the Beast</i></b><b>. If you love snarky heroines, damaged heroes, dark secrets galore, and reverse harem romance with no choosing required, look no further! Just beware: Once you enter Roseborne College, there may be no coming back....</b></p>";
