Rent coming due means I’m desperate, but not desperate enough for Travis freaking Westmister to live with me...that is, until my brother convinces me his best friend and my mortal enemy is my only hope. Now the man I gave my V-card to before he disappeared is parading around my house shirtless, toned, tanned, and ripped. </p> <p>Oh, God, I will not go there. He broke my heart, and I hate his guts - except he’s not who I thought he was at all. Now I can’t cross the line because then I won’t have a roommate - plus me and my virginity hate him. Don’t we?</p>";
