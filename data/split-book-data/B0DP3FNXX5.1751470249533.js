I follow them home and break into their rooms… like a predator ambushing unsuspecting prey. The thrill of the hunt makes me feel alive.</p> <p>But Ember isn't scared of me. She's a fighter… and when I break into her room in the dead of night, she relishes every touch.</p> <p>I know I should be done with her and move on to my next victim, but something stops me. I'm the masked man that lurks in the shadows—and she can't get enough of me.</p> <p>Every second spent watching her ignites a spark that threatens to grow into an inferno. I've already claimed her as mine… she just doesn't know it yet.</p> <p>This will be the best hunt of my life.</p>";
