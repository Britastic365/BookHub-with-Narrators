window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The sensational conclusion to the massive #1 </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling series . . .</b></p> <p>It's been over three months since my friends and I took down Cyrus. Three months where my biggest fear was what paper was due next . . . But I should have known it was too good to last. Now everything is falling apart.</p> <p>The Vampire Court has no king, the Dragon Court has no heart, and the Gargoyle Court has me—a teenager in way over her head. And it's the worst possible timing, because a threat is brewing just as the Circle is collapsing.</p> <p>I have no choice but to return to the Shadow Realm and face the terrifying queen who nearly ended us . . . and make a deal with her to save Mekhi. But this time, I'm bringing my powerful friends with me—and Hudson. Except something is wrong with him, too. He's keeping a secret—even from me.</p> <p>All I know is that everyone's life hangs in the balance. And it's my fault—because I still owe the Crone a favor . . . and now she's come to collect.</p>";
