window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"If Jena knew anything from growing up in a town full of shapeshifters, it was this: Everything changed.\" </p> <p>From Elizabeth Hunter, author of the best-selling Elemental Mysteries, comes the first novel in the new Cambio Springs Mysteries, <i>Shifting Dreams</i>. </p> <p>Somedays Jena Crowe just can't get a break. Work at her diner never ends, her two boys are bundles of energy, and she's pretty sure her oldest is about to shift into something furry or feathery. Added to that, changes seem to be coming to the tiny town of Cambio Springs, big changes that not everyone in the isolated town of shapeshifters is thrilled about. Caleb Gilbert was looking for change, and the quiet desert town seemed just the ticket for a more peaceful life. He never counted on violence finding him, nor could he have predicted just how crazy his new life would become. When murder rocks their small community, Caleb and Jena will have to work together. And when the new Chief of Police isn’t put off by any of her usual defenses, Jena may be faced with the most frightening change of all: lowering the defenses around her carefully guarded heart.</p>";
