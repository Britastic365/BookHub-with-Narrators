There's something darker and more sinister haunting the forest.</p> <p>And worse, the fae queen and Captain Hook are ready to fight for control of Neverland and they will stop at nothing to get what they want.</p> <p>War is brewing—can the Never King get his shadow back and assume his rightful throne? And if he does, where will I fit?</p> <p>Or will all of Neverland be in jeopardy right along with my dark, twisted heart?</p> <p>NOTE: <i>The Dark One</i> is book two in the Vicious Lost Boys series. It is a dark reimagining of <i>Peter and Wendy</i>. If you like your enemies-to-lovers romance with hot, ruthless, morally gray love interests, you’ll enjoy <i>The Dark One</i>. You can expect an island with darkness and secrets and no true hero in sight, with a found family atmosphere, and \"touch her and I’ll unalive you\" vibes. <i>The Dark One</i> ends on a cliff-hanger. </p> <p>Please check the author's website for CWs.</p>";
