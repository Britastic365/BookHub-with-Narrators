window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I’m in love with a villain. Ice-cold smile, shiny collection of scalpels, and he’s ravenous to use them on me. </p> <p>Joke's on you, mad scientist. I've been trying to cut this sickness out of me since forever. Not all scars are in a place that you can see. </p> <p>In your frigid alien embrace, I've found myself, so why the hesitation in those pretty silver eyes? You’re the big bad conqueror. I’m just an ordinary human. Right? Put me in your maze. Let the experiments begin... </p> <p>Contains unique alien shifters, fierce passion, and fated mates who defy everything to be together! Although it continues plot lines from the previous novels, this complete, self-contained, epic happily-ever-after can be listened to as a stand-alone. </p> <p>Trigger warning: Suicide, self-harm, medical trauma</p>";
