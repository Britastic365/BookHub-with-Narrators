window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>“I’m pretty sure he likes d!ck. Now I just need to make him realize it.”</p> <p>Liver. F--kboy extraordinaire. Race car driver. Cocky. Horny. Would kill for his best friend.</p> <p>Knox. Kickboxer with a chip on his shoulder and a heart condition. Crybaby. Would get rid of a body for his best friend.</p> <p>Both: Wanted for questioning in connection to a murder.</p> <p>Both: Possibly-maybe in love with each other and too dumb to see it.</p> <p>Liv never meant to kill anyone. It was an accident. What was he supposed to do when his best friend’s life was at stake? As much as Knox appreciates the whole saving his life thing, they’re now wanted by the cops, on the run, homeless, hungry, and miserable. At least they have each other.</p> <p>They hope to find shelter in a vast junkyard, instead they witness a crime and are about to get dunked in acid. But they’ve overheard that the owner of the place shelters gay guys. So Liv does the most logical thing. He pretends to be Knox’s boyfriend to get their lives spared. Knox might not like it, but what choice do they have once they started lying?</p> <p>Only that touching Knox starts an avalanche of new feelings and desires Liv never anticipated. His dick is on board even before his brain is. Now, all he needs to do is convince Knox that there’s nothing wrong in exploring this new attraction. Sadly, Knox can be as stubborn as he is pretty, but Liv wasn’t called the trailer park prince for nothing. He’ll do whatever it takes to make Knox see the light. And by light, he means his dick.</p> <p>WARNING: This story contains scenes of violence, offensive language, and morally gray characters.</p>";
