Even worse? He claims I’m a spy for the vampires and drags me to the fortified Shifter City. </p> <p>After dumping me at a shifter military academy, he thinks he can forget about me. Only he underestimates his hot and heavy lust for me. </p> <p>And I listen to his sweet, vicious lies and let him act on his urges. Afterward, he goes back to his fiancée, who wants me dead more than the air she breathes. </p> <p>When I try to escape, Jared punishes me and locks me up. But there’s something he doesn’t know - that not even I know. A formidable vampire god has been hunting for his destined bride for over a century. </p> <p>Me. </p> <p>And Marlowe kills anyone who gets in his way.</p>";
