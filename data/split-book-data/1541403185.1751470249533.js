What would you choose?</b></p> <p>One night to drown all the pain is all it's supposed to be...Or so we thought. We thought wrong. Life kicks us in the teeth.</p> <p>Beautiful. Intriguing. Strong. Independent. Everything a man like me craves in a woman, Rylynn has. Except she's Rhys' daughter. He's made it clear within the brotherhood that she's off limits. But rules are meant to be broken. It's a specialty of mine. She's a young woman, but her eyes spark with knowledge beyond her 19 years. She's my strength and my biggest weakness. She's also the first person I ever held who meant more than my cut.</p> <p>Cocky. Self-assured. Confident. Skilled. Crow is the President of the Ravage Motorcycle Club Rebellion Chapter. Therefore, forbidden to me and much older. Those facts make him even hotter. The way he commands the space, all alpha bad boy biker, is enthralling and grips that broken part of me that weeps for the loss of my grandfather. He is the solace when all is lost. He's also the only person who's been able to calm my soul.</p> <p>We both need each other. The connection is too strong to ignore.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
