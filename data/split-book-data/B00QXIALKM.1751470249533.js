window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Jericho isn't the famous rock star he once was, though he still plays in a local band and loves to party. Beautiful women come and go, but music is his only passion - until a sassy redhead named Isabelle Monroe shows up unexpectedly. Izzy has always loved the freedom and adventure of life on the road, but she has recently decided to settle down-as much as a rogue wolf can. When her boyfriend gets her a job working at a hot Shifter bar, she runs into the last person on earth she expected to see again. Old habits die hard, and sometimes the toughest addictions to shake are the ones that control our hearts.</p>";
