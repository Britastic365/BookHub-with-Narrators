window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>First, they stole her house. Then, they stole her pub. Now, these three irresistible brothers might just steal her heart.</b></p> <p>When her mentor kicks the bucket, Isla's dream of owning her beloved Highland pub crashes and burns, landing in the laps of three sinfully tempting American brothers. There's Theo, the grumpy one whose scowls make her want to climb him like a tree. Henry, the rugged heartbreaker whose mouth should come with a warning label. And Dylan, the adorkable numbers guy hiding a devil behind those glasses. They may own her pub, but she owns something better: the recipe for their undoing.</p> <p>Now, Isla is building her own brewery, determined to serve up revenge with a side of success. But between Theo's heated glances, Henry's wicked promises, and Dylan's unexpected wild side, she's discovering that revenge isn't as tempting as it once was. The line between enemies and lovers is disappearing faster than a shot of whisky, and Isla's starting to wonder what it'll feel like to get burned.</p> <p>They said to keep your enemies close, but Isla was pretty sure they didn't mean <i>this </i>close.</p>";
