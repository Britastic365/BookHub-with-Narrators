window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>You're Just Another Sacrifice…</i></b></p> <p>Isabel thought she had everything under control when she secured an invitation to Ebonridge’s most elite—and dangerous—event, <i>Latibulum Noctis</i>. She was there for one reason: to help her friend Valeria.</p> <p>She had no idea she was walking straight into a trap.</p> <p>When the Whitmore brothers kidnap her as part of a twisted ritual, she’s thrust into their web of lies, power, and deadly games.</p> <p>Theodore, Maxwell, and Julian have always been focused on securing their futures, bound by the dark legacy of their family. But after the night the Whitmore estate went up in flames, they find themselves unable to let Isabel go.</p> <p>What was meant to be a sacrifice becomes an obsession, a dangerous attraction neither side can deny.</p> <p>Isabel hates them, seeing only the monsters in their eyes. But the more she learns, the more they worm their way under her skin. With every touch, every secret shared, the lines between captor and captive blur, and the lust that simmers between them becomes impossible to resist.</p> <p>In a world of dark desire, pleasure, and betrayal, Isabel must decide how far she’s willing to fall—and how much she’s willing to lose—before the Whitmore adoptive brothers claim her completely.</p> <p><i>Silent Oaths</i> is a dark, why-choose romance with forced proximity, enemies-to-lovers tension, touch-her-and-die protectiveness, and morally grey antiheroes. Featuring a kidnapped heroine, secret societies, dangerous family legacies, and a slow-burn obsession, this book is perfect for listeners who love high-stakes romance with betrayal, loyalty, and forbidden attraction.</p>";
