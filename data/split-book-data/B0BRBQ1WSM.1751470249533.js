She's the woman who thinks <i>The Goonies</i> is a horror movie and lives for Austen-era romance novels.</p> <p>So, when a night out of her comfort zone ends up in a nightmarish elevator, all the risks she never took spill to the stranger in the corner: actually see <i>The Goonies</i>, ride a rollercoaster, and get that heart-melting kiss people will write books about.</p> <p>She didn't expect the smoldering guy with tattoos to step up and knock one of those things off her list.</p> <p>They survive. Hearts melt. He leaves without giving his name.</p> <p>Until a school assembly is hosted by the rock band from the concert, and Rees Hayden, the bassist who rarely cracks a smile, bears an uncanny resemblance to the man in the elevator.</p> <p>Turns out, Vienna kissed a rock star. And he isnâ€™t even close to done with her yet. When opposites attract will it be the perfect match? Or will the good girl and rocker bad boy end in the perfect disaster?</p>";
