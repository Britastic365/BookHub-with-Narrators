window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A gripping and heartfelt horror-tinged space adventure from the BSFA award-winning author of Stars and Bones and Embers and Becky Chambers. Listeners of James S.A. Core will love this fast-paced story of space piracy, deadly alien artifacts and a race to save what is left of humanity.<br> <br> When archaeologist Ursula Morrow accidentally infects herself with an alien parasite, she fears she may have jeopardised her career. However, her concerns become irrelevant when Earth is destroyed, billions die, and suddenly no one needs archaeologists anymoreâ€¦<br> <br> Two years later, she's plucked from a refugee camp on a backwater world and tasked with retrieving the artifact that infected her, as it just might hold the key to humanity's survival. With time running short, and the planet housing the weapon now situated in hostile territory, she realises she's going to have to commit an act of desperate piracy if she's going to achieve her objective before the enemy's final onslaught.<br> <br> A thrilling journey into deep space where the fights are brutal, the relationships are complicated and the world ended years ago.</p>";
