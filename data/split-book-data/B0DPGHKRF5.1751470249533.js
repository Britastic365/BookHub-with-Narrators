It is slow-burn and slow-build and has enemies-to-lovers themes (though no bullying). The men of this series are psychotic, possessive, and deranged antiheroes who take what they want, when they want it, regardless of the consequences. They care about absolutely no one... except for the FMC, though they'll have to work hard to win her over.</i></p>";
