window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I wasn't supposed to be found. </p> <p>After my father's murder, my mother broke with the Jacksonville Pack and became a lone wolf, retreating to the swamp to hide a secret she was determined to keep from the world - me. I grew up there, in the lush but dangerous no man's land populated by ogres, panthers, and bog hags. </p> <p>I've never spoken to a living soul but my mother when the Alpha of the Jacksonville Pack shows up claiming we share the rarest of bonds, that of True Mates. Apparently, my inexperience and lack of social skills do not make for a good match, and he promptly severs our bond and throws me back to the swamps. </p> <p>Broken and alone, I've all but given up hope when a strange man drags me from the weeds and brings me home to meet his two rough, biker brothers. Cast from the pack for challenging its Alpha, the triplets are lone wolves like me. They don't laugh at my lack of manners or knowledge of the world. </p> <p>They care for me. They heal me. And they teach me all I've been missing while hidden away in the swamp. </p> <p>But sinister forces are watching, waiting to stake their claim on my life the way they did my father's. Are these three lone wolves strong enough to save me from the same fate he met? </p> <p><i>Banished from the Pack</i> is book one in a trilogy of steamy, near-future paranormal romances with an innocent, sheltered heroine and multiple tough, protective mates who share her love. She does not choose between them. It has steamy scenes intended for audiences over 18.</p>";
