window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The love of my life has betrayed me. A past love I forgot has returned. And they both want me back. So, what do I do? Run off to solve a brand-new ancient mystery, of course!</b> </p> <p>Nia Rivers knows better than anyone that immortality comes at a terrible cost. After all, she’s lost entire centuries - and a past relationship - from her memory. So, when she hears the Greek gods have found a way to give eternal life to mortals, she heads to Athens to investigate the rumors of a cult of Demeter. What she finds are clues that suggest her own past is entwined in the rituals.</p> <p>Now, with the help of her bestie Loren, Nia must once again unearth the truth. Are the Olympians the villains of this chapter in history or the benevolent benefactors they claim to be? Her anguish over Zane’s betrayal and her conflicting feelings for Tres prove a painful distraction. But if Nia can't get her head in the game, the Titans will rise again, and the souls of all humans on Earth will be at risk.</p> <p>And that’s a little more important than Nia’s love life. For now, at least. </p> <p><b>Get this hot urban fantasy featuring spine-tingling adventure, twists on historical mysteries, and thrilling romance, where </b><b><i>Tomb Raider </i></b><b>meets</b><b><i> Indiana Jones</i></b><b> - and they live forever!</b></p>";
