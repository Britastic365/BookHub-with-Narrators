Will a guard make the right choice? </p> <p>Becky needs a scoop to make her mark in the journalism world and gets her chance when she’s hired as a nurse for a top-secret clinic hidden in the Rockies. What she doesn’t expect is to become one of the patients and kept prisoner.</p> <p>The doctors are playing God and have found a way to change people. Change them into something else. In her case, she becomes a mermaid. The only one of her kind and about to be sold to the highest bidder unless she can convince the man guarding her to set her free.</p> <p>Jett ain’t no hero, yet, he finds himself rescuing Becky, over and over. Even starts liking the talkative nurse, which is a bad idea. He knows better than to get involved with a woman. Didn’t his daddy teach him love always hurts?</p> <p>It hurts, alright, especially because he ends up having to make a choice; doing his job or protecting Becky.</p> <p>Is it even possible for a man to love a mermaid? Might be time to take some scuba diving lessons to find out.</p>";
