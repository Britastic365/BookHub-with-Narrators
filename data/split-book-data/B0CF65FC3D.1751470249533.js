window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Passion's magic ignites a fire too hot to touch-—nd too wicked to die . . .</p> <p>The stars have always called to Ailis, beckoning her to see what other realms were out there. She's told it's impossible, but that doesn't stop her need to explore beyond what others believe. Ailis never expected to change history by creating the first doorway to another realm. She certainly never imagined opening that door to find a commanding dragon who shifts into a man. She's irresistibly drawn to Lennox, powerless against the yearning of her body and the longing of her heart.</p> <p>Magic might have chosen Lennox as King of Dragon Kings, but it's a position he's never wanted. Until the day a new being arrives—and irrevocably changes his life. The closer he gets to the fearless, ravishing woman, the more he fights the passion that flares between them. He lives only for his duty, but one fiery kiss unleashes a firestorm of desire that will ripple across eons and realms. Fate might have brought them together, but will it also tear them apart?</p> <p>The origins of the Dark Kings/Dragon Kings and the entire Dark Universe is finally revealed.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
