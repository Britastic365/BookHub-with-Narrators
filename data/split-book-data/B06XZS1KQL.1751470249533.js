window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Take all the suspense and sexual tension of <i>The X-Files</i>, combine it with the charm and antics of <i>Supernatural</i>, and you get <i>Darkhouse</i>. Well, not quite. </p> <p>Dex and Perry might have the chemistry of Mulder and Scully and the scares of the Winchester Brothers, but I promise you this duo is unlike anything you've seen before. </p> <p>When 23-year-old Perry Palomino explores a supposedly haunted lighthouse, she runs into Youtuber Dex Foray, a sexy, snarky, and opportunistic ghost hunter who doesn't quite believe in ghosts. What Dex does believe in is making money and in Perry he sees a viable opportunity: create a ghost-hunting show on YouTube that would rival anything you'd see on TV and watch the dollars roll in. </p> <p>But creating and filming a ghost-hunting show isn't easy when there are actual ghosts haunting them - and then some. Sometimes terrifying, often hilarious, <i>Darkhouse</i> is the first book in the Experiment in Terror series. </p>";
