window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>She sacrificed herself to save him. He’ll sacrifice everything to get her back.</i></p> <p>Davin wakes up after the best night of his life to find his fiancée missing, his cousin dead, and a murder accusation hanging over his head. He is determined to track Galina down, even if fleeing means he’ll take the blame for a crime he didn’t commit.</p> <p>But each step he takes after Galina brings him closer to unraveling the lies she left in her wake. Between the corpses left by the rebellion and the woman whose motives he trusts less every day, Davin will have to decide between saving her and saving his kingdom.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Galina is living her worst nightmare, ensnared by the monster she sacrificed her entire future to escape. Her only protection from the rebels who want to see her dead is a man who wants to own her – a man who may very well succeed.</p> <p>She is resigned to the choices she’s made to keep Davin safe until he catches up to her on the road, threatening to ruin everything she has worked so hard to preserve.</p> <p>With the secrets festering between them both and the Viper out to destroy everything they love, they’ll have to find a way to trust one another long enough to survive.</p> <p>Fragile Oath is the conclusion to Davin and Galina’s slow burn, second chance love story, full of angst, humor, and redemption with a hard won happily ever after. The Lochlann Deception Duology, perfect for fans of Danielle Jensen, Elise Kova, and Sarah J Maas.</p>";
