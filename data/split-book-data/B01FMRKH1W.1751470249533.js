window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A <i>USA Today</i> best seller. </p> <p><b>Warning:</b> This book contains some very disturbing situations, graphic violence, strong language, and sexual content. For listeners over 18 years. </p> <p>Love is like an avalanche. It hits hard, fast, and without mercy. At least it did for me when Sculpt, the lead singer of the rock band Tear Asunder, knocked me off my feet - literally. Because he's also a fighter, illegally of course, and he taught me how to fight. He also taught me how to love, and I fell hard for him. I mean, the guy could do sweet when he wasn't doing bossy, and I like sweet. </p> <p>Then it all shattered. Kidnapped. Starved. Beaten. I was alone and fighting to survive. When I heard Sculpt's voice, I thought he was there to save me. I was wrong. </p>";
