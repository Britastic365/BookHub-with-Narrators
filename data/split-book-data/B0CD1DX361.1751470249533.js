window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"A steamy game of cat and mouse between witch and witch-hunter, played out against a backdrop of opulence, secrets, and bloody history. I couldn't look away.\" - Kendare Blake, #1 </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author of </b><b><i>Champion of Fate</i></b></p> <p><b>Enemies-to-lovers doesn't get more high stakes than a witch and a witch hunter falling in love in bestselling author Kristen Ciccarelli's latest romantic fantasy</b><br> <br> On the night Rune’s life changed forever, blood ran in the streets. Now, in the aftermath of a devastating revolution, witches have been diminished from powerful rulers to outcasts ruthlessly hunted due to their waning magic, and Rune must hide what she is.<br> <br> Spending her days pretending to be nothing more than a vapid young socialite, Rune spends her nights as the Crimson Moth, a witch vigilante who rescues her kind from being purged. When a rescue goes wrong, she decides to throw the witch hunters off her scent and gain the intel she desperately needs by courting the handsome Gideon Sharpe - a notorious and unforgiving witch hunter loyal to the revolution - who she can't help but find herself falling for.<br> <br> Gideon loathes the decadence and superficiality Rune represents, but when he learns the Crimson Moth has been using Rune’s merchant ships to smuggle renegade witches out of the republic, he inserts himself into her social circles by pretending to court her right back. He soon realizes that beneath her beauty and shallow façade, is someone fiercely intelligent and tender who feels like his perfect match. Except, what if she’s the very villain he’s been hunting?<br> <br> Kristen Ciccarelli’s<i> Heartless Hunter</i> is the thrilling start to a romantic fantasy duology where the only thing more treacherous than being a witch...is falling in love.<br> <br> <b>“Enchanting and deeply romantic, </b><b><i>Heartless Hunter</i></b><b> drew me in with the first sentence and left me breathless by the last. A story that unfolds like a spell, and one that is destined to capture your heart.” - Rebecca Ross, </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author of </b><b><i>Divine Rivals</i></b></p>";
