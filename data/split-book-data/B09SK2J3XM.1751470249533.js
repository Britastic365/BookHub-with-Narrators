window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When tragedy struck, the loss of Jordan and Wren’s shared lover ripped them apart. </p> <p>Guilt and shame made it impossible for Agent Jordan Mikalski to look the love of his life in the eye. If he couldn’t face her, he sure as hell couldn’t live with her or make love to her or even be the man to comfort her in the depths of her grief. </p> <p>Wren Asbery’s mourning threw her into a deep depression she wasn’t sure she’d ever climb out of, made worse by Jordan’s abandonment in the time of her greatest need. For that she’ll never forgive that bastard. </p> <p>After years of slow healing, they realize they’re both attracted to the same man, which means they have some things to figure out fast. Will Kason Cox be doomed to lust after two people who can’t stand each other, or will he be able to become the glue that sticks them back together? </p> <p><b>This is a stand-alone book in the Hot Rides series and includes a happily ever after with no cheating. The series is part of the greater universe where both the Powertools and Hot Rods books are also set, so you can visit with many of your previous favorite characters and see what they’re up to now!</b></p>";
