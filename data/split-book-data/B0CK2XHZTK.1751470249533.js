I couldn't stop now, even if I wanted to—which I don't.</p> <p>He thinks our conversations are more than just sex. He's wrong. The intimacy he feels is all a facade. Until the day an embodiment of my darkest fantasies walks into my bar, and his unmistakable voice sends a shiver down my spine.</p> <p>It turns out I'm not the one in control. But when he calls tonight, and he will, I'll be ready… with a lie.</p> <p><b>Zuko</b></p> <p>My job is to hunt. Dispose of problems like they never existed. And I'm incredibly good at my job. It's brutal and violent. But, then again, so I am. I crave destruction. Death is merely a consequence of my dark pursuits. And I won't lose a wink of sleep over it, either.</p> <p>Nothing bothers me. No one affects me. Except the vixen with the lilac hair. When I reveal my true self to her, she laughs it off, enticed by the game we play.</p> <p>She's keeping secrets.
