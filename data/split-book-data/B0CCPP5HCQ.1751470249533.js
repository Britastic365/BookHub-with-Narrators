window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Books 11-13 in the <i>USA Today</i> best-selling Dead Cold series from two-million best-selling author Blake Banner.</p> <ul> <li><i>Murder Most Scottish</i> (book 11)</li> <li><i>The Butcher of Whitechapel</i> (book 12)</li> <li><i>Little Dead Riding Hood</i> (book 13)</li> </ul> <p>When detectives John Stone and Carmen Dehan, who run the Cold Cases Department at the 43rd Precinct in the Bronx, choose their honeymoon together, there are three things they are very clear on: There must be good steak and whisky, it must be remote, and they must forget about work, cold cases, and murder for two weeks.</p> <p>So a small island off the north coast of Scotland in a 16th-century castle seems to be just the job. After all, two out of three isn’t bad. At first, the place seems idyllic–the wild landscapes are breathtaking, the northern lights otherworldly, and the fireside talk, fuelled by good whisky and good Angus steak, is fascinating.</p> <p>Maybe a bit too fascinating when it leads to a 40-year-old mystery about a man murdered, shot with a .38 in a locked room in circumstances that are, quite simply, impossible. And when the island is cut off by a storm and an identical murder is committed, well, what are two cold case cops on honeymoon to do?</p>";
