window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Some rules were made to be broken.</p> <p>Layla Corbin loves her life as a technician on the deep space asteroid-mining ship <i>Kessel Queen</i>. Great job, great companions, great money. Perfect, except she wants all four of her sexy crewmates. The rules of the ship state she can only have one - an impossible choice.</p> <p>When Mace issued that order, he did it to protect his crew. He never imagined that theyâ€™d all fall for Layla. </p> <p>Note from the author: This is the story that started it all. The first story I set in the Drift Universe, home of both the Drift and Nova Force series. This version of <i>Blind Bet</i> is a rerelease with a new cover and revised/expanded content. <i>Blind Bet</i> is a stand-alone romance. </p>";
