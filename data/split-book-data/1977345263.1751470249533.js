But she won't reveal any more to these renegade feds than she has to. Especially not to Raider Tanaka, her control freak of a bodyguard and handler. It's enough that his body is tensed for action and his heated gaze is always on her....</p> <p>Too sharp. Raider knows there's more to his new assignment than he's been told. Why send a deadly agent of his experience to guard a computer genius - even a gorgeous, unpredictable, undisciplined one? But when Brigid's estranged father is named in an investigation into Boston's organized crime, Raider's mind switches onto high alert, just like his senses....</p> <p>Too close. To clear her father's name, Brigid needs Raider's help. The unit's idea that she bring a straight-laced fed in as her \"fiance\" won't fly, though-not unless Raider can release his inner bad boy and become the rebel Brigid can't resist....</p>";
