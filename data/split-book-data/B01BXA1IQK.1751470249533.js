window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Lily: To escape my uncle - one of New York's most dangerous mob bosses - I had to create a whole new life. I became an expert forger, fled to Texas, and never let anyone get close to me again. I didn't figure on having my life saved by a huge, muscled cowboy. He's arrogant, he's stubborn, and he's the local stud, so why is he interested in a curvy girl like me? And if he annoys me so much, why can't I stop fantasizing about him? </p> <p>Bull: As soon as I saw her, I knew I had to have her. Lily had curves that didn't quit and too many goddamn secrets. Well, I was going to uncover every inch of her.... </p> <p>Contains mature themes. </p>";
