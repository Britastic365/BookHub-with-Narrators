window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>What do you do when your friend’s planet runs out of women? Join them for takeout, of course.</i></p> <p>Radek is a prince with a problem. He wants to see the galaxy, but an ancient law forbids any member of the Romaki Dragon Clans from ever leaving their planet. So, what’s a Romaki Snow dragon to do? Defy the law, hop a ride with a friend, and head for the far side of the galaxy, that’s what.</p> <p>As the Pyrosians prepare to claim their mates, all Radek has to do is sit back, enjoy the party, and keep one little promise - no shifting into a dragon while he’s visiting Earth. What could be simpler?</p> <p>This book contains a sassy chef, whose dreams just went up in flames, and a runaway prince who came to Earth looking for answers - and found his destiny instead. </p>";
