window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Destined to be together, forbidden to love, two lost souls fight evil in an everyday world that belongs to the night. A dark romantasy by a </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>USA Today</i></b><b> bestselling author.</b></p> <p>Aria Rialta is a girl of two realities. One she was born to. The other she was chosen for. Both are a threat.</p> <p>Every night when Aria falls asleep, she enters the nightmare world of Faydor to fight a war. It’s her calling to help destroy the Kruen, who feed sin and chaos to our everyday world of vulnerable humans. It would be a lonely realm in which to do battle if not for Pax, Aria’s dangerously irresistible soulmate whose mere touch can kill. It’s also a realm that’s getting harder to escape.</p> <p>Aria’s hallucinations are seeping into her waking world. And the Kruen are coming for her. To help Aria, Pax must do what no one in Faydor has dared to do before—join his soulmate in the light of day. Giving in to their forbidden attraction could be the death of them, but they might not be able to stop themselves as they embark on a cross-country journey to fight the evils hunting them.</p> <p>As their desire grows, so do Aria’s untapped powers, and a menacing new force far darker than the Kruen.</p>";
