window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A Baseball Romcom Box Set</b></p> <p><b>Meet the Copper Valley Fireballs, baseball's lovable losers whose hot heroes are determined to turn this team around and resisting finding love along the way! </b>This box set includes four full-length romantic comedies and a bonus novella.<br> <br> <b>About the books:<br> <br> </b><b><i>Jock Blocked</i></b> is a home run of a feel-good romantic comedy featuring the world’s most superstitious sports fan, baseball’s oldest virgin hero, a rogue meatball, an adorable puppy with a cussing problem, and a happily ever after more satisfying than a game-winning grand slam.<br> <br> <b><i>Real Fake Love</i></b> is a line drive straight to the heart featuring a grumpy athlete, a jilted bride, a fake relationship, and the world’s laziest cat. It stands alone and comes complete with sibling rivalry, the world’s most awkward shower scene, and a sweetly satisfying happily ever after.<br> <br> <b><i>The Grumpy Player Next Door</i></b><b> </b>is a fun-filled enemies-to-lovers romcom featuring a ray of sunshine on a mission, an athlete who’s only grouchy around her, and an epic prank gone wrong. It stands alone and comes complete with small-town shenanigans, a goat who’s not nearly as wise as his name suggests, and proof that sometimes, love is the best kind of vengeance.<br> <br> <b><i>Irresistible Trouble</i></b><b> </b>is a hilarious grand slam of a romcom about a baseball player whose ego is catching up to him, a pop star who’s a bit of a hot mess when the cameras aren’t looking (and sometimes when they are), and the kind of family and teammates that everyone deserves… in small doses.<br> <br> <b><i>Have Yourself a Grumpy Little Christmas</i></b><b> </b>is a hit of holiday sweetness featuring a grumpy retired baseball pitcher who hates the holidays, his best friend's little sister, and a Christmas tree mishap.</p>";
