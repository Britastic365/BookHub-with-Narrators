window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The <i>New York Times</i> Best Seller <i>With You</i>. </p><p>Do not listen if you are sensitive to disturbing scenes, as the next novel, <i>Torn from You</i>, is a very dark romance. </p><p>Sculpt is an illegal fighter. <br>He's also the lead singer of a local rock band. <br>No one knows his real name. <br>And from the moment I met him, he made me forget mine. </p><p>In order to convince Sculpt to give me self-defense lessons, I had to follow his one rule: no complaining, or he'd walk. I didn't think it would be a problem. I could handle a few bruises. What I hadn't anticipated was landing on my back with Sculpt on top of me and my entire body burning up for him. </p><p>I tried to ignore it. I failed, of course. And having a hot, tattooed badass on top of me week after week, acting completely immune to what he was doing to me - it was frustrating as hell, so I broke his rule. I complained. Then he kissed me. </p><p>Author's note: This novella is a prequel. Listening to it before <i>Torn from You</i> is not required but is highly recommended. </p><p>Warning: huge cliffhanger. Like huge! However, <i>With You</i> is released on the same day as <i>Torn from You</i> the novel. </p><p>Due to sexual content and strong language, not recommended for listeners under 18. </p>";
