window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>One of the scariest vampires in Midnight Harbor loves me. </p> <p>I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing, but I'm not going to look too closely at it. Not when secrets are coming out about my past and a rival vampire is hellbent on not only possessing me, but my sister too. </p> <p>If I want to survive the secrets and plotting, I'm going to need Bran Duval by my side. Having him in my bed is just a bonus. </p> <p><b>NOTE: </b><b><i>Hot Vampire Next Door</i></b><b> is first and foremost a serial. This version is a boxset of season three episodes and contains episodes 34 to 53. The story is considered ongoing and does not have a scheduled end date. You can expect high heat, lots of twists, and a vampire who realizes he might be a little more protective of his little mouse than he first realized.</b></p> <p><b>Please check the author's website for CWs/TWs.</b></p>";
