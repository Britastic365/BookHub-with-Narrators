Not for a lifetime, just for one night.</b></p> <p>But as sure as I am that one night between us would rock both of our worlds, he's equally as sure that the two of us are a horrible idea...until he needs me. One week, a fake relationship, and an offer I can't refuse.</p> <p>The pet names? <i>Bogus.</i></p> <p>The details of our whirlwind romance? <i>Completely fabricated.</i></p> <p>The way he kisses me? <i>That feels way too real.</i></p> <p>Faking it with Liam is way too easy and forgetting why I'm here is effortless. I only have two jobs. Convincing everyone else we're in love and convincing myself we're not. But it's not that simple. He makes it easy to forget he's practically paying me to be his girlfriend.</p> <p>Too easy to forget that we aren't real.</p> <p>It's one week and my heart on the line.</p> <p>Everything was supposed to be fake. The rules perfectly clear, but I was in <i>Trouble with the Fake Boyfriend</i>.</p>";
