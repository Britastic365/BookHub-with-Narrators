But who’s bragging? </p> <p>I’m right on my way to retirement behind the pearly gates. Everything was going fine...until the Risk Witches saw a terrible vision. </p> <p>Three men. Each scarred in their own way, born with powers that haven’t been seen in eons. </p> <p>Upper management sent the best to correct their path. Angels. Poltergeists. Nothing worked.</p> <p>These men were too stubborn. Too bad. Too untamed....</p> <p><i>So they sent me.</i></p> <p>Roman. Ezra. Dorian.</p> <p>Combined, they have enough power to end the world—and they will.</p> <p>Unless I find a way to stop them first.</p> <p><b>Breaking people is my job.
