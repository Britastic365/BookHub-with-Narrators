window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>I was just a boy when the monsters rose on earth, forcing humans to flee to the coastlines and live in cramped, dirty, military-controlled cities. I enlisted as soon as I could to escape.</b></p> <p>Now, I’ve been in the military for twelve years and have the scars—and missing body parts—to prove it. As a hardened soldier who’s spent his fair share of time out in the Wastes—the dangerous place where monsters roam free—I didn’t think anything could surprise me anymore.</p> <p>But then circumstance forced me together with a big, annoying purple monster who’s arrogant and bossy and pushes all my buttons in the worst—and best—ways. I need his help, and I <i>hate </i>needing anyone’s help. But the more time I spend with him, the more I realise that maybe there’s more from him that I need... and that he might need things from me too.</p> <p>But I’m still a soldier. I still have responsibilities. It doesn’t matter how I feel about Edin, because we can’t be together. It’s too dangerous. That doesn’t stop me wanting him, though.</p> <p><i>Edin </i>is book two of the Monstrous series, a post-apocalyptic m/m fantasy series that focuses on monsters and human men falling in love. The story contains explicit content, including graphic depictions of torture and violence, and mentions PTSD.</p>";
