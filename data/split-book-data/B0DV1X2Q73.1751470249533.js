window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>I wasn't born with a silver spoon in my mouth. Mine was gold, diamond-encrusted, and held in place by household staff.</b></p> <p>With a trust fund I'd never be able to blow through, I didn't need to work a day in my life. I sure as hell didn't need the kind of job I had.</p> <p>But I wasn't in it for the money. It was for personal satisfaction. A love of a job well done. What's that saying about never working a day in your life if you love breaking fingers and burying bodies where they'll never be found?</p> <p>I might be paraphrasing, but it was still the truth.</p> <p>My boss' wife called me a goon—and she wasn't wrong. As second-in-command, I did whatever was needed to keep Black Resorts running smoothly. That often included the aforementioned violence since Vegas wasn't short on people who deserved it.</p> <p>The rarity was those who deserved protection. Like Mila. Liar. Thief. And my little ray of pessimistic sunshine.</p> <p>Her spoon wasn't silver. Hell, it wasn't even a spoon. It was a plastic spork that she hustled and fought for, and she'd always done it alone. But that changed the second she nearly passed out in my arms.</p> <p>She called me a behemoth.</p> <p>I wanted her to call me Daddy.</p> <p><i>From </i>USA Today<i> bestselling author Layla Frost comes a steamy age-gap romance about finding acceptance, mutual obsession, and a behemoth with a giant… heart. This story features a heroine in need of some TLC and a gooey cinna-Dom-roll Daddy who is up for the challenge. It can be enjoyed as a standalone.</i></p>";
