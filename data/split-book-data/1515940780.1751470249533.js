It's not like this is the first time he's been forced to start over. But 17 years of city living hasn't prepared him for life in the suburbs...or for Layla Warren.</p> <p>Layla is smart, funny, beautiful...the kind of girl every guy dreams about. Trip should know. He's been falling for her since the first minute he saw her. And his life hasn't been the same since.</p> <p>Prepare to travel back to your teen years...that time in your life before the real world kicked in, that limbo between adolescence and adulthood, that trial of hanging onto the past while figuring out where the future will lie.
