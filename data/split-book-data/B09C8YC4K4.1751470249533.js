window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I’ve been waiting my whole life to get my wolf. But now that the time is here, I need to run. Three years ago, a nightmare of an alpha took over my pack by force, and ever since, he’s been trying to do the same to me.</p> <p>I can’t let that happen.</p> <p>I need to escape him before he can lay a claim, flee from what I’ve always wanted, or risk getting a wolf that will submit to him. But nothing goes to plan. When I’m forced to take on my wolf spirit, my alpha attacks, and the fight shatters us in ways we never knew possible. Now we’re broken. Jagged. Rabid. To punish me, punish us for not submitting, my new wolf and I are thrown away to a savage pack, where we come face to face with Ruin Falls and the biggest monster of them all. Alpha Tyran. But...maybe a monster is exactly what a rabid bitch like me needs. Will my wolf and I snap, lost to our fractured savagery? Or will this ferocious alpha teach us just what our broken nature is capable of? Maybe we can get our revenge....</p> <p>That is, if we’re rabid enough to take it.</p> <p>Authors note: This book is a dark shifter romance. There are elements of strong language, violence, assault, and other situations that may be triggering.</p>";
