window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Juniper</b></p> <p>After a cult tried to sacrifice me to their wicked God, I went on the run, doing whatever was necessary to survive. Until a demon offered me a deal: give him my soul and he'll help me claim the vengeance I seek. Blood will be spilled, and the monsters I once ran from will soon be running from me. But damning my soul was just the beginning; it's my heart the demon wants next.</p> <p><b>Zane</b></p> <p>I've been hunting souls for centuries, but she's the ultimate prize. Vicious and feral, she has a broken soul as dark as my own. I thought claiming her would be a simple game, but Juniper is far from simple. I chose to follow her on a path drenched with the blood of her enemies, but it's our blood that may be spilled next. As an ancient God wakes from Its slumber, neither of us may survive.</p> <p><i>Her Soul for Revenge</i> is book two in the Souls Trilogy but can be listened to as a standalone. It contains sexual scenes including kink/fetish content, horror elements, drug use, scenes of trauma, anxiety, and PTSD.</p>";
