window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In our world, power is king, and I'm the ultimate bartering chip.</p> <p>I'm the daughter of the Don, but my life as a mafia princess is far from a fairy-tale. Trapped in a pretty cage, my family clipped my wings so that I can fill the role all princesses are tasked: to marry a prince and secure an alliance. My mob boss father would give anything to gain an edge over the rest of the Supernatural Syndicates in New York—including me.</p> <p>So my dad makes a deal. The terms are simple. Win the election to become the new leader of Earth and Emerald. Win me.</p> <p>Except . . . I'm not a very good princess and I have no intention of playing nice.</p> <p>These men want to compete for me? Fine—but no one said I couldn't compete for myself. The trials may be deadly, but I've got an ace up my sleeve they won't see coming.</p> <p>There's just one tiny problem. Out of nowhere, the very mating call I'd hoped to never experience consumes me, and I go into heat—at the worst time ever. Talk about a sticky situation.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
