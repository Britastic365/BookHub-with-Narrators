window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Stars die in one of two ways: so slowly that each layer burning out feels like agony or suddenly exploding into a million pieces before the universe even has a grasp of what is happening.</b></p> <p>When Paxton Shaw left Demi Rosen without so much as a goodbye, he stole her shine in both manners.</p> <p>Now, eight years later, he’s trying to pull her back into his orbit. The nation’s most beloved football player, a tight end with a seriously tight end, has finally realized Demi is the one who got away.</p> <p>But she’s a different woman than the weak girl who used to come running whenever he called in the middle of the night. She is strong and successful. Her life’s mission is to grant the wishes of children whose flames have all but been extinguished. And she's untouchable, as dark and cold as a midnight sky with no moon in sight.</p> <p>When one special child forces their star-crossed paths to collide, it’s impossible for Paxton and Demi to keep the feelings of their past buried. Paxton had been her Halley’s Comet: the once-in-a-lifetime love that scorched Demi’s heart in the most spectacular fashion.</p> <p>She promised herself she would never make that mistake again. But how can she forget the dreams of love she once had when Paxton wants to make them come true?</p>";
