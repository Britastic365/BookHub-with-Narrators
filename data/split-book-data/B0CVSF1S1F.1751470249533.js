window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A Grumpy/Sunshine Brother's Best Friend Romantic Comedy</b></p> <p><b>Hugo Jones: Brother's best friend. Mega billionaire. Grumpiest boss ever.</b></p> <p>I brandish equations like lightning bolts and shatter fortunes with mere scribbles on a whiteboard. People up and down Wall Street steer clear of me—or come to regret it.</p> <p>My walls are impenetrable as Alcatraz, and my self-control? Rock solid, my friend.</p> <p>Except when it comes to her.</p> <p>The woman I've secretly longed for. The only woman I can never have.</p> <p>My best friend’s little sister, Stella.</p> <p>Growing up, she saw me as a heartless robot. It couldn't be further from the truth, but a promise I made to her brother binds me, and my code of honor is as rigid as my isosceles triangle.</p> <p>I hadn't laid eyes on her for years, but now she's in the heart of Manhattan, and I've unintentionally sent her career into a nosedive. My solution? Offer her a job at my hedge fund.</p> <p>Suddenly I’m the boss of her, faced daily with her sparkling eyes and gummy worm obsession–and her infuriating refusal to stay away from me.</p> <p>Well, I buried my feelings for her once before. I’ll do it again—to the nth degree.</p>";
