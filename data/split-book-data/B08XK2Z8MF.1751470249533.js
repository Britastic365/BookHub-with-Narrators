window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the author of <i>44 Chapters About 4 Men</i> (inspiration for the Netflix Original series, <i>Sex/Life</i>) comes an immersive dystopian romance unlike anything you’ve ever heard.</p> <p><i>“None of this matters, and we’re all going to die.”</i><br> <br> With only three days left until the predicted apocalypse, the small town of Franklin Springs, Georgia, has become a wasteland of abandoned cars, abandoned homes, abandoned businesses, and abandoned people. People like Rainbow Williams.<br> <br> Rain isn’t afraid of dying. In fact, she’s looking forward to it. If she can just outrun her pain until April 23, she’ll never have to feel it at all.</p> <p><i>\"Supplies. Shelter. Self-defense.\"</i><br> <br> Wes Parker has survived every horrible thing this life has thrown at him with nothing more than his resourcefulness and disarming good looks. Why should the end of the world be any different? All he needs are some basic supplies, shelter, and a sucker willing to help him out, which is exactly what he finds when he returns to his hometown of Franklin Springs.<br> <br> As society crumbles, dangers mount, and secrets refuse to stay buried, two lost souls are thrust together in a twist of fate—one who will do anything to survive and one who can’t wait to die.<br> <br> Perhaps, together, they can learn how to <i>live.</i><br> <br> Before their time runs out.</p>";
