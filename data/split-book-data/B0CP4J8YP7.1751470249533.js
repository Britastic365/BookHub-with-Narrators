window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The grave is one wrong step away.</p> <p>Having narrowly averted an (under)world war, Cat Crawfield wants nothing more than a little downtime with her vampire husband, Bones. Unfortunately, her gift from New Orleans’ voodoo queen just keeps on giving—leading to a personal favor that sends them into battle once again, this time against a villainous spirit.</p> <p>Centuries ago, Heinrich Kramer was a witch hunter. Now, every All Hallows Eve, he takes physical form to torture innocent women before burning them alive. This year, however, a determined Cat and Bones must risk all to send him back to the other side of eternity—forever. But how do you kill a killer who’s already long dead?</p> <p>Performed by Yasmin Tuazon, Danny Gavigan, Belsheber Rusape, Michael Glenn, Christopher Graybill, Jon Vertullo, Stewart Crank, Gail Shalan, Alexander Amado, Alex Hill-Knight, Karen Novack, Holly Adams, Shawn K.
