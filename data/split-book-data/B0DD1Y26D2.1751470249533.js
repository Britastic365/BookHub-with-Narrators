Anything but.</p> <p>However, she's the one woman I shouldn't pursue.</p> <p>She intrigues me, and not just because of her refusal to speak. It's the quiet rebellion she exhibits in every nuanced movement and pointed look. Like a siren, her behavior calls to me but leaves me unsure whether to protect, punish, or pleasure her.</p> <p>Others may consider my attraction inappropriate. It also goes against my strict rule not to mix business with my personal affairs. Being twice her age is another reason to leave her alone.</p> <p>Yet fate has other plans to tempt and test me. And she has plans as well to disobey and defy me. Her opposition makes me want her all the more. But giving into my desires has consequences. Some that are detrimental to us both...</p> <p><i>For mature listeners.</i></p>";
