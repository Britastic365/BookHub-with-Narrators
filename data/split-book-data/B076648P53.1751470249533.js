window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the wrong side of the tracks and with most of her family in jail or dead, Piper Walsh is used to everyone in town thinking the worst about her. It doesn't seem to matter that she's worked hard to build a good life for herself. So she isn't surprised that when she comes into contact with Sweet Hill's wildly irresistible, arrogant sheriff, Hale Walters, they're instant adversaries. Piper has nothing in common with the town golden-boy-turned-lawman - and she refuses to be a notch on his bedpost. </p> <p>Despite rumors, Hale avoids fooling around with the women of Sweet Hill, many of whom are hoping to get him to the altar. But staying out of Piper's path is proving near impossible. The infuriating troublemaker clearly has no respect for his badge. As she continues to push his buttons, it becomes clear to Hale that he must either arrest Piper - or claim her as his own. </p>";
