Maybe you want him to.</b></p> <p><b>Jeffrey</b></p> <p>Returning to my hometown, to normalcy, after all I've been through feels strange, to say the least. Returning to the friends and family who have all moved on with their lives while I'm still trapped with demons of my past haunting me is the worst kind of torment.</p> <p>I'm safe now. Lydia, the woman who stole me when I was just nine years old, is in prison. I'm free. But I don't feel free. I don't even know who I am anymore. The child I was is dead, and the man I've become is lost.</p> <p><b>Mutt</b></p> <p>I found him. He smells like soap and oranges… and sorrow and sadness, but he smells like mine all the same. From the first moment I saw him in the parking lot on the side of the highway, with his pretty speckled nose and pouty frown, I knew that fate had gifted me my mate. In the same breath, mixed with the sweet smell of his delectable skin, I also knew that fate had a cruel sense of humor. Because my mate is not a wolf, but a human, and a human cannot save me from the moon mother's curse. I may not know much about most things or what the future holds for us, but I know I would trek miles and scale mountains to put a smile on my grumpy human mate's face.</p> <p>Hunt Me! <i>is a standalone paranormal MM romance with high heat, an HEA, and no cliffhangers.
