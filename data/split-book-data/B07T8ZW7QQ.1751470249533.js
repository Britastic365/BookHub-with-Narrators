So her mates will live. </p> <p>But Cass can't just abandon them, can she? She's just found them - a home she'd never imagined she could have. So when Death offers her a way out if she plays one of his sick games, she can't refuse. If she plays it right, she might just rise from ash and ember. </p> <p>And her loyal warrior-mates will be with her in life, or death. Even when she has to become the Darkness that devours the worlds. Even when she's lost to herself. </p> <p>She's not lost to them. </p> <p>So, she'll play the final deadly game, and when Cass unleashes her true, powerful self, the immortal gods will burn in her flames. </p> <p><i>*This is the final book in the popular War of the Gods series.
