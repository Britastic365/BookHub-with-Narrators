And I mean everything. </p> <p>I had no idea what I was getting myself into when I took this job. I thought it would be simple - pretend to be Mr. Dane Clark's personal assistant, find the missing blueprints, and get out of the Clark Castle for good. But, somehow this socially awkward, tech-genius billionaire has wormed his way into my heart. And even if we survive this mess, I'm not sure I want to leave. </p> <p><b>Dane Clark: </b>How do I put this? She's...pink. </p> <p>So very pink. Bright and sunny and peppy. I mean, she has at least 104 pairs of sunglasses. Why? I've never seen a woman wear so many sunglasses before: red, pink, blue, green, glitter-encrusted. I don't understand it. </p> <p>As for her organizational skills? Abysmal. Her attention to detail? Non-existent. Her ability to frustrate me to no end? Spot on. I never should have hired her. Lola Pink does not fit into my schedule. Nevertheless, she whirled into my life anyway; and she changed everything. Now I'm stuck trying to keep my company afloat and the two of us alive, while Lola turns my life all shades of pink.</p>";
