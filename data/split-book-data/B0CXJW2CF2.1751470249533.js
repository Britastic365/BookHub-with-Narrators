window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Lucifer meets Practical Magic in this opposites attract witchy rom-com brimming with sass, spice, and small-town charm!</b></p> <p>What’s a broke tea witch to do when she’s about to lose her beloved café?</p> <p>No idea, but chugging magic mojitos and drunk-summoning the Devil was definitely the wrong call.</p> <p>Now, I’m stuck with the house guest from Hell—literally—and we couldn’t be more opposite: a homebody who brews healing teas and reads romance novels to her cats versus a sexy-as-sin playboy with a pitchfork tattoo on his butt and a fondness for public day-drinking. In the nude. Ergo, the pitchfork discovery.</p> <p>Infuriating!</p> <p>I’ve tried to send the Dark Prince packing, but the spell won’t let him leave—not until he unlocks my so-called “heart’s desire.”</p> <p>Well. My <i>only</i> desire is to clear my debt and save the café, which would be a lot easier if I wasn’t so distracted by his stupidly charming British accent.</p> <p>Or the smile that keeps incinerating perfectly innocent panties.</p> <p>Or the spellbinding, toe-curling, never-should’ve-happened kiss at the Wayward Bay Halloween Ball that has me believing in a different kind of magic:</p> <p>Love.</p> <p>So maybe the real question is… What’s a broke tea witch to do when she’s about to lose her café <i>and</i> her heart?</p> <p><i>The Devil Made Me Brew It is the first book in The Witches of Wayward Bay, a series of standalone paranormal rom-coms where the magic is real and the witches always get their magically-ever-afters. No cliffhangers, guaranteed HEAs, and plenty of heat, humor, and heart!</i></p> <p><i>This audiobook features duet narration and is perfect for fans of opposites attract romance, forced proximity romance, stuck together romance, fish out of water romance, and he falls first!</i></p>";
