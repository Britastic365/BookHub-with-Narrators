window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Come one, come all! The Carniepunk Midway promises you every thrill and chill a traveling carnival can provide. But fear not! Urban fantasy's biggest stars are here to guide you through this strange and dangerous world.... </p> <p>Rachel Caine's vampires aren't child's play, as a naive teen discovers when her heart leads her far, far astray in \"The Cold Girl.\" With \"Parlor Tricks\" Jennifer Estep pits Gin Blanco, the Elemental Assassin, against the Wheel of Death and some dangerously creepy clowns. Seanan McGuire narrates a poignant, ethereal tale of a mysterious carnival that returns to a dangerous town after 20 years in \"Daughter of the Midway, the Mermaid, and the Open, Lonely Sea.\" Kevin Hearne's Iron Druid and his wisecracking Irish wolfhound discover in \"The Demon Barker of Wheat Street\" that the impossibly wholesome sounding Kansas Wheat Festival is actually not a healthy place to hang out. With an eerie, unpredictable twist, Rob Thurman reveals the fate of a psychopath stalking two young carnies in \"Painted Love.\" </p>";
