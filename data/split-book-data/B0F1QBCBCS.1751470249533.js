window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Auri Fareview, practical and realistic, does what she can to serve her impoverished family. When she finds a golden key that could be the answer she needs to save her sisters from the unjust Marriage Laws of her land, she discovers the treasure might be more than she bargained for. Enchanted, the key is home to an imprisoned god, who wreaks havoc on her body, her heart, and her soul. And those aren’t practical matters. He has the power to break her.</p> <p></p> <p>Nixus Uraiahs has lost track of how long he’s been imprisoned by the spell on the key. There have been six key-keepers, all of whom have failed to break the spell to free him. He will hold this 7th key-keeper accountable to the bargain of the spell: three wishes and a price for each. There’s no hope in her freeing him, however. Nix knows she'll be like all the key-keepers who came before her. Except Auri approaches her wishes differently than any of the others, and Nix begins to see her as more than just a key-keeper. She intrigues him, proving her strength, surprising him, and enchanting him. Nix realizes his heart is at risk of being captured by the seventh key-keeper, and that is a risk he can’t afford to take knowing his villainy is just a single wish away.</p>";
