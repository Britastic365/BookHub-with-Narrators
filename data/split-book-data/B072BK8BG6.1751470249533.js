window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When Kian confesses his true nature, Syssi is not as much shocked by the revelation as she is wounded by what she perceives as his callous plans for her. If she doesn't turn, he'd be forced to erase her memories and let her go. His family's safety demands secrecy - no one in the mortal world is allowed to know that immortals exist. Resigned to the cruel reality, Syssi is determined to enjoy what little time she has with Kian, one day at a time. </p> <p>Kian and Syssi's story culminates in <i>Dark Stranger Immortal</i>, and the characters embark on a new adventure in book four: <i>Dark Enemy Taken</i>. </p>";
