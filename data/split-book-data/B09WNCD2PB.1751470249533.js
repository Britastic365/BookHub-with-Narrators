window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>CONNIE</b></p> <p>I have a purple stalker. </p> <p>I don’t know what possessed me to hit the Xarc’n warrior with my bat, but now I have a stalker—a big, purple stalker with fangs and horns. And to make things worse, I can’t go back to New Franklin.</p> <p>After my first night out on my own, I wake up all wrapped up and cuddly with a certain possessive hunter. He purrs like a giant cat and vows to protect me. And to top it all off, he has a pet squirrel. A freakin’ pet squirrel!</p> <p>The “Jerk” claims he can’t let go of me, but I don’t buy it. I’m no squirrel, and I don’t intend to be his pet. Not even when he claims I belong with him and promises to protect me forever.</p> <p><b>JORG’K</b></p> <p>Killing the scourge is my calling, and I revel in every violent encounter. Hunters are created with strong instincts to protect, but mine never fully manifested. I just wanted to fight. I never understood why some hunters wanted anything more. Until now.</p> <p>I can’t get the little human out of my head. She attacks me with her wooden club, and I realize she’s all I ever wanted.</p> <p>My brave female watches me as I fight the deadly scourge, so I give her a show of my strength and skills. I will convince her to be my mate. I have to. The mating bond has chosen, and it is never wrong!</p>";
