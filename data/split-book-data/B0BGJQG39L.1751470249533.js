window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>I thought I was living the dream—until the fateful day I found my boyfriend in bed with my boss.</b></p> <p>As a professional copywriter, it was the tired cliche that hurt me the most. What’s a big city girl to do but pack my bags and go solo on that Grecian cruise I’d booked with my ex? Who needs a man when you have tropical breezes, stunning vistas, and free cocktails with frilly umbrellas?</p> <p>But thanks to a freak storm, I find myself washed ashore on a mysterious Greek Isle inhabited by 12 hotties determined to help me in any way they can.</p> <p>What in the rom-com setup is this?</p> <p>Somehow, I’ve ended up inside a famous Greek myth, tasked with conquering the very men I find myself unable to resist—despite their fur, fangs, tentacles, extra appendages, and extremely large…secrets of their own.</p> <p>Danger lurks around every crumbling ancient ruin, but the longer I stay, the more I wonder if I want to return to my old life at all.</p> <p>Here, I get to be the heroine of my own story, and it might just be time to rewrite history.</p> <p><i>The 12 Hunks of Herculeia</i> is a medium-dark rom-com loosely based on the 12 Labors of Heracles, with many ridiculous liberties taken. The series contains MM relationships arcs, swearing, very spicy extracurricular activities, an overly possessive, slightly unhinged group of men, and depictions of violence. Listener discretion is advised.</p>";
