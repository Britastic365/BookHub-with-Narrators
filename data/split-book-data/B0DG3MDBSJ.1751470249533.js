window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Everything in this world has a price tag. Even my innocence.</b></p> <p>That's what my father thought when he sold my V-card to the highest bidder. So much for that romantic first time with Prince Charming.</p> <p>But I give in. A million dollars and a chance to escape the country, far away from my toxic family.</p> <p>I thought I knew what to expect. Some old rich guy who thinks he can have anything he wants. But nothing could have prepared me for Kirill Vyronov.</p> <p>Because Kirill Vyronov is not some old rich guy. Sure, he may be twice my age and so rich he could pave his driveway with solid gold bricks. Sure, he's the most gorgeous man I ever laid eyes on. But he's also the most bloodthirsty Bratva boss on the planet.</p> <p>So, I freak out and make a run for it. But Kirill didn't pay millions just to let me go. Oh no. He paid so that he can bend me over his knees, claiming every drop of my innocence over, and over again. He paid so that he can savor every inch of me, making me his forever.</p> <p>And as much as I hate to admit it, the thought of it makes me tingleâ€¦ down there. As much as I fight it, it is a battle of wills I can't win.</p> <p>And before I can escape this madness that infected my mind, a plus sign on a pregnancy test seals my fate.</p> <p><i>Welcome to Vyronov Bratva!</i> Ruby Mayhem <i>is a Russian dark mafia romance and the first book in the Vyronov Bratva duo. For the best experience, listen in order.</i></p>";
