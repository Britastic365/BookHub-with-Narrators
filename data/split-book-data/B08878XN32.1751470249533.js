Not even a witch.</p> <p>My crazy witch of a grandma placed a spell on my locket.</p> <p>A love spell.</p> <p>I don’t think so. Which means I’ll have to find my cursed necklace and nullify the magic. But first, I apparently have to go on a cruise with Grandma.</p> <p>She’s booked a berth on some fancy boat with others like us. You know, the special folk - as in horns, magic, and a bit of fur. No sooner do I park my broom and find my sea-legs when the locket turns up on board -thankfully, not in the possession of the annoying shapeshifter.</p> <p>Oz is hot, but he’s not my type. Neither is the pirate whom the locket tries to hook me up with. Or the sea monster who gets it next and tries to drown me.</p> <p>Busy avoiding potential suitors, I find myself hoping the locket will end up in the one place it doesn’t belong: In the grasp of the lion who makes me purr.</p>";
