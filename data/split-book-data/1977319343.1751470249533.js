Penned in familiar handwriting, dated over 15 years ago, the letter was written to Molly after her first date with the man she'll never forget. </p> <p>Week after week, new letters appear. Each marks an event in the history of their epic love affair. Each heals a wound. Each holds the confession of the man who still owns Molly's heart. </p> <p>The letters are full of promise, hope, and love, but truth be told, Molly wishes she could unread them all. </p> <p>Because the man who wrote these letters is not the one sending them.</p>";
