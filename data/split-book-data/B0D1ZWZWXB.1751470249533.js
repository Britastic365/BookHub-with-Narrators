window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>For Evie St. Claire, life in Honeysuckle Springs isn't anything like she'd imagined. Sure, the old house is charming, and the smalltown lakeside community is picture perfect. But her kitty roommate Birdie is unpredictable, snarky, and demanding.</p> <p>When a ransom note shows up at Evie's backdoor, she must come clean about her aunt's stolen ashes. She'll also need to decide if she's willing to meet the ransom demands and give up her aunt's spell book, or if she'll search for the culprit herself.</p> <p>Before she can get a grip on that, Evie discovers a secret Birdie's been hiding in the dusty upstairs attic, and things take a turn for the worse. She believes Birdie should handle the mess herself, but if police learn Birdie's secret, they could both be in big trouble.</p> <p>Join Evie and Birdie as they encounter cryptic ghosts, sneak around in mysterious woods, and secretly sleuth in a misty graveyard searching for answers.</p>";
