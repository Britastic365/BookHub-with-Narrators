I knew she was in love with me, and I couldn’t resist her. River Adams gave me her innocence on her 18th birthday. I broke her in return and made her hate me. I thought walking away from her would be easy, but I never expected to come face-to-face with everything I gave up. Thanks to a stipulation in my dad’s will, she’s back and we have to live together.</p> <p>Me.</p> <p>Her.</p> <p>My brother Walker, who has carried a torch for her since they were kids.</p> <p>And, how could I forget, Bishop, the ranch hand who can’t keep his eyes off her?</p> <p>The years between us may not matter anymore, but the secrets and lies always will. My family has blood on its hands; no one more so than me. If she finds out the truth about Twisted Cross Ranch, she’ll never forgive me.
