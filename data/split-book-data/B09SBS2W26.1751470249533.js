window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>You might think the problem would be waking up in Vegas, hungover, next to a beautiful woman who’s wearing your boxer briefs, and finding out you married her, in the middle of an epic, drunken night of festivities.</p> <p>But you’d be wrong.</p> <p>I, Nolan Cassidy, international charmer, and maker of mischief have fallen head over heels for Cora Delaney. I <i>want</i> to be married to the lass.</p> <p>So, you might think the problem would be that <i>she</i> wants an annulment. But, again, you’d be wrong - stop getting it so wrong.</p> <p>I, Nolan Cassidy, with my devil tongue and Irish accent, will no doubt change her mind. </p> <p>So, does the problem lie in that she has a son who doesn't like me, and is as clever and crafty as I?</p> <p>Or that I’ve only got one month until St. Patrick’s Day, to prove to my one true love that I can be a good husband, and father?</p> <p>C’mere, and I’ll tell you....None of that is the problem.</p> <p>I’m a problem.</p> <p>My boxing days may be behind me, but the fight never left me. When I see something I want, I get it. And nothing is going to stand in my way. Not my new wife’s hesitation, nor her son’s doubts.</p> <p>So buckle up, strap in. Because I’m no longer in the business of wanting.<br> I’m in the business of having - which is going to make for one wild Paddy’s Day.</p>";
