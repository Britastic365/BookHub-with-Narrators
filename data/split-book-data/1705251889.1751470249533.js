window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>One hundred years ago, a sheriff's posse killed dark warlock Rhyfel Gremory, but his witch-disciples escaped, and their magic made them nearly immortal. To keep their power, each year one of the witch-disciples kills a descendant of one of the men in the posse, a 12-year cycle that has cost dozens of lives, including that of Seth Tanner's brother, Jesse.</p> <p>Seth rescued Evan Malone from one of the witches, and they've fallen in love despite the danger and chaos, going on the road to complete the quest and bring an end to the ritual murders. Their relationship is new, their emotions are raw, and the danger is real. It's a challenge to find their way as a couple while they're on the road together in the close quarters of Seth's RV, training in magic and combat skills to fight off a supernatural killer.</p> <p>Their quest to stop a century-long killing spree takes them to a small town in the Blue Ridge Mountains. They're ahead of the sacrifice cycle, with plans to stop the murders and kill the dark witch. Only this time, the hunters become the hunted when the witch knows they're coming to get him, and has deadly plans of his own.</p> <p><b>Contains mature themes.</b></p>";
