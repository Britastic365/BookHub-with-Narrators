I was born with black wings, earning me a permanent jail sentence from day one.</p> <p>A noir angel for life.</p> <p>That's fine.</p> <p>I'll own this prison just like I did back home.</p> <p>Even if it's ruled by two hot kings.</p> <p>This reformatory isn't all-girls; it's co-ed. Which means I'm outnumbered ten-to-one by brutes with more brawn than brain. Not a problem. I thrive on aggression, and this place is riddled with it. A nightmare wrapped up in an ebony cloak.</p> <p>Well, bring it on, boys.</p> <p>Just try and claim me.</p> <p><b>Note: </b>This MMF romance novel is part of the Paranormal Prison collection and the start of a brand-new MMF series by <i>USA Today</i> best-selling author Lexi C.
