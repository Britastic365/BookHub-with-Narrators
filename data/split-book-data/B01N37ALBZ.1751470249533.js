window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the second book in number-one <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Ilona Andrews' Kate Daniels series, tempers - and temperatures - are rising! </p> <p>A mercenary in magic-torn Atlanta who cleans up after magic gone wrong, Kate Daniels has seen it all - and some things she couldn't even have imagined. Normally, waves of paranormal energy ebb and flow like an ocean current. But once every seven years, a paranormal flare comes and brings magic like a tidal wave. Now Kate faces problems on a much bigger scale: a divine one. </p> <p>When Kate sets out to retrieve a set of stolen maps for the Pack, Atlanta's paramilitary organization of shapeshifters, she quickly realizes the stakes. During a flare, gods and goddesses can manifest and battle for power. The stolen maps are only the first contest in an epic tug-of-war between two gods hoping for rebirth. And if Kate can't stop their cataclysmic showdown, the city may not survive. </p>";
