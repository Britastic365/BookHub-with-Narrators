window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Shadowvale isn’t your typical small-town America. The sun never shines, the gates decide who enters, magic abounds, and every resident bears some kind of curse.</b><br> <br> Lexi Gardner is a rare creature with a nearly unlimited supply of magic. Unfortunately, that magic has gotten a little low. That’s all right. She’s come to Shadowvale for a refill and thanks to an impending magical event, getting all the magic she requires shouldn’t be a problem. <br> <br> Until she crosses paths with someone who greatly needs her help. A man trapped in the forest. A man no one wanted anything to do with. A man considered by most to be a curse. Lexi, however, sees beyond his past. She sees him for who he is now. And who he could become. The only problem is saving this handsome mountain of a man will take more magic than she has. In fact, it’ll take all the magic she can get her hands on. Seems a small price to pay for his company, however.<br> <br> She vows to help him if he’ll help her in return, something he’s glad to do. But he has his own issues to deal with. As do most people in town. Like Amelia Marchand, the witch who created Shadowvale. Will Lexi be able to help Amelia and her new friend while securing the magic she desperately wants? Because a life without magic won’t be any kind of life at all. Unless love turns out to be all the magic she needs…</p>";
