window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Since I walked away from my rich and royal family and became a house flipper of haunted and magical homes, life was nice and simple. Until I met Byron, the sexy ghost of an incubus...with some intriguing secrets. Now I'm in possession of one of the most dangerous magical artifacts in the world...although I'm still figuring out exactly what it does. What I do know is that I don't want this in the hands of the corrupt magical council.</p> <p>It's not just me tangled up in this. There is also Graham, another sexy incubus who had no idea of his true origins, and the Sullivan twins, two scruffy and charming werewolf contractors. We're planning to buy Greenwood Manor and find the next artifact before the wizard council does.</p> <p>But talk about a wrench in the works. We get to Louisiana just to find a rival witch buying the old Southern mansion right out from under us! I have a bit of a history with Billie Pruitt, but it seems like she might need us as much as we need this house, so my crew and I will have to find a way to work with her and keep our enemies at bay....</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
