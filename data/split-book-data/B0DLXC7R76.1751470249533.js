window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Welcome to Nocturne Falls, the town where Halloween is celebrated 365 days a year. The tourists think it's all a show: the vampires, the werewolves, the witches, the occasional gargoyle flying through the sky. But the supernaturals populating the town know better.<br> <br> Living in Nocturne Falls means being yourself. Fangs, fur, and all.</i><br> <br> Witch Holly Winters is ready for a peaceful, magical Christmas in her family’s cozy mountain cabin in Nocturne Falls. She plans to do some knitting and watch all the best holiday movies. But when ancient dark magic begins to stir in the snowy forest, peace and serenity quickly disappear. With danger lurking at every turn, Holly teams up with Demetrius Voss, a brooding and irresistibly handsome vampire neighbor, to unravel the mystery menacing their beloved supernatural town.<br> <br> As they work together to contain the rising threat, Holly finds herself unexpectedly drawn to Demetrius’s quiet strength and unexpected charm. Between Christmas lights, snowball fights, and quiet moments by the fire, sparks begin to fly—proving that even in the midst of chaos, the holiday spirit has a way of bringing people together.<br> <br> With two quirky cats, a dash of romance, and an epic battle against ancient forces, Holly and Demetrius must rely on each other to protect the town they love. Will they restore the magic in time for Christmas—and discover that the greatest gift of all is the one they never saw coming?</p>";
