The demon club? The humans dying downstairs? The fact that you're a f--king vampire? Where should I begin?</p> <p>He sighed, his forehead falling to hers. \"Astasiya, we have very little time to sort this before the Conclave. I need you to work with me. Both our lives depend on it. What are you wearing?\"</p> <p>She cleared her throat, her hold on his neck tightening as if needing his support to respond. And maybe she did. This was all a lot to take in. \"A, uh, thong,\" she managed to say. \"And a strapless bra.\" Both black and lacy, but she didn't add that part.</p> <p>One of his hands drifted from her hair to her waist, then down to her ass. His palm flattened and forced her to arch up into him. A breath hitched in her throat at the feel of his growing arousal.</p> <p>He's turned on...here...now?</p> <p>She trembled, the heat of his body seeping into her cool skin, warming her blood.

She looked good in it.</p> <p>He ignored her, his mouth brushing hers in a chaste kiss as his hips pressed firmly into hers.</p> <p>Definitely aroused.</p> <p>\"You're going to see things tonight that will make you want to scream, but you must remain calm and quiet. Mortals who overreact die, and they die badly.\"</p> <p><b>Award-winning and best-selling series. Listen to the first three books now!</b></p>";
