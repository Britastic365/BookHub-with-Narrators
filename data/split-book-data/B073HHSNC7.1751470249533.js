window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Sassy Marissa Hamilton heads to her hometown on her way to drowning her recent romantic troubles in her sister's good company and great cooking, but she hadn't counted on how badly her little sports car was going to handle the winding, snow covered Maine roads. </p> <p>Luckily, a very tall, very dark, and very handsome stranger helps her out of the snowbank she's managed to lodge herself in, although he can't seem to do it without lecturing her about safety and emergency preparedness. </p> <p>If it weren't for the sight of his tight ass in worn jeans, Marissa might have gotten cranky, but instead, she finds herself getting interested. </p> <p>Despite her sister warning her off town Sheriff William \"Dodge\" Perkins, Marissa accepts his offer of a date that soon becomes so much more. </p> <p>For his part, Dodge more than welcomes the challenge of taming Miss Hamilton to his hand - as well as other parts of his person - and sets about doing just that in record time. </p> <p>Publisher's Note: A sexy romance with adult discipline. Please, if this offends you, do not purchase this audiobook. </p>";
