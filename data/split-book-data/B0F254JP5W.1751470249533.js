window.bookSummaryJSON = "<i><b>'This book was incredible- my fingernails are bitten to the quick!' : Amazon reviewer Oct 2022</b></i><br>When murder victim Sally Ferguson turns up very much not dead two years after her husband had been convicted of her killing, Police Scotland launches a shameless cover-up exercise to obfuscate the facts behind the monumental foul-up. Tasked with getting to the truth is dissolute cold-case specialist DI Frank Stewart of the Metropolitan Police. Meanwhile forty-something private investigator Maggie Bainbridge and her handsome sidekick Jimmy Stewart are commissioned to investigate the disappearance some seven years earlier of publishing magnate Gerald Morton, supposedly drowned off the rugged Northumberland coast in a sailing accident. The only complication is, Morton's daughter believes he's still alive. When it emerges that a couple fitting the same description had been observed at the scene of both murders, it seems that the crimes may be connected, despite being separated by two years and four hundred miles of geography and with no obvious link between the victims.<br>And then as Maggie, Jimmy and Frank struggle to untangle the unfathomable mystery, the killer strikes again. Now someone very close to the threesome is in deadly danger.";
