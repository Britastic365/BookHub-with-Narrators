window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In Washington, where everything is at stake, no one’s hands are clean, and nothing is ever as it seems. </p> <p>Jaclyn Taylor’s life is curated to absolute perfection. Despite having secret political ambitions of her own, the only way the Washington darling will have a seat at the table is on the arm of a Senator, Vice President, or if she plays her cards right, as the wife of the next President of the United States. Engaged to presidential hopeful Christopher Blake, everything is falling into place for Jaclyn. Until he doesn’t show up on their wedding day. </p> <p>Forced to either postpone or cancel the wedding, his twin brother offers to take Christopher’s place for the day, helping her save face and maintain her loveless arrangement. Temporary. A charade. Smoke and mirrors. Except for Alexander Blake, nothing about standing in for his missing brother is pretend. Even through the lies and deceit, he finds himself falling for the one woman he shouldn’t. But when Christopher reappears, ready to claim his place as Jaclyn’s husband, Jaclyn and Alexander face the difficult choice between love and politics.</p>";
