window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Be careful of deals made with gods in the dark…</b></p> <p>Bargaining with the gods is never a good idea, but desperate times call for desperate measures. With the fate of all the realms in the balance, Paesha Vox has moved beyond desperate. In an attempt to save a little girl that needs her, she strikes a deal with a god and steps into a dark new world where using magic gets you killed and not blending in draws unwanted attention. With a countdown hanging over her head, she doesn’t have time to waste, but she quickly learns that allies are everything in this strange world.</p> <p>When she’s forced into a pretend marriage to avoid the dungeons, her new husband promises to help her, but trust isn’t something she gives easily. She can’t tell him about her past, and he refuses to tell her any of his. But his connections and knowledge are exactly what she needs to find the Lord of the Salt, the one promised to have the path that will take her home.</p> <p>Except finding him is only the first of her tasks. Around every corner lurks another god trying to draw her into more deals and new dangers that could end her life before she has a chance to fix everything. Friendships are forged, but more enemies are made.</p> <p><b>The gods are circling, the past is calling, and sometimes, going back to the beginning of the story is exactly what’s needed.<br> <br> This is a standalone story in the Never Sky series. You can read it on its own, or you can start at the beginning with Till Death. If you choose to read out of order, there may be minor spoilers.</b></p>";
