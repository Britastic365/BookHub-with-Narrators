Jennifer and A-Rod. Marilyn and Joe. When a professional athlete and a megawatt star fall in love, the world is obsessed . . .</p> <p>With four chart-topping albums, Lacey Logan is a superstar whose life no longer feels like her own.

To maintain her privacy, Lacey skillfully controls her narrative, showing fans and paparazzi what she wants them to see.</p> <p>But when Lacey discovers her boyfriend is hiding two devastating secrets—a bad cocaine habit and a pregnant girlfriend—she begins to lose confidence and control of her own story. Then big-shouldered baseball player Jimmy Hodges, a former Rookie of the Year when Lacey was in high school, walks into the bar where she’s venting to a friend. With his shaggy beard and unfashionable button-down, Jimmy is the opposite of the picture-perfect guy Lacey thinks she wants. Soon, sparks fly and inhibitions go out the window when Lacey dares to take some chances.</p> <p>Lacey and Jimmy are polar opposites. But could this be the forever after they both need?</p>";
