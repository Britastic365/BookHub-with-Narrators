window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In Mega-City One, the Judges are the law - acting as judge, jury, and executioner. But how do the citizens really feel about a system where they are powerless? </p> <p>America Jara and Bennett Beeny grow up as best friends, living a fairly trouble-free life in a dangerous city...bar the odd, negative encounter with a Judge. Time draws them apart, and when they are brought back together, Beeny is a successful singer and America has become involved with a terrorist organisation known as Total War, which has the Justice Department in its sights! </p> <p>This dark and complex tale is considered to be one of the best stories to ever come out of the Judge Dredd universe.</p> <p>Featuring Joseph Fiennes as Dredd, and an ensemble cast including Paterson Joseph, and Matthew Jacobs Morgan, fans of Judge Dredd and newcomers to Mega City One alike will be transported to brutal dystopian world Dredd for an immersive listening experience like no other.</p>";
