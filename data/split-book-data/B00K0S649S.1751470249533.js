As Kurt continues to enlighten her on the darker facets of her sexuality, the student unexpectedly becomes the teacher.And suddenly Kurt is confronted with the irrefutable proof that love is so much more than a societal construction.</p> <p>Warning: This book is only suitable for readers who are turned on by hot doctors engaging in sexual experiments, bondage, m√©nage a trois, exhibitionism, suspension, anal sex and other deviant behavior using mechanical stimulation devices they've invented to make your wildest dreams come true.</p>";
