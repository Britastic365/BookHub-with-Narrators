I can’t stop thinking about her muffin. Or how guilty I feel when I fantasize about buttering it.<br> <br> Claire has always been as much a part of Beacon Harbor as the hanging flower baskets, the boat tours, and the lobster races. She has no idea how beautiful I think she is. Even when she has flour on her face. Even when she’s rolling her eyes at me.<br> <br> I’ve got her brother’s approval, but now it’s Claire that I really have to convince.<br> She doesn’t believe we have the right ingredients for a real relationship—so she only agrees to <i>pretend</i> to be my girlfriend to help me close a deal in New York.<br> I believe she’s about to discover exactly how I roll when I know what I want.<br> And what I want is her.</p>";
