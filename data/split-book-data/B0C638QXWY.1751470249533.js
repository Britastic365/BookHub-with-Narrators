window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Bound together by a brand…</p> <p>Kept apart by the unyielding rules of the Pack.</p> <p>My foster brother, Nick and I are destined to be Fated Mates</p> <p>But when his Beast comes out on the night my NEED is on me</p> <p>Will we commit an unforgivable sin together?</p> <p>Being an orphan is tough…going through the foster care system is even tougher. I never would have made it through without my foster brother, Nick Callahan, to guide and protect me. But Nick and I have a troubled past. See, he’s full-blooded Were and I’m half Were and back before our fathers died, they swore an oath to be blood brothers and had both Nick and I branded to prove that we were family.</p> <p>Nick and I went our separate ways after we got out of the system, but I made the mistake of going back to my hometown of Wolverton on the night of the Open Breeding. And who should be there but Nick—my foster brother and protector and the one and only man I’ve ever really loved. But we’re forbidden to be together—the same brands that mark us as “family” keep us forever apart.</p> <p>And there’s another problem—Nick has a secret, one he’s been keeping from me for years. You see, he’s not a normal Were—he doesn’t shift into a wolf. Instead, he has a beast inside, half man/half wolf—an eight foot tall monster that hungers for me just as much as Nick does. Now I must choose between my foster brother and breaking the Unbreakable Laws of the pack. But under the full moon when his beast comes out and the Breeding Fever makes me crazy with need and desire, will I really have a choice?</p> <p>You’ll have to listen to The Brand that Binds, book two in the Forbidden Omegaverse series to find out…</p> <p>Author’s Warning: STOP! If I am an auto-buy author for you, please read this before you buy. This book needs all the trigger warnings. It has the death of parents, (although that happens off-screen, so to speak) childhood trauma within the foster system, and some near-misses with assault. If you have a history of any of these things, you might find this book upsetting. You should also be warned that this is a Shifter book and some things happen in Fur Form that you might find disturbing. Again, if this kind of thing upsets or offends you then please, DON’T BUY THIS BOOK! I want all my fans to be happy and feel like their money is well-spent when they buy my books. So please buy and listen responsibly and don’t say I didn’t warn you—this one gets DARK.</p> <p>Hugs and Happy Reading!</p> <p>Evangeline</p>";
