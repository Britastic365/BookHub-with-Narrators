window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I don't use the term \"bully\" lightly. However, I have no qualms about using it when it comes to Max Cooper. </p> <p>Arrogant. </p> <p>Aggravating. </p> <p>Annoying. </p> <p>Those are just a few of the names I have for him that start with the letter A. I haven't gotten through the rest of the alphabet...yet. From the moment I met Max three years ago, he was nothing but an asshole. The only reason we put up with each other is because we share the same best friend. </p> <p>Then, everything suddenly changes when Max is involved in a horrific accident that sets him back three years. He remembers his friends, but here's the real kicker: He doesn't remember...me. At first, I think it must be a cruel joke, but then I see how serious he is. </p> <p>Over time, I get to know the real Max Cooper. The one who can be sweet, funny, and kind. The one who shows me he's not such an asshole after all. </p> <p>Then, the inevitable happens. I fall for him. Just as things between us begin to balance out, I lose my own equilibrium, and I don't know why. But, despite all of this, no one is prepared for the real terror that's about to unfold.</p>";
