It isn't honest either, but it means I get to eat.</p> <p>Until one night, a sinfully sexy angel strides into my favorite dance hall and compels me to work for him. It isn't just work, though. He wants me to be his wife in Castle Hades. Apparently, his prophetic dreams say I'll help him become king.</p> <p>Beautiful as he is, he's also a lethal tyrant. And I could be in danger. Luckily, I know how to fight back, how to weaken an angel: I must seduce him.</p> <p>Now, this is a battle, and heâ€™s my beautiful enemy. We are fighting with weapons of desire, and we're both at risk of losing ourselves in this war.</p>";
