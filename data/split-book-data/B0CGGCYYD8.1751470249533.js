window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Enter a world of gargoyle protectors, rising demons, and one girl with an explosive secret.</p> <p>Eighteen-year-old Trinity may be going blind, but she can see and communicate with ghosts and spirits. Her gift is the reason she’s been in hiding for years in a compound guarded by Wardens—shape-shifters who protect humankind from demons. If the demons discover the truth about Trinity, they’ll devour her to enhance their powers.<br> When Wardens from another clan arrive with reports that something is killing both demons and Wardens, Trinity’s world implodes. Not the least because one of the outsiders is the most annoying and fascinating person she’s ever met. Zayne has secrets of his own—but working together becomes imperative once demons breach the compound and Trinity’s secret comes to light. To save her family and maybe the world, she’ll have to trust Zayne. But all bets are off as a supernatural war is unleashed…</p> <p>Adapted from the novel and produced with a full cast of actors, immersive sound effects and cinematic music!</p> <p>Performed by Tanja Milojevic, Robb Moreira, Kevin Couto, Danny Gavigan, Christopher Walker, Aure Nash, James Lewis, Khaya Fraites, Stephon Walker, Drew Kopas, James J.
