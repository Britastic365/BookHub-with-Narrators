I’m sworn to protect my kind from any kind of threat.</p> <p>As a human, she thought I was there on friendly business. Didn’t know I meant to take down her shifter boss. I didn’t know she’d flip my world upside down.</p> <p>One whiff of her scent, and I was lost. No–<i>found</i>. I couldn’t leave without her. So, I spent the night. Made her fall for me.</p> <p>But she doesn’t know what I am. What I’ve done. I’m not just a ranch hand–I’m a shifter enforcer. The clock is ticking before I have to finish the job.</p> <p>I must win my mate’s heart and claim her before the lies catch up to me. Before she finds out what I am and what I have done. Or what I will do to keep her safe. And <b><i>mine</i></b>.</p>";
