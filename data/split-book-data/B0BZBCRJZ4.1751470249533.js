It’ll be fun, they said.</p> <p>Yeah, well, they’re dirty rotten liars.</p> <p>When I told Tennessee we needed to have more schools than just Edenburg, I thought they’d assign appropriate people to the task. Ya know, like actual adults. Not a 16-year-old who still has to finish high school herself.</p> <p>But then, Tennessee became Coven Leader, and my great idea came back to bite me in the ass. Sure, the Majors and Minors of Manhattan were technically in charge and they’d brought in fantastic witches to teach. However, our fearless, nonhuman Leader wanted Deacon and I to oversee everything.</p> <p>I wanted to be honored that he trusted us that much, but I barely knew how to use my own magic. How was I supposed to run an entire magical academy without destroying the city or getting anyone killed?</p> <p>I didn’t know, but I was about to find out.</p>";
