window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>I’ve been abandoned by every man in my life—except for one.</i></b></p> <p>He arrived at the outskirts of Riviana Star just in time, and not only saved me, but the people I’ve come to consider my own. He pledged to be at my side always—and made me make the same promise in return. My heart can’t hold onto the anger and resentment a moment longer—not when I want this man for the rest of my life.</p> <p>Queen Eldinar and the elves are far more suspicious of him than they ever were of me, but they offer him what he wants—the location of the dragons—if he does something for them in return. A war is coming in their forest—an attack by the dark elves that want to evade the Realm of Caelum—and they want the Death King to defeat them.</p> <p>The relationship between us has changed, an invisible rope tied in many knots binding us together. I’ve pledged my life to help him with his cause, to avenge the family that was so ruthlessly taken from him, not just because I want to free the dragons, but because I want him to have peace. He’s given that to me—and I want to give him the same.</p> <p>A secret locked in the depth of my heart, I know my feelings for Talon are far beyond the physical. I can feel his soul next to mine when we’re together. When I picture life after the war, I’m not Queen of Scorpion Valley or the Northern Kingdoms—but Queen Rothschild of the Southern Isles.</p> <p>But there’s something between us that Talon refuses to share. Something I can’t see—but something I can feel every time we touch. A distance that only flourishes rather than withers. A secret so heavy it sinks us in the middle of the sea.</p>";
