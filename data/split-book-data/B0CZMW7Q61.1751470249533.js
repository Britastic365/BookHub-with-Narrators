window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Everything changed the night Kri almost died.</p> <p>Simply being her coworker or her friend is no longer enough.</p> <p>I need more. I want forever.</p> <p>When she woke up from that coma, her eyes sought mine.</p> <p>My hand was the first one she held.</p> <p>And for eight weeks, I stayed in the hospital with her.</p> <p>No matter how many times she tried to push me away, I never faltered.</p> <p>Two years ago, we shared a passionate moment, but she quickly retreated from our connection.</p> <p>I've craved her ever since.</p> <p>Kri's clearly been hurt before, so I've been patient.</p> <p>But I can't stop fantasizing about how it'll feel to drive her wild with pleasure.</p> <p>I'm done waiting.</p> <p>My plan to win her heart starts falling into place when she agrees to live with me while she recovers.</p> <p>But she's determined to keep it platonic.</p> <p>Until the night she gives in and slams her mouth to mine.</p> <p>With her back to the wall, I give her a glimpse of how it feels to surrender to her desire. And to me.</p> <p>Then she pushes me away. Again.</p> <p>Now I'm longing for the inevitable moment when she lets me claim her - body, mind, heart, and soul.</p> <p>But danger knocks at our door.</p> <p>And we've got a houseguest - an unruly teenager needing our protection.</p> <p>No matter the threat, I'll do what I do best.</p> <p>Protect those I love.</p> <p>And make no mistake, I'll get the girl.</p> <p>Whether she likes it or not.</p> <p>Author's Note: Comeback Hero is Book 3 in the Redleg Security Series (spicy bodyguard romantic suspense with romcom vibes). The series is best heard in order to avoid suspense-related plot spoilers. Each book starts right where the prior book ends. If you do not wish to listen to them all, then this story can listened to as a stand-alone.</p>";
