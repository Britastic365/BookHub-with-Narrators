window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Raised by a family of cops who see the world in black and white, I grew up with a defiant streak a mile long, and an immunity to gun-toting alpha males.</b></p> <p>That is until I find myself at the Carnage clubhouse, and at the mercy of their Kings. Now, my black-and-white world is a dirty shade of gray, and my immunity to alpha males has disappeared...along with my underwear.</p> <p>While I find myself torn between my knights in blue and my kings in black leather, a killer emerges from the shadows, ready to rip both my worlds apart. He thinks he knows who I am; he thinks I’m weak, but he couldn’t be more wrong.</p> <p>My name is Reign. I was born to rule, and I’ll do anything to protect the people I love. Even if it means sacrificing myself.</p> <p><b>This book is intended for listeners over the age of 18 due to swearing, violence, and sexy fun times, with not just one biker, but three.</b></p>";
