window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Humans aren't as alone as they choose to believe. Every human possesses a trait of supernatural that lays dormant within their genetic make-up. Centuries of diluting and breeding have allowed humans to think they are alone and untouched by magic. But what happens when something changes? </p> <p>He's spent the last few years in hell fighting in the demon games and doing things that would haunt even the fiercest of men's nightmares. But now Hunter Brooks is back in the human realm, ready to take on the pack that left him behind...and take the mate he's just met. </p> <p>Becca Quinn is one of the seven lightning-struck women - a human who isn't so human and only needs to find her true half to unlock all that she could be. Hunter, the dangerous, sexy wolf, has saved her life twice, and yet she knows nothing about him - only that she wants to know everything she can. </p> <p>Between the pack's council and strangers who could take everything away from them, Becca and Hunter have more to fight and everything to fight for. Hunter's dark past takes over their courtship, and just when he thinks all his lost, he'll find that Becca's more than he - or she - ever thought. </p> <p>Warning: Contains a sexy wolf who broods with the best of them, a woman who defines the term unlucky, and a chemistry that's sure to make the wolf howl in all of us. </p>";
