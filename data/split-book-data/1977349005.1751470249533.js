window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>As with everything else in my life, the descent into Hell was not so simple. </p> <p>When I jumped into the portal, I expected to find the Sins on the other side. I expected to find my people - demons - waiting and ready. What I found were flames and fire and ash. </p> <p>The apocalypse hadn't waited for me. It had already begun. Hell's barriers were collapsing in on themselves - making my task of finding the Sins infinitely harder. As the Horsemen and I set out on our journey to find them, we discover that not all is what it seems. </p> <p>A white-haired assassin once told me to beware of the evil that hides in plain sight. I should have listened to her. </p> <p>The fight for Hell has begun, and the duty of saving it lies solely on my shoulders, but to win - to survive - I must unravel the secrets of the past if any of us are to see the future. </p> <p>I will take what is mine, even if I have to bleed for it. </p> <p><b><i>Contains mature themes.</i></b></p>";
