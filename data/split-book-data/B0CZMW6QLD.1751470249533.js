If I’m to save the Enchanted Vale and the High Princes, this rose is going to need to grow thorns.</p> <p>Being a part of the fae is wonderful. Except that the enchanted castle I live in is falling apart, one of my mates wants to give up his magic for good, the other one seems to be hiding something from me, and the two cursed fae princes I’m in love with still need to find their actual mates. Oh, and the villainous Prince of Thorns keeps trying to kiss me. And I kind of want him to.</p> <p>When whispers of war spread from the Spring Realm, we find ourselves on a knife’s edge, trying to prevent a betrayal that could tear the realms—and my princes—apart. A vicious enemy from the Below will stop at nothing to kill me and claim Spring for herself. And Ezryn’s own brother has turned against him, claiming the Spring throne for himself. Allies become enemies, and enemies become allies.</p> <p>Now, more than ever, I’ll need to light a way for my princes and help Ezryn, the High Prince of Spring, take back his throne. I won’t let him lose himself to the darkness… unless I lose myself first.</p>";
