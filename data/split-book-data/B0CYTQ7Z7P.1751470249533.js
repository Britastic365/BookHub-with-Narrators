When my phone rings after a night drinking with my best friend, I had no idea my whole world was about to change.</p> <p>\"A book is missing,\" a deep, unnaturally enticing voice growls down the line.</p> <p>Panicked, I race out to Dragerfield Library, breaking all the rules—even if a book is missing, we’re only allowed on property during the day. But if I don’t find that ancient tome, I’ll be fired anyway.</p> <p>\"You should have waited until morning, human.\"</p> <p>Too late to retreat, I soon learn why the rules exist. </p> <p>Dragerfield is a doorway between worlds. A doorway to Risest, the Faerie realm. A realm they access at night. And I'm the moronic human who wandered uninvited into their midst. </p> <p>The fae use humans for two reasons: entertainment, and well, you can use your imagination for the other. Even worse, the voice on the line that set all of this in motion is no ordinary fae. Drager, with his dragon scales and smoky scent, is one of their gods. A Fallen Five. My new captor. </p> <p>A missing book is the least of my worries now. I'd thought I was about to be fired, but instead, I'm heading to Faerie. And it might be a one way trip.</p> <p>*This is a continuation of the short story in the Beasts and Beauties anthology.
