window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>When all that you want, is all that's forbidden...</b></p> <p>I've known him my entire life. Before marriage. Before fatherhood. Before betrayal. Now, he's one of rock's bad boys trying to be good. Trying to be the best father he can for his daughter. He's my brother's best friend. He's my boss. He has a wife. Max isn't mine to have, but I want him all the same. And I haven't survived all that I have to not go after what I want.</p> <p><b>Her story is a tragedy, mine's a publicity disaster.</b></p> <p>Just when I needed her most, she walked back into my life, and the timing couldn't be worse. With a newborn baby, a divorce, an album to record, and a world tour to plan, I don't need the distraction. She's off limits. She's my best friend's little sister. She's my nanny. Billie's a golden drop of sexy sun on a grey autumn day, tempting me into the light and a life full of possibilities. A life not meant for us.</p> <p><b>Contains mature themes.</b></p>";
