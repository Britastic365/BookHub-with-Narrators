window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Your Irresistible Love</b></p> <p>My new client is trouble. From the moment I step into his office, he makes it clear that he wants me. I am the marketing consultant for his jewelry empire. Daydreaming about the hot CEO is definitely not on my to-do list. Neither is doing said CEO.</p> <p>But he breaks down all my defenses, until I'm ready to break all the rules for him, and I discover that it's all more fun if it's forbidden. But what happens when we get caught?</p> <p><b>Your Captivating Love</b></p> <p>I'm finally pursuing my dream: opening my own clothing shop. After working so hard to get here, I need to concentrate on my new business, and can't afford distractions. Not even if they come in the form of Logan Bennett. I didn't know that bossy, determined men were my thing until he kisses me, making me want to risk everything for him.</p> <p><b>Your Forever Love</b></p> <p>I know I should stay away from Eric Callahan. If my messy divorce is any indication, I'd be better off forgetting that men exist. But Eric is impossible to ignore. He has a body made for sin and a sense of humor that matches mine. And seeing how adorable is with his daughter melts my walls (and panties). But how can I let him in, especially when he's leaving town so soon?</p>";
