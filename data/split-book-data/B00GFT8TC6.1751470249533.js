window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Can Sloan truly love again after losing her young husband? </p><p>At twenty-nine, the widowed Sloan Tallett thought her best chance at love was gone. It takes every ounce of her strength and concentration to balance her work as a dance teacher at the local college with her responsibilities as a single parent to her three young children. If she was lucky, Friday nights would be free for the occasional date. The dates never added up to much, but her bills did. When Wesley Adams, a handsome, retired all-American quarterback comes to town on business, Sloan is slow to acknowledge his obvious attention to her. When she realizes that this wealthy catch is attracted to her, though, Sloan glimpses what could be a very comfortable life. </p><p>Desperate to make a better life for her children and herself, Sloan decides to seduce him. She's convinced he'll never discover her love is just an act! But she soon finds herself falling for him and his natural charm. Is it possible for Sloan to truly love again?</p>";
