window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When the shoe drops, it always hits her on the head....<br> <br> Tessa Albertini has spent much of her life guest-starring in other people's stories. Her older sister is a type-A personality who creates opportunities like other people build hopes, and her younger sister finds trouble like it's an integral strand of her DNA. Finally, Tessa's hard work and sacrifice allow her to open that restaurant she's been dreaming about since she was a young teenager working her butt off, regardless of the obstacles now slamming into her.<br> <br> There's an advancing enemy who doesn't want Tessa to succeed in business, while Nonna Albertini is determined she'll succeed in love, no matter how much meddling it takes. Finally, Nick Basanelli, the most arrogant and sexy man she has ever met, zeroes his formidable focus into actually courting her—and that's before he discovers she’s in danger, morphing into overprotective alpha male mode. <br> <br> While a family's middle child is supposedly a peacemaker, the world is about to discover that when pushed far enough, Tessa is willing to go to war.</p>";
