window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>He's cursed with eternal silence....</b></p> <p>Roderick MacLauchlan is death for hire. Blessed by an ancient deity with Berserker rage, he has the strength of ten men. Cursed by a malicious enemy, he's incapable of speech. A desperate clan war rages around him and a malevolent adversary lurks in the darkness, calling for blood.</p> <p>Evelyn Woodhouse is an English refugee with a dangerous secret. She has the ability to see the outcome of tomorrow's battle and knows they're on the wrong side of it.</p> <p>When a doomed and silent mercenary rescues her from a fate worse than death, it seems he has his own plans for her. This is his last night alive, and she's never been able to defy destiny.</p> <p>Join Clan MacLauchlan Berserkers as they each find a love that will be worth defying the forces of evil and risking their souls to save our world.</p> <p>Whether sheâ€™s writing about Celtic Druids, Victorian bad boys, or brash Irish FBI Agents, Kerrigan Byrne uses her borderline-obsessive passion for history, her extensive Celtic ancestry, and her love of Shakespeare in every book.</p>";
