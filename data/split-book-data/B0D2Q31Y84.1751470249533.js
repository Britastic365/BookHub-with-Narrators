So we punished them, forced them into our dark, dangerous, and decadent realm. In the land of Faerie, we made these rebellious women play three deadly games.</p> <p>We didn't expect them to defy us. We didn't expect them to win, much less to consume us with a forbidden desire, to seduce our black, sinful hearts.</p> <p>Now they're our fated mates, our equals, our everything. With the slightest touch, these women stoke a passionate fire that burns eternally.</p> <p>Indeed, we've become even more vicious than before because now we have something to protect. Something more valuable than power, magic, and dominance.</p> <p>A fatal battle looms between humans and Fae. And we'll do whatever it takes to keep our mates safe. Even if it means tearing apart our worldâ€”and risking our immortal souls.</p> <p>Defy the Fae <i>is the fourth and final book in Natalia Jaster's sexy fantasy romance series, Dark Fables: Vicious Faeries, where the villain gets the girl.

Armentrout, Holly Black, Laura Thalassa, and Raven Kennedy. Intended for mature listeners.</i></p>";
