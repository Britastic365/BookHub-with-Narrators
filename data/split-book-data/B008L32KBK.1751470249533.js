window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The brightest, sexiest romance yet from the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of <i>Grand Passion</i> and <i>Trust Me.</i> </p> <p>Unconventional Molly Abberwick, trustee of her late father's scientific foundation, is mad enough to fire her new consultant, Dr. Harry Trevelyan. A brilliant expert on new inventions, the handsome Harry irritates Molly to no end with his preposterous insistence that they have an affair - and that it could be planned, predicted, and run like a science project. But just when Molly is ready to let him have a piece of her mind - not her heart - she discovers that the eminent Dr. Trevelyan is not what he seems. </p> <p>First, there is his family, a long line of carnival folk who run the Smoke &amp; Mirrors Amusement Company. Then there are the paranormal premonitions which bring Harry to Molly's side when she most needs him. And when her troubles escalate into violence and a mysterious stalker threatens her life, Molly turns to Harry's sixth sense for help, and discovers she needs Harry not just for a week, or for an hour, but forever in love. </p> <p>With this sparkling new love story, Krentz works her magic once more for an <i>Absolutely, Positively</i> wonderful new romance!</p>";
