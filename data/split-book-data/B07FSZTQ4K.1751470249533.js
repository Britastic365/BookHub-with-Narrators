To begin with, he hated her, but as the months bled into years, he learned the opposite of hate, dedicating his life to giving her everything. Every sacrifice, every gift, he gave wholeheartedly. But then love turned to lust and ruined everything. </p> <p>Della</p> <p>I was stupid to write down my secrets, but I'd been stupid before, so it was nothing new. I couldn't blame him, hate him, fix him. I tried to move on without him. But no matter what I did, I couldn't seem to delete the secrets I'd written. Until something happened. Until he came back and read my stupid secrets. And nothing was the same after that.</p>";
