window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>One night. No strings. And a really good puck.</p> <p>Five years ago, Astrid O’Malley experienced the ultimate in public humiliation.</p> <p>Being dumped at the altar by her childhood sweetheart was horrifying enough.</p> <p>That fact that he was a professional hockey goalie and her dad was his coach? It was all anyone in sports could talk about.</p> <p>Eff hockey. Eff goalies.</p> <p>These days, Astrid lives a life (mostly) free of hockey and free to pursue whoever she wants with exactly zero shame in her game. Like tonight’s hook-up. This guy’s nailed the lumberjack aesthetic perfectly. Especially when he has the stamina and creativity to back it up.</p> <p>Because the rule is: it’s one night only. Which is gonna be a problem because she’s just discovered he lives in the apartment upstairs.</p> <p>And he’s joined her dad’s team. As the goalie coach. To train her ex.</p> <p>Now Astrid is in some kind of hockey hell—filled with her ex, her family, and the best sex of her life. And somehow she’s been roped back onto the team. Puck my life.</p>";
