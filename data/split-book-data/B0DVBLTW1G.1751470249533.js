Until I meet her.</p> <p>One look and I know she's mine, the only woman I'll ever want, and the only one I'll ever have. My little <i>kisa </i>belongs to me, and I won't let anything come between us… not even my own family.</p> <p><b>Lara</b></p> <p>I've been taught since birth to hate the Melnikovs. They're the monsters who are responsible for my father's death, or at least that's what my mom says, but Luka Melnikov isn't the monster I'm expecting. He's a man who's dedicated his life to his family's Bratva, a man who's never allowed women to get close to him, but he takes one look at me and decides I'm his.</p> <p>He wants me to be his first, his last, his everything. And he'll end anyone who tries to stand between us.</p> <p><i>This is a very steamy dark mafia romance. It has an untouched MMC who is possessive and protective to the extreme. This is the second book in the Devils Will Rise: Melnikov Legacy series. The books are interconnected, but each can easily be enjoyed as a standalone. No cheating, no OW drama, and an HEA is always guaranteed! For mature listeners.</i></p>";
