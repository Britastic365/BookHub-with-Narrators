Why else would they send her to investigate a hundred-year-old cold case about some illusive “phantom” lurking in the depths of a crumbling old Opera House?</p> <p>It turns out she’s probably right, but as unlikely as it seems, there might be something to it. There’s definitely more in the shadows than a few rats and some pieces of forgotten scenery—especially now that she’s woken it up.</p> <p>The phantom is real. And now he's set his sights on her. As the old legends come to life around her, Christine becomes increasingly snared in the web of a monster who has linked her to a ghost from the past. But is this phantom fiend or friend? Angel of music or demon of the pit?</p> <p>Her lover…or her killer?</p> <p><i>The Forgotten Phantom</i> is a gripping second-chance retelling of the classic Phantom of the Opera tale. It has themes of stalking and murder and may not be appropriate for all listeners.</p> <p>Thrills, chills, horror, and romance!<b> </b>Creature Feature is a series of standalone romances that take the classic movie monsters you know and love and reimagines their stories where the villains get to keep the girl.
