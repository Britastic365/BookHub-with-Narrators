window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When she is released from the stasis she voluntarily entered, the world that greets Emily Harding is far from what she expected. It more closely resembles a post-apocalyptic novel than the rolling green Tennessee hills she’s left behind. </p> <p>Worse than that, it seems that the rule of law is a thing of the past, and that society has devolved into what it was thousands of years ago - feudal tribes warring with each other over precious and rare supplies, which includes females. One type of female in particular. </p> <p>It is raw, unforgiving, and animalistic. Much like the behavior of the man who takes her and holds her there, forcing her to learn that even she is not unaffected by the changes that have been wrought on the world, proving to her time and time again that she is nothing more to him than a means to obtain children. </p> <p>And making her scream in agonizing pleasure as he does so.<br> </p> <p><b>Publisher’s Note: </b><b><i>The Alpha's Woman</i></b><b> is a dark tale with some explicit themes.</b></p>";
