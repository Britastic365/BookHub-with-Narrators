window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>He has only one rule: Never run. Surrender. </p> <p>I owe my life to a masked killer. He came for me, like an avenging angel of death sent to spare me from pain and humiliation yet teach me the price of salvation. </p> <p>I am bound to him by the blood he spilled for me, but he didn’t save me out of mercy. I don’t think he even knows the word. He wants submission. He wants me by his side. And he wants this city for his own. </p> <p>I will never surrender. </p> <p><b><i>Alpha</i></b><b> is the first book in Nora Ash’s suspense-filled Omegaverse series, Alpha Ties. Each book is a full-length novel with a complete romance story line. This series gets dark, and it gets </b><b><i>dirty</i></b><b>. If you don’t enjoy your romance scorching and your alphas rough and dominant, give this book a pass.</b> </p> <p><b>Please note: This book is the compiled version of Nora's previously published Omegaverse serial, </b><b><i>Alpha</i></b><b>. It contains the installments </b><b><i>Alpha: Taken</i></b><b>,</b><b><i> Alpha: Masquerade</i></b><b>, and</b><b><i> Alpha: Mated</i></b><b>.</b></p>";
