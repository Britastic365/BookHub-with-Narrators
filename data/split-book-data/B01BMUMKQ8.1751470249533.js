window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>A Story of Sexual Obsession</i> </p> <p><b><i>Lily:</i></b> </p> <p>I should never have agreed to it. </p> <p>A woman will do a lot to keep her husband happy. But when my husband sells me to the highest bidder - billionaire, former Navy SEAL, pride of Boston's business scene - I agree, not to keep him happy but because it gives me the chance to finally escape. Escape my marriage, escape my debts, escape my life... </p> <p>Josh Lane demands a steep price: my pride and my morals. But the truth is, I've never felt anything like what I feel for him. He brings color into my gray world. And his insistence that I submit to his commands - his depraved, filthy, <i>amazing</i> commands - only feeds my craving to be taken by him. Again. And again. </p> <p>I should never have agreed to it, but I'm so glad I did. </p> <p><b><i>Josh:</i></b> </p> <p>I don't need to pay to keep women in my bed. Though my preferences may be unorthodox, I never leave a woman unsatisfied - far from it. Lily Boswell, though... Her innocence draws me; her secrets intrigue me. Having her is worth dealing with her cowardly scum of a husband. </p> <p>I want to release her passions and heal her wounds. </p> <p>On my terms. </p> <p>Because the blindfolds and restraints hide more than she could imagine. I must keep her safe from the people who would destroy me - and the demons that haunt my dreams. </p>";
