By day, she teaches pole fitness in a rundown studio; by night, she slings drinks at The Iron Spur, a lifestyle club. She hides behind the bar while quietly dreaming of writing the romance novel that might just change her life.</p> <p>But a near-fatal “accident” and a series of frightening incidents prove someone wants Roxie out of the picture, permanently.
