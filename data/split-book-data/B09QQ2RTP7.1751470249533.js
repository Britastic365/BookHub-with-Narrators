window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>All my life, I’ve trained to kill shifters, and now I’m one of them.</b></p> <p>My parents were murdered by wild packs, but the Lux Academy saved me and raised me among other orphans like me. They taught me the shifters’ savagery and how to destroy them. But, everything changes when I’m pulled into a life among the packs, my sworn enemies.</p> <p>They think I’m the alpha for their powerful triad - a group of three wild werewolves with iridescent stares and indomitable hearts, one of which thinks I’m his fated mate. But, I care nothing about triads and their brutal ways, and I definitely don’t care about the possessive shifter that tells me I’m his at every turn.</p> <p>No matter how sexy he is, I will never be his. My only hope is to escape, and neither their guards, spells, nor my twisted fate will get in the way of my escape.</p> <p><b>If you enjoy Leia Stone, Jaymin Eve, Patricia Briggs, Ilona Andrews, Kelly St. Claire, Shannon Mayer, Linsey Hall, or anything paranormal romance, you will love this series.</b></p>";
