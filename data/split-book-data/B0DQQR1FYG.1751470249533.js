window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>A present under the wrong tree…</i></b></p> <p>I stopped believing in Santa Claus and happily-ever-afters when I lost my parents…so ten years ago I stopped trying. I threw myself into running my dad's hotel, <i>The Diamond, w</i>here I make California dreams come true for the rich and famous. But now I realize there’s no one to come home to. I have no family, no friends, just my first ever boyfriend who works more than I do, and in three months barely even knows me.<br> <br> I have every material thing a person could ask for yet I still feel...empty.</p> <p>And then Will asks me to marry him. He wants to bring me home to Megelle Island to meet his family.</p> <p>I tell myself I’ll break it off after the holiday. I tell myself I just want one real Christmas with a family and then I’ll show myself out the door. Three weeks will fly by fast. But then I meet the Bow family. They’re everything every family should be and being around them is helping to heal the cracks in my heart. Giving them up is going to be the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do.</p> <p>Especially Archer.<br> <br> <b>*Part of a mini-series but can be listened to as a standalone, in any order with the others.</b></p>";
