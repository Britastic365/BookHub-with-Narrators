window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Five years ago, I saw something I shouldn’t have.</p> <p>Ominous, right? But what really sucks is I got caught. I’ve been trapped as my animal ever since, hidden away and forced to stay shifted and silent.</p> <p>Until one day, when I get brought to a pet shop where a shifter recognizes me for what I am and brings me to her pack. A really friggen weird pack.</p> <p>I need to get out of here.</p> <p>But then I see<i> him - </i>the male wearing the chain around his neck. Maybe it’s his scent or his shiny stuff that draws me in. Either way, I’m going to bite him so good...just as soon as he stops fighting me off.</p> <p>Surprisingly, this pack is starting to look a lot less weird and a lot more like home. Too bad the shadows of my past are hunting me down for ratting them out. Life isn't easy as a new misfit, but it is worth the fight.</p> <p><b>Author's note</b>: This is book two in the Pack of Misfits series and is not a reverse harem story. Each book will have a different mate dynamic. Every story is a stand-alone, but it is best if you start with Addie's book. Intended for mature audiences 18 years and older.</p>";
