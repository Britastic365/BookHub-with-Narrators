window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>My captor, my enemy, and my fated mate.</i></b></p> <p>I’m the best bounty hunter in the business. I find lost artifacts that people would kill to possess. I’m also broke. When a notorious leprechaun offers me a job I can’t refuse, I realize too late I’m not hunting an object.</p> <p><b>The contract was simple; steal the prince, escape unseen.</b></p> <p>Spoiler alert: I failed. Horribly.</p> <p>The moment I step into the fae kingdom beyond the veil, I feel it—someone watching me. <i>Waiting for me.</i></p> <p>King Vareck.</p> <p>He’s nothing like I imagined—fierce, unyielding, and as cursed as the frozen lands of Faerie. An ice-cold ruler whose very presence bends the room to his will. He shouldn’t care about a thief like me, but we have one thing in common.</p> <p>Vareck is more than just a king—he’s the man who has haunted my dreams for years.</p> <p>And apparently, I’ve been in his too.</p> <p>The difference?</p> <p>He’s been searching the nine realms for me, and I never thought he was real.</p> <p>Now that he’s found me, he has no intention of letting me go.</p> <p>*<b>Beneath the Cursed Veil</b> is sarcastically funny, fantasy romance novel with steam. This is book one in the <i>Faeted Seasons: Winter</i> duet.*</p>";
