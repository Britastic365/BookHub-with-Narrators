Will she find the strength to face her past and embrace her future?<br><br>Look inside to begin reading now!<br><br><i>*A Lady’s Betrayal is the intriguing 21st novel in the Best Laid Plans series of historical romantic suspense and comedy. If you love historical romance with strong female leads, humor, hijinks, and romance, this book is for you. It's recommended for ages 17+ due to infrequent strong language and sexual situations.</i><br><br><b>Interview with the author:</b><br><br><b>Q. What makes the Best Laid Plans series so special?</b><br><br>A. It’s a mixture of things, I think. I began writing this series for my friends, detailing what zany adventures our daughters might have had if they’d been alive during the Regency and Victorian eras, plus I wanted to create something I’d enjoy reading myself. I usually choose humor and intrigue, so you’ll see those aspects sprinkled throughout the series. I’m also a sucker for love triangles, second chances, enemies to lovers, strong female characters, and friendship as a whole, so if you can also show me character growth along with it, then I’m a happy reader. If there was a Historical Romantic Comedy genre, my books would fall into that category for sure!<br><br>As the series progresses through the Victorian period and beyond, the characters change as do the plotlines whether it’s spies, criminals, amnesia, etc. but the strong female characters and hilarious antics continue on in a way that has been extremely entertaining to write.<br><br><b>Q. What order should I read the books in?</b><br><br>A. Great question! There are a few different options, actually. Book 2, A Lady’s Choice, is a prequel and can be read first, second, or even last, although I’d suggest reading it towards the beginning as those main characters pop up in quite a few of the first books peripherally. Book 4, A Lady’s Wedding can be read after book 1, A Lady’s Scheme, or you can wait and read it after book 3, A Lady’s Rake. Although they are all part of the universe and incorporate members from the same three families popping in and out of other character’s stories, each book can be read as a standalone.<br><br>A Lady’s Scheme<br>A Lady’s Choice (prequel)<br>A Lady’s Rake<br>A Lady’s Wedding<br>A Lady’s Spy<br>A Lady’s Refrain<br>A Lady’s Prose<br>A Lady’s Resolve<br>A Lady’s Arrangement<br>A Lady’s Remedy<br>A Lady’s Mischief (prequel)<br>A Lady’s Scream<br>A Lady’s Adventure<br>A Lady’s Ambition<br>A Lady’s Destiny<br>A Lady’s Deception<br>A Lady’s Freedom<br>A Lady’s Dream<br>A Lady’s Escape<br>A Lady’s Preference<br>A Lady’s Betrayal<br><br>The chronological order of the books is as follows if you’d rather read them that way:<br>Book 2 Choice 1799<br>Book 11 Mischief 1812<br>Book 1 Scheme 1818<br>Book 12 Scream 1818<br>Book 4 Wedding 1818<br>Book 5 Spy 1823<br>Book 3 Rake 1837<br>Book 13 Adventure 1837<br>Book 6 Refrain 1842<br>Book 21 Betrayal 1842<br>Book 8 Resolve 1856<br>Book 17 Freedom 1860<br>Book 7 Prose 1863<br>Book 16 Deception 1876<br>Book 9 Arrangement 1882<br>Book 18 Dream 1886<br>Book 14 Ambition 1892<br>Book 15 Destiny 1893<br>Book 10 Remedy 1901<br>Book 19 Escape 1906<br>Book 20 Preference 1911<br>";
