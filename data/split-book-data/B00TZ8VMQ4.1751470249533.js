window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The highly anticipated sequel to <i>Under Different Stars</i>, winner of four 2014 utopYA Awards.</b> </p> <p>Eighteen-year-old Kricket Hollowell was looking for her place in the world when she discovered that the universe was bigger - and more dangerous - than she had ever dreamed. Now, whisked across space to the planet Ethar, Kricket learns that her genetic ability to see the future makes her a sought-after commodity...and the catalyst for war between her star-crossed parents' clans. According to Alameedan prophecy, one house will rise to power, and the other will be completely wiped out, and Kricket's precognition is believed to be the weapon that will tip the scales. </p> <p>A target of both the Rafe and the Alameeda houses, Kricket finds protection - and a home - in the arms of Trey, her Etharian bodyguard-turned-boyfriend. But her visions of what's to come disturb her deeply, especially since she must discover whether the gift of foresight will allow her to rewrite the future or if her fate is as immovable as the stars.</p>";
