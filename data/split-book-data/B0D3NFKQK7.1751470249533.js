Rejected by both her bloodlines, she's turned her back on her people to become a freelance investigator, hiring herself to take care of common problems like hen-stealing goblins.</p> <p>When Ember's best friend asks for her help, it leads them both into a glittering world of conspiracy and danger. Angel's little brother has vanished, and Ember must race against time to save his life. But when Ember discovers what's happened to DJ, both she and Angel find themselves recruited into Herne's elite squad of bounty hunters. Now, Ember must not only face her heritage, but she's bound to preserve the balance between the Fae Courts, for if order isn't maintained, war and chaos will spill out into the mortal realm.</p>";
