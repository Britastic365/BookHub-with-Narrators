Ursa is as beautiful as she is dangerous, and the one person my father warned me never to let close. But she’s all crimson lips and pretty lies, and I’m convinced despite my fear.</p> <p>It’s a simple enough plan, if not for the faint of heart. An auction to sell the one thing I possess of any value — myself. The money will free Alaric and then we can finally be together.</p> <p>Except nothing is simple at all.</p> <p>Ursa is playing at games I can only begin to comprehend. And Alaric? The man I thought I loved might be just as much a villain as the woman I can’t help but be drawn to.</p> <p>When playing in the darkest depths of love and lust, it will be everything I can do not to drown.</p> <p>Content Warning: Emotional/financial parental abuse (father)</p>";
