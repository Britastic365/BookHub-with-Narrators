But when NASA recruits her to join a team of military scientists for an expedition to the Target, it's an adventure she can't refuse. </p> <p>The ship isn't vacant, as they presumed. </p> <p>A disembodied voice rumbles inside Jane's head, \"You are home\". </p> <p>Jane fights the growing doubts of her colleagues as she attempts to decipher what the alien wants from her. As the derelict ship devolves into chaos and the crew gets cut off from their escape route, Jane must decide if she can trust the alien's help to survive.</p>";
