window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Four wildling lovers. Five mates to align. Fourteen missing kids.</p> <p>With five very different personalities bound by the universe, it's no surprise \"aligning our quint\" isn't as easy as I hoped. Still, when all the life and death obstacles hit us, it's musketeer time - all for one and one for all. Do we have the juice to pull it together and unite the realms? Um...no one seems to agree on that. The one thing that everyone is straight on, though, is that the corruption in the upper levels of the Fae Concealment Office must be rooted out and stopped.</p> <p>What do superpowered teenagers have to do with anything? Who is moving behind the scenes to make our lives more difficult? And what's the real reason Brant is holding back? Because I know it isn't what's happening behind closed doors. As a woman who's never made it work with one guy, do I have what it takes to make it work with four? Gawd...I hope so.</p>";
