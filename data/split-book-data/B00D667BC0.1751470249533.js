window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In this next searing tale of the Immortals After Dark series, number-one <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Kresley Cole delves deeper into the mysterious Clan MacRieve, a family tormented by ancient agonies and forbidden wolven hungers.</b> </p> <p>Uilleam MacRieve, a centuries-old Lykae warrior, was captured, caged, and experimented on by a shadowy human order, along with other immortals. During a prison break that devolved into one of the bloodiest massacres in recent history, he escapes. But the aftermath of his unspeakable torture preys on his damaged mind, while the wolf inside him roars for vengeance and carnage. In the days leading up to the full moon, can MacRieve rein in his beast, even when he encounters his mate - a vexingly impossible female unlike anything he'd ever dreamed for himself? </p>";
