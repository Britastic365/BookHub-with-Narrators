window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>What if the big bad wolf kidnapped Little Red Riding Hood solely for his pleasure?</b></p> <p>After my grandmother passed away, it left me with this feeling of emptiness. I had a dead-end job, no friends or family, and I was trying to navigate this new world while being utterly alone.</p> <p>The perfect solution? Take a once in a lifetime trip to Alaska and reconnect with the wilderness and all the things that make me happy.</p> <p>Being isolated in a cabin with no electricity, running water, or cell service sounded perfect until I roughed it in the wild and realized this might not have been the best idea.</p> <p>Things were going great until they weren’t, and I realized I wasn’t alone. It was the hunter, and I was its prey.</p> <p>And when I finally came face to face with my stalker, it wasn’t anything I could have pictured in my wildest dreams.</p> <p>He was a monster, a literal furry, huge werewolf-looking beast that said he chose me as his mate, and I was now his.</p> <p>He took me to his lair where he touched me, licked me…gave me pleasure. And despite knowing I had to fight him and this new reality, I wanted more.</p> <p>Wolf might be terrifying to look at, bigger and stronger than anything I could ever imagine, but his sole purpose was to please me.</p> <p>The real question was, did I ever want to go back to civilization and the life I once knew?</p> <p><b>A Little Red Riding Hood reimagining.</b></p>";
