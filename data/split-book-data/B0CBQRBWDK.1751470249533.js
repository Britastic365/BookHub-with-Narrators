window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Who doesn’t love a bad guy?</b><br> <br> My family is certain I’ll settle with a boring, law-abiding pack before I graduate from Omega University, but I have other plans. Dangerous ones that break laws, but what’s life without a little risk? With a little practice, my sticky fingers turn to skilled pickpocketing and I discover who I’m truly meant to be: a thief.<br> <br> When a bank robbery that was meant to help me find financial freedom goes haywire, I’m taken hostage by a rough group of men. They have no idea who they’ve taken, but they’re about to find out. No one kidnaps Jo Walsh and gets away with it.<br> <br> I hate them for taking my money, but respect them for their cunning plans. While I plot their demise, part of me wonders if this isn’t the pack I’ve been destined for all along.<br> <br> They’re not good, but then again, neither am I.<br> <br> Can I find a home in a nest of thieves?<br> <br> <i>This is a why choose omega-verse standalone novel. If you like slightly unhinged male main characters who will do anything for the woman they love, this is the book for you. </i></p>";
