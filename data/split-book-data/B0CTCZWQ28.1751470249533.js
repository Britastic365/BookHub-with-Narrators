Or two: time is a wheel.</p> <p>For now, his family is safe, but there is one big issue...</p> <p>Lochie asked, “How many vessels are there?”</p> <p>Magnus said, “There are about twenty-six, by last count.”</p> <p>“How many do you have in your possession?”</p> <p>“We have about six, here, there are more in the kingdom. We hae lost track.”</p> <p>Lochie said, “I think the losin’ track might be an issue.”<br> <br> Magnus knows he needs all of the vessels, he doesn't want to loop, and that they don't want anything, or any <i>one</i>, overwritten. This is imperative, history can't be undone.<br> <br> <b>Alone on the timeline they seemed safe, but are they?</b><br> <br> With new enemies and old scores it seems that keeping the timeline straight might be the most difficult battle of all.<br> <br> This is Book 18 of the Kaitlyn and the Highlander series, a love story that encompasses all time. It's a contemporary romance with a dash of history and a bit of SciFi — the series must begin with book 1.</p>";
