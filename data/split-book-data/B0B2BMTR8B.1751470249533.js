window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Tomorrow is yesterday.</b></p> <p>It is 2056. Mathematics professor Elisabeth Gabai is fascinated by multi-dimensional forms that have no equivalent in reality. Then, her boss sends her to the site of an artifact that might have come straight from her theories—or from the technology of an advanced civilization.</p> <p>Twenty-eight years earlier, physicist Max Webber is hell-bent on improving Einstein’s theories of relativity. His latest concept seems flawless, except it predicts the end of humanity. The extinction of Earth can only be prevented if Max can locate a multi-dimensional object. He’s in a hurry; tomorrow will inevitably be too late.</p> <p>But how is he supposed to accomplish this goal when physics tells us the artifact he seeks cannot possibly exist?</p>";
