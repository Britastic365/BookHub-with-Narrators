window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Become enchanted by the fantasy world of gods and mortals in bestselling author Scarlett St. Clair's reimagined New Greece. Listeners are \"hopelessly addicted\" to the story of Hades and Persephone told from Hades's point of view.</p> <p>Hades, God of the Dead, does not take sides or bend the rules. He makes no exceptions to these values—not for god or mortal, even his lover, Persephone, Goddess of Spring.</p> <p>Usually, fear prevents retaliation.</p> <p>But not this time.</p> <p>When Hera, Goddess of Women, approaches Hades with a plan to overthrow Zeus, he declines to offer help. As punishment, Hera sentences Hades to perform a series of labors. Each feat seems more impossible than the last and draws his attention away from Persephone—whose own tragedy has left her questioning whether she can be Queen of the Underworld.</p> <p>Can Hades maintain the balance he craves?</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
