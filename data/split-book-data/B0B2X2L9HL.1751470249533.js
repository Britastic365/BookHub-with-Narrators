window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A trio of bloodthirsty aliens have already destroyed one world and most of their own race; now they have their eyes set on earth. Their opponents: the men and woman of E-Branch and a brand-new Necroscope!</b></p> <p>Malevolent aliens, the Mordri Three decide to become so evil that God himself will have to stop them. They can alter flesh with a simple touch, literally turning people inside out or seeding them with cancer. The Three have already destroyed an entire solar system and most of their own race. Their next targets: mankind and Earth!</p> <p>On Earth, Scott St. John is mourning his beloved wife when he is struck by a golden arrow of light—a fragment of the soul of Harry Keogh, the original Necroscope—and gains powers he does not understand. A mysterious, beautiful woman appears, desperately trying to warn Scott about something...then vanishes mid-word. Scott dreams of a very unusual Wolf, who begs him—in human speech—for rescue.</p> <p>A fledgling Necroscope, a telepathic Wolf, a beautiful woman from beyond the stars, the ghost of Harry Keogh, the best of E-Branch's psychic fighting forces, and a dead girl who is not yet ready to seek her just reward must defeat three impossibly strong, psychically gifted monsters whose touch literally melts flesh from bone.</p>";
