All of them are stuck there waiting for the ten seconds of agony, called the Showing, that will sort them into one of the seven castes. And they’re all praying that they aren’t one of the unlucky few destined to be one of the powerless Unshown. <br> <br> But when Lilith’s Showing happens, the crystal that appears on her body marks her as a degenerate Lust demon. And the icing on the cake? She grows horns. <br> <br> Demons don't grow horns. It's supposed to just be a myth. But Lilith has, and in doing so she's caught the eye of some powerful people who want her dead. Fortunately, she's also got the attention of the Strange God, the demonic deity, and he's decided to appoint seven men to protect her... <br> <br> If she can find them first....<br> <br> <b>This is an 18+ Reverse Harem Novel, Book 1 of 4 in the Vice College for Young Demons series.</b></p>";
