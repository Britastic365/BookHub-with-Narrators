window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Only when the darkness falls can you see the light of the stars. </p> <p>For thousands of years, the scribes and singers of the Irin race have existed to protect humanity and guard the gifts of the Forgiven. They have lived in the shadows. They have kept their secrets. </p> <p>But the Irin aren't the only race with secrets. </p> <p>Ava and Malachi have survived the darkness, but will they ever discover the light? A powerful cabal of the Fallen may hold the answers, but to surrender them, it wants the Irin race to finally face their enemies. Both those coming from the outside and those raging within. </p> <p><i>The Secret</i> is the third book in the contemporary fantasy series, the Irin Chronicles, and the conclusion of Ava and Malachi's journey. </p> <p>Cover design by Damonza. </p>";
