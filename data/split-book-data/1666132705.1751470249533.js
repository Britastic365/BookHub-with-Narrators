window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Perry Palomino has fought her demons - and won - but the battle is far from over. She's now left broken and on her own, leaving behind her life and family in Portland to focus on giving Dex Foray - and the <i>Experiment in Terror </i>show - a second chance. But their past mistakes continue to tease and test their relationship, as does the wild and desolate terrain of the Canadian Rockies. The snow-covered peaks and ravenous forests hide an urban legend too unbelievably frightening to be true, and the only way the duo has a chance of surviving is if Perry can let in the very man who sent her to hell and back.</p> <p><b>Contains mature themes.</b></p>";
