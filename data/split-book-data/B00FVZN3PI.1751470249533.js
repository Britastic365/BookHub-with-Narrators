window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Navigating the world alone is all Josephine Geroux has ever known. Life-altering tragedy struck early on for her. She learned the hard way how to adapt and survive. After such chaos, maintaining a life free of complications is a priority for her. Everything changed when a man with amber eyes came through her door and claimed her heart. She fell hard in more ways than one. The pull between Jo and Damon seemed like fate bringing things full circle. With another devastating loss looming, Jo fights to hold on to the very thing that brought her to her knees. She finds herself torn between a promising future and clinging to a devastating past. But that's not the most worrisome problem on her hands. She must convince more than just herself to let the past stay in the past, where it belongs, but on her journey to find closure and resolution, she does the exact opposite. An old wound caused by a heinous act becomes exposed for what it is. The truth is catastrophic, and Jo is helpless, watching as the ruins of her fragile world endure more turmoil. Jo is left to make a decision: accept the circumstances she finds herself in or fight with unwavering ferocity to restore what has been damaged. </p>";
