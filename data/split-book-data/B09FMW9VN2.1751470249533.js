As they each try and fail to dominate me, the only person who remains on my side is my best friend and former lover, Emory. But as the trip wears on, I begin to suspect even Emory's keeping secrets.</p> <p>Plus, lest I forget, there are still the blood-drinking monsters that dog our steps and leave a few nasty surprises along our journey.
