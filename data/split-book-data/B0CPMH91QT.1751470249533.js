window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Hundreds of years before Red</b></p> <p>Civilization is failing in a steady decline. In a last-ditch effort to save themselves, humanity has turned to trying to understand their world even as they seek to protect themselves from the monsters within it. This is how Evelyn Willock found herself stationed in the farthest northern reaches of the habitable zone and answering the call to investigate a strange sighting in the mines much farther to the north where all other human settlements had failed.</p> <p>It is no small task. Few will go outside the habitable zone. Fewer still will venture beyond the northern border, where the forests grow thick and are filled with innumerable dangers. Stationed where she is, Evie is the best candidate to take on the job. She is familiar with the dangers of the forests.</p> <p>But in the woods, something new lurks. Wolfish monsters, larger than men, brutal, and terrifying.</p> <p>Danger and pleasure meet when the tables are turned, and she becomes the hunted, the feast for their inhuman hunger. Within it all, Evie discovers a meeting of hearts with three males from a dying species who would seek to claim her in every way.</p> <p>Torn between duty and desire, Evie must discover the secrets that haunt the northern lands and decide on the course her future is to take. To stay with the males who have captured her heart would mean leaving all that she knew behind. But beyond that, another worry was coming to light. If the Ragoru were not the cause of the reported sighting, what was? And was it possible that a new, even more insidious danger lurked beneath the mountains?</p> <p><i>Intended for mature listeners.</i></p>";
