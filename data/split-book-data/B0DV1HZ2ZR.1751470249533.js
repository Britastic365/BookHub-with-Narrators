That's the name of the show that I'm planning to pitch to a producer that's based on my life. Will Fox ever give me a ring? Who knows! I don't, and I don't think Fox does either. If the rock currently sitting not on my finger is any indication, we might be doomed.</p> <p>In the meantime, let me introduce to you my new best friend: a cherub. (Are we surprised by this turn of events? No. I flipping love cherubs.) Akile Aristide walks into my life, declares that I'm his bestie, and then flips the world on its three-way axis. What's a Harbinger to do except announce, \"Incoming!\" and hope everyone's buckled in?</p> <p>The Trouble with Trying to Hook a Harbinger <i>is an MM paranormal romcom with a Harbinger who gets to change his title to The Chosen One, a slightly manic Reaper who's out for a little blood, and the family that they're building one adoption at a time.</i></p>";
