They escaped. Most of them.</p> <p>To the underbelly of the kingdom, the Nightrender never made it out of his own scheme. To Malin, he’s only Kase, the man who owns her heart, and who is once again a prisoner of their enemies. Malin and the Kryv will stop at nothing until he’s free... even if it means claiming her birthright to a throne that brings death and war.</p> <p>But when they discover Kase has been locked in a cruel spell, Malin must find a way to steal his new twisted memories before he is lost to them for good.</p> <p>The only trouble is when Kase looks at Malin, all he sees is an enemy with a death sentence.</p> <p>Return to the vicious world of the Eastern Kingdom in <i>Game of Hate and Lies</i>, book five in The Broken Kingdoms series.
