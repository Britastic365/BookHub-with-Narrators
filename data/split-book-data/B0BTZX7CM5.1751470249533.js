window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Welcome to Fate Hollow Academy, a place where supernaturals come together to train for war on humans.</b></p> <p>Humans and dragons alike had declared war in Kalista. Every supernatural must stand and fight, but would it be unified or did the dragon cult hold their allegiance?</p> <p>Humans have been experimenting on their own, creating something more mechanical than human. Dragons have been making alliances with other supernaturals under the guise of fighting our mutual enemy, but their agenda was darker than that.</p> <p>All I wanted was to hide away with my mates, wrapped in the love we shared. It was a fantasy I desperately yearned for, but with every turn, a new enemy revealed themself.</p> <p><i>Fate Hollow Academy Term 2</i> is book two in the Fate Hollow Academy Series. It is a paranormal why-choose romance with all characters over the age of twenty-one.
