window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Love is a curse. </p> <p><b>Three hundred years ago, Warin lost his humanity.</b></p> <p><b>The night he met Thea was the night he lost his soul.</b></p> <p>For more than 200 years, Warin has roamed the wilds with only his blood brother, Aleric, for company, terrorizing villages and feeding on human life. Sating his dark hunger was all he ever cared for...until <i>she</i> crossed his path.</p> <p>From the moment he meets his beautiful Thea, her emerald eyes and tender heart call to him like a siren's song. But she is human, and unless Warin can uncover the truth of their connection, he'll never be able to possess her the way he so desperately desires.</p> <p>Enlisting the help of the Ancients of his kind always comes with a cost. Especially when Thea is revealed for what she really is: either a gift from the gods...or a curse on his bloodline.</p> <p><i>Origin </i>is a prequel novella to the Ancient Blood series. Although I only deal in happily ever after, we haven't reached the end of our tale yet, so make sure you pick up book one - <i>Wicked Soul</i>!</p>";
