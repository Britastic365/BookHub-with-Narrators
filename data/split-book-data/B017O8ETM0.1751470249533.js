window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the magical world of Khanerenth, there's a long way to go before Sasha and her dream prince, Jehan, can get to perfect. Jehan's deception has left her unable to trust him and grimly determined to search for her missing father. Jehan only wants to protect Sasha from the dangerous undercover mission he's undertaken to heal the broken kingdom, but he knows she can't afford to listen to him - not when he's the one living a lie. Enemies, allies - and temptation - make the ballroom floor as dangerous as pirate raids. In a world where love is danger and honor is difficult to define, the crown is not the only thing on the line for a wicked prince and a princess with a core of steel. There's a royal price for love. </p>";
