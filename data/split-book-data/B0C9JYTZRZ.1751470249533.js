window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Raine Tallentyre always tried to heed her late Aunt Vella's advice—and keep her paranormal abilities a secret. But when she journeys to Shelbyville, Washington, to clear out her aunt's house, Raine's highly developed sensitivity leads her to a horrifying discovery: a young woman is held captive in a basement storage locker. And her kidnapper is on the loose.</p> <p>Without warning, a new man enters Raine's life—investigator Zack Jones. While Raine hears voices, Zack sees visions, and suddenly Raine experiences an intense, thrilling intimacy with him that she never dared to expect. There's one complication, however: Zack is working for the secret Arcane Society. Dedicated to the study of paranormal phenomena, the organization lost Raine's trust long ago, when it shattered her family with an act of betrayal.</p> <p>Now, as a killer makes her his target, and a cabal of psychic criminals known as Nightshade operates in the shadows surrounding them, Raine and Zack must rely not just on their powerful abilities but on each other as well.</p>";
