window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The angel of death locked me in one of his castle rooms, surrounded by books and delicious food. Not bad, right? Except for the loneliness, and the lust-fueled dreams that torment me every night - specifically dreams of Samael. And did I mention a psychotic ghost keeps trying to kill me? Because no one else believes me about that. </p> <p>Now, I’m desperate to get out of the castle and hunt down the murderous Free Men who led to my imprisonment. Samael wants to destroy them too. We have the same goal but don't trust each other. When distrust shifts into passion, it only makes things more complicated. </p> <p>Despite what we feel, we’re destined to be enemies. If we can’t rewrite our fates, we’ll lose each other forever - and one of us will end up dead.</p>";
