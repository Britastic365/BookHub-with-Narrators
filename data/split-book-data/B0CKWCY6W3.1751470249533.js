window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>They say monsters are made. I was born one.<br> <br> With an angelic face and a cursed talent, I eat magic and ask for seconds. When I pass through the land, flowers wither, earth scorches, and colors bleed out—all at the command of my father, the God of Ruin.<br> <br> I escaped his prison, only to stumble upon a dangerous school ruled by five heirs. Girls fight to fall into their laps, even though they’re all hot mess assholes.<br> <br> My name is Barbie, but the vampire prince calls me “Little Bob,” mistaking me for a boy. I roll with the punches and pose as a servant boy in the House of Vampires to hide from my father. I try my best to fly under the radar, but the Fates keep tossing me into the path of the cruel princes.<br> <br> That’s how I bump into Killian, the dark, enigmatic, and most powerful heir. I want him, but he’s the forbidden fruit. He’s drawn to me too, like a moth to a flame.<br> <br> When he doesn’t like the burn, he rips off my bodice to betray my secret in front of everyone and forces me to enter the cutthroat game of the Brides Selection.</p>";
