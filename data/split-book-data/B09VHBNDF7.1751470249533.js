window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"Sexy, tough, and deftly sprinkled with dark humor.” (<i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Larissa Ione)</p> <p><b>The line between obsession and love has disappeared.</b></p> <p>The world has changed. Any rules that might’ve been in place before the Scorpius bacterium ripped through civilization and decreased its population are no longer in place. Obsession and survival are the new reality. So, Marcus Knight, after a hellish time in captivity that stole most of his memory and all of his soul, has one focus, and that’s keeping Dr. Penelope Kim safe in the aftermath. She’d risked her life to save him once, and she’s all that matters. For months, he’s kept his distance, protecting her from afar, because he knows that one touch - one sigh - one kiss - from her will never be enough. </p> <p><b>Passion is a dangerous and deadly temptation.</b></p> <p>Penny Kim is one of the few doctors still living, and she alone holds the key to ensuring the human race continues. Several of her friends are pregnant, and the clock is ticking down on their survival. Her days are filled with experiments and hope, while her nights are consumed with visions and dreams of the hard-bodied and powerful soldier who’s made her safety his one and only mission. She should be wary of him; she should be terrified of him. Yet all she feels is an unreal craving for his touch that gets stronger every day. Life is short, and she’s unwilling to wait, unaware of the danger already hunting them both. Some risks are worth it, even in this new and dangerous world. </p> <p>“Thrilling, post-apocalyptic romance at its dark, sizzling best!” (<i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Lara Adrian)</p>";
