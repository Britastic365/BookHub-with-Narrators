window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I thought Peter Pan was a myth and Neverland a fairy tale. A story spun by my mother who had lost her mind a long time ago.</p> <p>But there was no denying the overwhelming shadow cast by Peter Pan when he was standing in my house.</p> <p>Pan took me captive to Neverland, and I somehow found my place among him and the Lost Boys.</p> <p>I’ve never looked back.</p> <p>Now, I’m entangled right alongside him in a war we can’t seem to escape. We thought we had defeated our enemies.</p> <p>We thought we could finally have our happily ever after.</p> <p>But there was one enemy we never saw coming.</p> <p>A fairy who has nothing to lose and everything to gain.</p> <p>The fairy with golden wings and a dark, twisted heart.</p> <p>She wants Neverland, and she’ll destroy anyone who stands in her way—even her own flesh and blood.</p> <p>Note: <i>The Fae Princes</i> is a reimagining of Peter and Wendy.
