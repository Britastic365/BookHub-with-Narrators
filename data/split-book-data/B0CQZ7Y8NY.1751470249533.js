window.bookSummaryJSON = "<b>Boxed set of four #1 bestselling Vampire for Hire mystery novels, starring Samantha Moon―mother, wife, private investigator, vampire! Plus, the <i>Christmas Moon</i> novella!</b><br><br><b>MOON DANCE (Book #1)</b><br><br>Six years ago federal agent Samantha Moon was the perfect wife and mother, your typical soccer mom with the minivan and suburban home. Then the unthinkable happens, an attack that changes her life forever. And forever is a very long time for a vampire. Now the world at large thinks Samantha has developed a rare skin disease, a disease which forces her to quit her day job and stay out of the light of the sun. Working the night shift as a private investigator, Samantha is hired by Kingsley Fulcrum to investigate the murder attempt on his life, a horrific scene captured on TV and seen around the country. But as the case unfolds, Sam discovers Kingsley isn't exactly what he appears to be; after all, there is a reason why he survived five shots to the head.<br><br><b>VAMPIRE MOON (Book #2)</b><br><br>Samantha finds herself hunting down a powerful crime lord and protecting an innocent woman from her ruthless ex-husband―all while two very different men vie for her heart. And as the stakes grow higher and her cases turn personal, Samantha Moon will do whatever it takes to protect the innocent and bring two cold-blooded killers to justice―her own brand of justice.<br><br><b>AMERICAN VAMPIRE (Book #3)</b><br><br>Samantha receives a heartbreaking phone call from a very unlikely source: a five-year-old girl who's been missing for three months. Now on the hunt, Sam will use her considerable resources―including her growing supernatural abilities―to locate the missing girl before it's too late. And as she gets closer and closer to the horrible truth, she receives devastating news on the home front. Now with her world turned upside down, Samantha Moon is forced to make the ultimate choice of life and death.<br><br><b>MOON CHILD (Book #4)</b><br><br>Samantha is faced with an impossible decision―a decision that no mother should ever have to make. A decision that will change her life, and those she loves, forever. And through it all, Sam finds herself in a lethal game of vampire vs. vampire as a powerful―and desperate―enemy will stop at nothing to claim what he most desires.<br><br><b>CHRISTMAS MOON (Book #4.5, bonus!)</b><br><br>Now with Christmas just around the corner, Samantha finds herself taking on a very strange case. A mysterious family treasure has been stolen, something priceless that's been passed down through the generations, something buried in secrets.<br><br><b>Click BUY NOW or READ FOR FREE today!</b>";
