Each day is filled with abuse, both verbal and physical.</p> <p>Why? All because I was born an omega and not them. They make sure with each day that passes, I know just how little they think of me.</p> <p>There's one shining light in my lifeâ€¦ my best friend Sasha.</p> <p>She risks it all, deriving a plan for me to take my stepsister's place on a date. For once, I do something for myself and head to dinner with an unknown pack.</p> <p>Kismet bonds are once in a lifetime, and while I should be happy to have one, I know I'm not worth the risk.

Only fate has a different plan, and it seems my bonds have tracked me down.</p> <p>They're not the only ones, though. What we have may be kismet, but my stepmother won't stand for me to be happy. Now in true nightmare fashion, I'm sold off to a pack who wishes to bestow upon me the one thing I can't handle: an arcane bond.</p> <p>Will my happily ever after come, or am I doomed to live a life out of my worst nightmare?</p> <p><i>Welcome to the Murder and Mayhem Omegaverse world created by Cassie Lein and Bre Rose.</i></p>";
