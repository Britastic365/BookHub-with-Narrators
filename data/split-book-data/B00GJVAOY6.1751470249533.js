window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When Cade Walker and Merrick Sullivan find Elle hiding in the cabinet of a gun store, they know they can't just walk away from the fragile woman with no memory of who she is or who tried to kill her. Merrick is training for the title shot in the heavyweight division as a mixed martial artist and can't afford distractions, but neither can he turn his back on the woman who tugs at his heartstrings. Elle feels safe with her two protectors, and the longer she spends with them, the more she realizes that she has no desire to remember her past - not when it could compromise her future with Cade and Merrick. Cade has his own set of issues when it comes to Elle, and it quickly becomes clear to the two men that for the first time in their friendship, a woman is coming between them. But what if they just kept her there? Between them. Where she belongs.</p>";
