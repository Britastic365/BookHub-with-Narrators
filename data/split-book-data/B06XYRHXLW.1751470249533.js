window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Princess Avaegna of Tonyeh wasn't supposed to be married off to the Kohnzi warrior, Prince Stohsz. That was supposed to be her older sister's fate. She hadn't been raised as the usual Tonyeh woman, content to keep a house, raise children, and defer to her man. Indulged by her father and five older brothers, they taught her to fight, ride, and use a crossbow with deadly accuracy. But when her sister dies unexpectedly, she is required to step into her sister's tiny, pristine shoes. </p> <p>In the end, it is much worse for her than she could ever imagine, as she is stripped of everything she ever knew and brought to live with a man who seems to know her better than she knows herself - especially when it comes to handling her in - and out - of their shared bedroom. He makes discoveries about her deepest self and exposes them to her, forcing her to confront her darkest desires. </p> <p>After he kept her cloistered in his room for long, dark months, she is suddenly brought into the spotlight and required to accompany him and his warriors on a raid of a neighboring town - despite the other men's misgivings about having a female along. </p> <p>When push comes to shove, though, she is more than willing to fight for herself, and ends up getting much more than she bargained for. </p> <p>Publisher's disclaimer: Please be advised this book contains graphic sexual scenes and harsh, non-consensual discipline. </p>";
