And if I train hard enough, the government will assign me a pack before I even graduate.</p> <p>Sounds good, right? Except I have one little problem...</p> <p>My new pack doesn't want me. The Alphas especially don't want me touching their Omega. But what do I care? I only signed up for the trials so I could take care of my sick father. I just didn't expect to end up falling for their Omega… To make matters worse, he's also my scent match.</p> <p>Yet Gryphon, Oliver, Barret, and Lachlan will never let me be a part of their pack. I'm a Beta, after all. The spare. Not really wanted and not really needed.</p> <p>Spare <i>is a contemporary Omegaverse that will take you on an emotional rollercoaster from start to finish.
