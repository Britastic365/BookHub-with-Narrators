window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>It was like he had lifted the lid to a small locket box because a soft, beautiful melody began to play—happy and sad, and filled with love and loss. It was the song of us. The song of Life and Death.</b></p> <p>Centuries before the events of <i>Between Life and Death</i> and <i>Between Sun and Moon</i>... Centuries before she was Sage... She was Aurelia, the Goddess of Life.</p> <p>The decades-long Immortal War has ended, and a new deal has been struck between the two warring sides. In exchange for the freedom of others, Aurelia reluctantly agrees to live in the Spirit Realm, where she will give her hand in marriage to the God of Death—Von.</p> <p>The lethal, sexy, immortal claims he will make her his queen, but she knows full well that she will not be wearing a gilded crown upon her head, but rather a tight collar around her neck. Having no intentions of becoming his prisoner, on the day she is supposed to go with him, she makes a swift decision and runs from him instead.</p> <p>Thunderclouds and swords are not the only things that collide when Von tracks her down in the dark, foreboding woods. There, steamy passions and shadow chains lure Aurelia into making another deal with him—a deal that she won't be able to run away from this time. A deal that will forever lock her to his side.</p> <p>Right where Death wants her to be.</p> <p>Between the Moon and Her Night <i>is a prequel to the Between Life and Death series, but it is intended to be listened to as the third book.
