window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A dark force at work...</b></p> <p>Ava and Luc are asked to head north to Skäddar, a move necessary to save the alliance they have created with the mountainous country. Something terrible is killing Skäddar villagers and leaving messages behind with their bodies that the deaths will continue as long as the Skäddar are in alliance with the Rising Wave. If Ava and Luc can’t convince the Skäddar Collective to stand up for their new friendship in the face of the tragedy, they will lose a vital ally in the region.</p> <p><b>A dark room to cage a prisoner...</b></p> <p>Massi is deep inside Grimwalt, successful in her mission to find Ava’s incarcerated friends, Tomas and Velda. But the two are not being held alone. Massi finds many others being kept with them, as well as a prisoner kept in darkness whose power shines so bright Massi can’t imagine how the Speaker imprisoned him to begin with.</p> <p><b>A dark cloud that needs to be dispelled...</b></p> <p>Duncan has been held far from his home on the Skäddar border, and he takes the chance of escape that Massi gives him with both hands. When he and Massi have to part ways, though—Massi to get Ava’s friends to safety, him to return to the forest he was ripped away from—he can’t deny his attraction to the fierce archer or his reluctance to let her go.</p> <p>When he gets home and finds the power of his domain is being used to commit terrible atrocities, he’ll need Massi’s help—and that of her friends—to rid Grimwalt of the blight that is trying to take hold.</p> <p><i>Fate’s Arrow</i> is the third book in the Rising Wave series.</p>";
