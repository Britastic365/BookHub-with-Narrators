But Aurora - queen of Perceforest and queen of the Moors - is reigning under the weight of two crowns. Caught between the prejudices that divide her kingdom and eager to establish lasting peace, Aurora is determined to sign a treaty to unify the humans and the Fair Folk.</p> <p>But as spiky dark flowers grow fiercely around Perceforest’s borders and a stable boy mysteriously disappears, tensions between humans and faeries are at a dangerous high.</p> <p>It’s no help that Aurora hasn’t been sleeping. After all, how can she be certain she won’t wake a hundred years later? Moreover, she can’t be sure whom to trust. Her protective godmother, Maleficent; her sly advisor, Lord Ortolan; her devoted friend, Prince Phillip; and her new admirer, Count Alain, all claim to have her best interests at heart. And it soon becomes apparent that an underhanded plot poses unforeseen danger.</p> <p>With not only her peace treaty but also the safety of her loved ones at stake, it’s up to Aurora to trust in her own heart and save her kingdom.</p>";
