We have one month to choose a husband from among them.</p> <p>Only Elion, the arrogant, beastly ice lord, is forbidden. His torturous scars make the other women gasp. His icy words rip them to shreds. His touch is colder than frost. He lurks in the shadows, never coming out into the light.</p> <p>One stolen moment with Elion, and I'm intrigued. A kiss, and I'll do anything to call this brutishly handsome lord mine.</p> <p>Then one of the women is found dead.
