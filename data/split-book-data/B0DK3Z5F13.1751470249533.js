window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the author of </b><b><i>Four Steps to the Perfect Revenge</i></b><b> comes a deliciously witty and lighthearted romance brimming with misadventures, misdeeds, misunderstandings…and one perfectly mismatched couple.</b></p> <p>A notorious rule follower, the old Daphne Davis could do no wrong. But lately she can’t get anything right.</p> <p>Jilted by her ex, ousted from her home, and laid off from her job, Daphne retreats to her little hometown, Fernley Island. But even there, she feels out of sync. So, bailing on her own sister’s engagement party, she suddenly embraces a brand-new philosophy: no more goody-two-shoes.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Daphne’s new mantra lands her squarely in the headlights—literally—of her high school nemesis, Calvin Flint. No longer a scrawny jerk, he’s Fernley’s acting sheriff, filling out his uniform <i>waaay</i> better than he ought to.</p> <p>He’s also Daphne’s new boss.</p> <p>As Daphne balances the books after a department scandal, a series of mishaps throws her and Calvin together. The sparks that fly take them both by surprise. But will a fake dating scheme and quest for a stolen heirloom ruin their chance at something real?</p>";
