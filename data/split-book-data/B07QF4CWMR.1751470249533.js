window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A sexy stand-alone novel from <i>New York Times</i> and international best-selling author Elle Kennedy.</p> <p>Everyone says I’m a bad girl. They’re only partly right - I don’t let fear rule me, and I certainly don’t care what people think. But I draw the line at sleeping with the enemy. As the daughter of Briar’s head hockey coach, I’d be vilified if I hooked up with a player from a rival team.</p> <p>And that’s who Jake Connelly is. Harvard’s star forward is arrogant, annoying, and too attractive for his own good. But fate is cruel - I require his help to secure a much-coveted internship, and the sexy jerk isn’t making it easy for me.</p> <p>I need Connelly to be my fake boyfriend. </p> <p>For every fake date…he wants a real one.</p> <p>Which means this bad girl is in big trouble. Nothing good can come from sneaking around with Jake Connelly. My father would kill me, my friends will revolt, and my post-college career is on the line. But while it’s getting harder and harder to resist Jake’s oozing sex appeal and cocky grin, I refuse to fall for him.</p> <p>That’s the one risk I’m not willing to take.</p>";
