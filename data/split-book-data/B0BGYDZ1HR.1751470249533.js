window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The Demon King crossed over to our world looking for something that was stolen from him. What he found was me.</b></p> <p>It used to be that the president was the most powerful person in the country. That all changed when Wrath came to our world. He’s more powerful than anything we’ve ever faced.</p> <p>Now there are websites dedicated to worshipping him. Countless internet memes about how ridiculously gorgeous he is. And yeah, I can admit he’s fine as hell. But he’s a villain to end all villains. There’s no way I’m falling prey to that.</p> <p>That is until I accidentally cross paths with the Demon King and he demands I kneel at his feet. For a second, I almost do. Being around him is...<i>consuming</i>. But dying is better than surrendering, and I refuse.</p> <p>Except when Wrath turns his dark, dangerous power on me...it doesn’t work. And now the villain is looking at me like I’m the enemy.</p> <p>I manage to get away, but word quickly spreads--I’m somehow immune to the Demon King.</p> <p>Now Wrath is hell-bent on destroying me, and those who want to destroy him are hell-bent on using me.</p> <p>I’m no heroine. And I’m certainly no villain. But if I’m going to survive, I have to play the game. If the Demon King wants a fight, he’s going to get one. If only I could stop falling into his bed long enough to destroy him.</p> <p>Wrath &amp; Reign <i>is a villain enemies-to-lovers paranormal romance trilogy. You can expect lots of tension, action, twists, and hate kissing, and a villain you love to love. Please check the author's website for TWs.</i></p>";
