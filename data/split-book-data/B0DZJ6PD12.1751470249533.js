Lacklan Walker buries his father at the family graveyard in New England, the last person he expects to see at the funeral is his childhood friend and sweetheart, Marni — the woman who’d killed his father. To make things more complicated, his father’s dying wish was that Lacklan should look after her and protect her. Because Marni is on a mission, a mission to bring down the shadowy organization called Omega, the government within a government, a mission that might just save Mankind.<br> <br> But when Lacklan tracks her down to Tucson, Arizona, his biggest enemy turns out to be his own passion, his own need for redemption. A need that leads him astray and drags him ever deeper, as avenger and executioner, into the cross-border trade in crack cocaine and young Mexican prostitutes.<br> <br> But will his blind hunger for justice drive him to forget his promise to his father? Will it lead him to make the biggest mistake of his life – a mistake that could have disastrous consequences not just for him and Marni, but for the world…?</p>";
