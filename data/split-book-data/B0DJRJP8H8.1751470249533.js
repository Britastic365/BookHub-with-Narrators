window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The <b>PLAYING THEIR GAMES</b> box set includes three full-length reverse harem romance novels from the Beyond Huge Series. The stories feature stepbrothers, enemies-to-lovers, brother's best friends, friends-to-lovers, fake dating, forced proximity, and plenty of fantasies come to life!</p> <p><b>HUGE DARE</b> - Spending seven minutes in a closet with a stranger has to be the stupidest dare I’ve ever agreed to until it becomes seven minutes in heaven. As the door closes, not one, not two, but three bodies press against me. Six hands roam over places that haven’t seen action for months. Seven minutes pass in a flash, and when time is up, I stagger out of the closet a disheveled, satisfied, and intrigued mess. Because with just a glimpse of one tattooed hand, I know who achieved the unachievable. My stepbrothers knew how to blow my mind when no one had ever managed it before.<br> <br> <b>HUGE DEAL</b> - When my brother’s best friends walk in on me engaging in self-love, they offer me a deal that I can’t refuse. Why take care of my own pleasure, when they can do it for me? All I have to do is message, and they'll come running. Kain, Blake, and Dalton were our neighbors growing up. They offer me a deal to meet all my kinky fantasies, whatever they might be. Until I find a boyfriend, of course. Then the deal will be off. In exchange, I have to keep what we’re doing a secret, especially from my brother.</p> <p><b>HUGE GAMES</b> - Finding three fake boyfriends is the best way to heal a broken heart. When I discover my boyfriend Eddie has a side chick, I’m humiliated and furious. I don’t want him back, but I want him out of my head and my heart. My friends tell me the best kind of healing is the hot, sweaty, toe-curling, mind-blowing kind. So, on a drunken night, I take a chance and kiss three hotter-than-sin men until my knees are weak and my pulse is racing.</p>";
