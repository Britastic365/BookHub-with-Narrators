window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A passionate one-night-stand years ago leads to an unlikely friendship....</p> <p>Jackson James follows lots of rules. He has to. He’s a sheriff’s deputy. But strict adherence to the law during daylight has been enjoyably balanced by his own rakish regulations at night. Jackson, usually happy to protect and to serve (and serve, and serve), starts questioning his rules when wayward evenings begin to feel more like being waylaid rather than getting laid. The once laissez faire sheriff deputy can’t help but long for something real.</p> <p>Movie star Raquel Ezra follows only one rule: Always leave them wanting more. Strict adherence to this single rule has served her well. Studio execs, reporters, audiences, fans, lovers - no one can get enough of the bombshell. But when “generous offers” start to feel like excessive demands, years of always leaving has the habitually elusive movie star longing for something lasting.</p> <p>Seeking an escape, Raquel abruptly returns to the small hamlet of Green Valley, Tennessee, and her path crosses with the delectable deputy she spent one unforgettable night with years ago. However, when scandal and intrigue soon follow, Raquel and Jackson must decide which is more important: maintaining their rules? Or, at long last, finding something real?</p>";
