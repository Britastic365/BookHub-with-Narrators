Her enraged father has never forgotten.</p> <p>Now, Kane and Siobhan are finally getting married. They only invited a few people - including FBI Agent Lucy Kincaid and her husband, Sean Rogan - to celebrate. When Sean and Kane go missing the day before the wedding, Lucy must put her fear aside and work the case. Because someone believes that Siobhan knows where Hestia is...and will do anything or kill anyone to make her tell the truth.</p> <p><b>A Macmillan Audio production from Minotaur Books</b></p>";
