Her partner, Thrax, is a seven-foot tall Pitch-Blood/Dae’mon Kindred Hybrid who is growly and brooding and completely Alpha. Andi never guesses that her partner has a Shadowed Past until the two of them are sent to the Twisted System—a trio of planets where extreme sexual practices are the norm.<br> <br> On Salacious Delta, they must hunt for a lost warrior who has been kidnapped and taken to a Milking Farm—a cruel facility where males are being held against their will and “milked” for their seed. Under the guise of offering Thrax as a “stud” for the farm, they gain entrance to the hidden operation and make a plan to rescue the warrior and escape.<br> <br> But what Andi doesn’t know is that Thrax was once a captive himself. Being at the Milking Farm brings back past trauma and torment. When his buried memories comes back to haunt him, can the two of them deal with it together without blowing their cover? Or will Thrax lose himself in the shadows of his past?</p>";
