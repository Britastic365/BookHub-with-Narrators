window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When the evidence points to two realities, which will you believe?</p> <p>Two astronomers have detected a strange, pulsing signal from deep space. Within hours, the US government goes into lockdown, restricting airspace and scrubbing scientific data. Was the signal an intercepted communication revealing alarming plans for an enemy’s military strike? Or has humanity at long last found proof of extraterrestrial life?</p> <p>Caught between two mind-blowing possibilities, Dr. Veronica Chapel leaves her job as a high school science teacher to search for answers with her old friend Malcolm Feldman, a determined journalist, and Ada Park, a brilliant astronomer. Oh, and it also happens to be Dr. Chapel's one chance to redeem her destroyed scientific reputation, no pressure...</p> <p>As the group digs deeper, they uncover layers of mystery that challenge their grasp of the universe and their place in it. With time running out and the world hanging in the balance, they must navigate a tangled web of corporate secrets, government interference, and ethical dilemmas on a high-stakes journey to uncover a truth that will upend our understanding of the cosmos—and ourselves.</p> <p><i>The Signal</i> is directed, edited, and scored by Mark Henry Phillips.</p>";
