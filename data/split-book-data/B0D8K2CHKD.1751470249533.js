window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From </b><b><i>USA Today</i></b><b> bestselling author Layla Frost comes a grumpy-sunshine fantasy novel where opposites don't just attract… they're fated.</b></p> <p>Once upon a time, there lived a witch. A powerful, brilliant, dope-as-heck one whose magicks inspired fear and envy. Like all classic fairy tales, her story had the usual goodies.</p> <p>Destiny. Missing souls. Unfathomable evil. The precarious fate of the entire universe. Blah, blah, blah.</p> <p>But let's get back to that witch with the awesome hair…</p> <p>Fine, it's me. I'm the all-powerful witch. And, okay, maybe my story isn't a classic fairy tale. Not unless I missed the part about Little Red delivering comic books in her basket and Beauty sleeping off two-for-one margarita night.</p> <p>But I do have a soul mate—my very own Charming. Except he's no prince. He's a level-headed, by-the-book, insanely sexy detective.</p> <p>And me? Well, I'm stoned.</p> <p><i>This story starts where</i> Styx <i>leaves off, so although it features a new couple, it is highly (pun intended) recommended the books be listened to in order. Contains a dirty-talking hero, a filthy-minded heroine, and the hot magicks they create. For mature listeners.</i></p>";
