window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>My new neighbor happens to be the grumpiest billionaire in Whispers, but his gravelly voice and golden brown eyes make this city girl weak at the knees.</p> <p>When my life imploded and I lost my job and my fiancé in a matter of weeks, I didn’t know what my next step should be. Then I received an inheritance that would change my life forever. Moving to a small town and renovating the old farmhouse was a step in the right direction. But bickering with my startling good looking, yet much older neighbor was not part of my plan.</p> <p>Tanner Whiteman owns the largest whiskey distillery in the country, and now he wants my land. It’s the only thing that I have to my name and there is no way I am letting him take it. It is clear I am not cut out for country life and Tanner has no trouble pointing that out. Although as his eyes linger a little longer and his words take new meaning, even the massive age gap is not enough to stop us.</p> <p>But something does. Something vicious. Something unexpected. And not even the local billionaire knows what is coming.</p>";
