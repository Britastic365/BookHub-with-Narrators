Until a fae knight comes to my village and tells me that everything I know is a lie.<br> <br> It seems impossible, but he swears that I’m a fae queen, raised in the mortal realm for my own safety. And the time has come for me to return home to Faerie and rule.<br> <br> Only my queendom isn’t what it once was. It’s fractured, divided, broken. And the men of my royal guard—a group of deadly and eccentric warriors sworn to protect me—have disappeared, scattered to the wind. I have to reunite them if I want to have any chance of surviving the war that has consumed the land, and the invaders at our gates.</p> <p><b>This is a slow burn reverse harem novel intended for mature listeners only.</b></p>";
