window.bookSummaryJSON = "<h4><b>Tragedy, indescribable courage, and heart-wrenching secrets. It was her family’s history…one that she wasn’t aware of until recently.</b></h4>Shay was stunned to learn about her family’s tragic past…a history shrouded in secrets and from what she’d read so far in journals that dated back hundreds of years…there was good reason for the secrecy…fear was a huge motivator no matter the century.<br><br>She was equally surprised to hear from Patrick Johnston. He had questions about the Delasina family…questions that she wouldn’t mind knowing the answers to herself.<br><br>Patrick was making the trip to Iowa in an effort to find out if the reams of documents that Shay Green was in possession of actually contained any valuable information pertaining to the Delasina family and their connection to a certain piece of property in New Orleans. And while he might be making the trip as a favor to his brother, he wouldn’t mind learning the answers to why the house in question had some unusual architectural characteristics.<br><br>He figured that that it wouldn’t take more than a few hours to get the answers he was looking for and with a little bit of luck, copies of any documents that were worth adding to their growing archive on the historical property. If they answered even one of their many questions, he completely understood why she wasn’t comfortable adding it to her online genealogy page like so much of the other pieces of her family history that had made them aware of her connection to the Delasina family in the first place.<br><br>At most, he planned on being in his car and on his way back to New Orleans the next day.<br><br><b>That all changed when Shay Green walked out her front door moments after he pulled up in front of her house.</b><br><br>If you enjoy women’s fiction, characters who are strong and compassionate but are very rarely perfect, entangled and sometimes complicated family relationships, and a mystery that has no easy answers…the Secrets of the River series may be for you.<br><br><b>Secrets of the River series.</b><br>After Night Falls – Book One<br>Midnight in Darkness – Book Two<br>Deadly Serious - Book Three";
