window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Four men. One ritual. A kingdom of supernatural power at stake.</i><br><br>Heiress Olivia Blackwood has spent her life as magical royalty, her family ruling the supernatural criminal underworld for generations. Publicly, she plays the perfect daughter; privately, she's her father's most dangerous weapon, her telekinetic abilities honed to lethal precision. But when she uncovers her father's unthinkable betrayal, the carefully constructed façade begins to crumble.<br><br>Kidnapped by the notorious Valenti brothers, powerful magic users openly challenging her family's throne in the supernatural hierarchy, Olivia expects to become a hostage in their power play. Instead, she finds herself at the heart of an ancient magical conflict with implications beyond anything she imagined. The Valentis—commanding Rico with his pyrokinetic abilities, enigmatic Marco who communes with the dead, and intense Dante who manipulates the very essence of blood—along with their human security chief Adrian, offer an unexpected proposition.<br><br>As magical attacks escalate and hidden agendas emerge, allies become enemies and enemies become something else entirely. Now Olivia must navigate complex loyalties and forbidden attractions while uncovering family secrets buried for generations. In this high-stakes world where power recognizes power and conventional boundaries blur, she'll discover that what began as captivity might become her most unexpected freedom.<br><br>With a deadly ritual approaching that threatens to unravel the magical world's foundations, Olivia faces an impossible choice: retreat to the gilded cage of her past or stand with the men she's grown to care for in a dangerous gambit that could cost them their magic—or their lives. As the ritual's midnight hour approaches, Olivia must decide if she's willing to sacrifice the power she's always known for something far more dangerous: trust, vulnerability, and a future no Blackwood has ever dared to claim.<br><br><i>In the House of Shadows and Blood, some rituals bind. Others can set you free.</i></p>";
