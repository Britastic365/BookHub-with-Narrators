As a young boy without the bonds of Pack, he tried to stifle his animal nature.

Everything good in him died the day he was told that she, too, was dead. </p> <p>Talin McKade barely survived a childhood drenched in bloodshed and terror. Now a new nightmare is stalking her life - the street children she works to protect are disappearing and turning up dead. Determined to keep them safe, she unlocks the darkest secret in her heart and returns to ask the help of the strongest man she knows.... </p> <p>Clay lost Talin once. He will not let her go again, his hunger to possess her, a clawing need born of the leopard within.
