window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When she agreed to go on a date with quantum physicist Dr. David Fergusson, Kate Kallastad never expected that he would insist on demonstrating his breakthrough in the creation of a trans-space teleportation device. Nor did she expect to get caught up in a science experiment that would send both Kate and her date back in time. </p> <p>Stranded in the past with nothing but time on her hands, Kate accepts a job as a maid in the household of the gorgeous, commanding earl of Harrowby - a man unlike any she's ever met before. </p> <p>Brandon Ryder, the earl of Harrowby, has spent a lifetime bound by the rules of society, and one of those rules is that a gentleman doesn't trifle with the help. However, Kate Kallastad is no ordinary employee. His lovely new maid challenges him at every turn, astounding him with her audacity to treat him not as an earl but as a mere mortal man. Kate's honesty and comfortable familiarity dares Brandon to break free of boundaries that have long ruled him, enticing him to indulge in the truest passion of his life...and his growing passion for her. </p>";
