window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>My name is Victoria Brigham, and I'm a wolf-without the were.</p> <p>When I ran from home, I did it to protect my family from myself. I am not to be trusted. There's a creature living inside me that I cannot control. I was doing the world a favor by hiding, and doing what I did best: finding missing animals.</p> <p>But when my father shows up at my door and asks me to find my missing sister, I'm unable to say no because it's my sister, and my wolf's interested. And my wolf always gets her way. Except, when she's interested, people end up dead, too.</p> <p>I should have packed my bags and run away to the edges of the world that same night, but I stayed. And I searched. And I found much more than I bargained for.</p> <p>As if the wolf controlling me wasn't enough, a new set of powers is awakening inside of me, battling for dominance.</p> <p>The world had never really intended to leave me be, like I'd thought for five long years. Instead, it's throwing everything at me like it wants to find out just what my body and mind is capable of handling.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
