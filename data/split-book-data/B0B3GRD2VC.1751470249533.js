window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The stories were all wrong—Hook was never the villain.</b></p> <p>For two centuries, all of the Darling women have disappeared on their 18th birthday. Sometimes they’re gone for only a day, some a week or a month. But they always return broken. </p> <p>Now, on the afternoon of my 18th birthday, my mother is running around the house making sure all the windows are barred and the doors locked. </p> <p>But it’s pointless. </p> <p>Because when night falls, he comes for me<i>.</i> And this time, the Never King and the Lost Boys aren’t willing to let me go. </p> <p><b>NOTE: </b><b><i>The Never King</i></b><b> is a reimagining of </b><b><i>Peter and Wendy</i></b><b>. Characters have been aged up for this darker, grittier version. If you like your enemies to lovers romance with hot, ruthless, morally gray love interests, you’ll enjoy </b><b><i>The Never King</i></b><b>. You can expect hate kissing, fighting, bickering, and \"touch her and I’ll unalive you\" vibes. Book one ends on a cliff. </b></p> <p><b>Please check the author's website for CWs.</b></p>";
