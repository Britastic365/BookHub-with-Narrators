window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Now in a convenient audio bundle, here are the first three novels in Jill Ramsower's captivating <i>Five Families</i> Series. <br> <br> Love and danger are intertwined for the Genovese sisters as they're caught up in a dark web of schemes and violence, and find the ruthless men who will rule their hearts.<br> <br> <b>Forever Lies<br> <br> </b>When Alessia gets stuck in an elevator at work, she's trapped with Luca, the hottest man she's ever seen. But she can tell something dark hides beneath his charming facade, especially once he decides he's not letting her go.</p> <p><b>Never Truth</b></p> <p>Sofia swore she'd never forgive Nico for leaving her in darkness. When Sofia's powerful father hires Nico to protect her, Nico knows he'll never be strong enough to walk away from her a second time...but convincing her won't be easy.<br> <br> <b>Blood Always<br> <br> </b>Maria knows her arranged marriage is the best thing for her family, but she didn't count on her husband Matteo's ruthless determination to possess her--or their sizzling chemistry. Will they survive the passion that burns between them?<br> <br> <i>Author's Note: These are mafia romances intended for mature audiences with some elements that may be inappropriate for sensitive audiences. For those of you who are new to me, I write what I'd call \"mafia lite.\" My heroes are hardened criminals with soft spots for their heroines. There may be violence and cruelty in my books, but never between the main characters. Enjoy!</i></p>";
