Still, I’m determined to fight—to claw my way on shredded nails to survive.</p> <p>I can see Wyatt’s desperation to help. Most likely it’s out of guilt for rejecting me as his mate. But I can't risk trusting him again. Now, more than ever, I have to be strong.</p> <p>Wyatt</p> <p>I refuse to let Avery die, even if her withering glances threaten to burn me to ash. I tried to fight fate, but now I'm at its mercy.</p> <p>Still, I’ll do whatever it takes to protect my mate. Teeth bared, I will battle my way back to her side, even if she resists me every chance she gets.</p> <p>But little does either of us know, a prophecy is in the works, and Avery is the catalyst to it all.</p> <p>Will she allow me to stand at her side and face what's to come? Or will her isolated cries haunt me forever in the silvery moonlight?</p>";
