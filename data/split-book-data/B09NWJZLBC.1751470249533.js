Even before he spoke his name, his power all but drove me to my knees. </p> <p>Power that can pin me against a wall with just a thought and hold me there as he slowly cuts my clothes from my quivering body, making sure I know he is enjoying every blushing moment. </p> <p>Power that will punish me until I plead for mercy, tease and torment me until I beg for release, and then ravage me brutally over and over again until I'm utterly spent and shamefully broken. </p> <p>Power that will claim me as his forever. </p> <p><b>Publisher's Note:</b> <i>Thirst</i> includes spankings, rough sexual scenes, intense and humiliating punishments, and strong D/s themes. If such material offends you, please don't buy this book. </p> <p>Also note that an earlier version of <i>Thirst</i> was previously published under the title <i>The Devil's Game</i> as part of a multi-author collection entitled <i>Bite Me: A Vampire Anthology</i>.
