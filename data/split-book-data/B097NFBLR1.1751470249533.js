window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Love doesn’t have to be complicated, but sometimes life can get in the way. In his own words, speaking directly to the woman he’s falling for, Zach recounts a story of love and loss, uncertain whether this tale is one that ends in forever or is ultimately about the woman who got away.</p> <p><i>My Story of Us: Zach</i> is the first narrative in the Story of Us collection, modern love stories written as intimate correspondence from a man to the woman he’s falling for. Written and performed by Chris Brinkley, these stories are best experienced via audio.</p>";
