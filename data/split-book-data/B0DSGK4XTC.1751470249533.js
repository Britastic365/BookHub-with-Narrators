The cards were really stacked against me making good choices, folks.</p> <p>I was probably naïve to expect a call after that, but when he didn't, it hurt to accept he didn't feel that same connection I did.</p> <p>If that isn't a sign you need to make a change, I don't know what is.

Unfortunately, when you're a hopeless romantic spending that much time with someone you're attracted to in what might be the most beautiful place on the planet, things happen.</p> <p>And sometimes, to avoid those things happening, you come up with a list of rules to facilitate six months of secret, no-strings-attached sex with a man who is as off-limits as it gets.</p> <p>What could go wrong?</p>";
