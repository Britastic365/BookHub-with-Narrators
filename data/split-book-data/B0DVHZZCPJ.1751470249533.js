But stepping into Blackthorn Academy has unveiled me to the four most powerful men in the kingdom, and they have no intention of letting me go.</b></p> <p>Receiving an invitation to the academy was the first surprise. Me, a powerless half-blood, suddenly among the elite. I knew it was risky to go there . . . </p> <p>What I couldn't foresee was becoming indebted to the four royals—the brooding future king, his cunning brother, and their mischievous twin cousins. Now, I'm the sole focus of their domineering, possessive, but undeniably alluring attention.</p> <p>I can sense that they're carrying their own dangerous secrets, but my only wish is to fade away, to become invisible again. Yet, something irresistible is brewing between us, tempting me to surrender to what I know is impossible and can only lead to heartbreak.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
