window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Confidence is knowing what you're good at and what value you have in any given community and, because of this knowledge, you're able to act in a way that conveys this knowledge to other people. </p> <p>Confidence is one of our greatest personal resources. When we are confident, we can face almost any situation and we can come out of it better, even if we fail. Without confidence, we are destined to fail and possibly suffer because of it. It affects your professional and personal life. It shows up in social interactions, meetings, presentations, interviews, dates, and even in the comfort of your own home. </p> <p>There are many ways that confidence can make our lives better. For example, confidence can be more important than physical attraction in a romantic encounter. Don't believe me? Ever see those couples that don't look like they belong together? Maybe one is completely out of the other's league? Well, studies have shown that if you are confident enough, you can be seen as visibly more attractive in photographs and in real life. </p> <p>Studies have also shown that students who show confidence in school and who received expressions of confidence in their abilities can and do perform better than those who were told to aim higher and do better. </p> <p>If you want to be able to raise your confidence level, you need to know what confidence is and what it isn't. Confidence isn't arrogance (which is basically believing that you are better than you actually are). </p> <p>In this audiobook, you'll gain exclusive information on: </p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Confidence and cockiness </li> <li>Confidence in your professional life </li> <li>Confidence at home </li> <li>Confidence in your relationships </li> <li>Actions to boost your confidence </li> </ul> <p></p>";
