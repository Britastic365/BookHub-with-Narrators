window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>One winery. One cocky billionaire. One unforgettable mistake.</b></p> <p>Josh LaChappelle-Whittier is gorgeous, rich, and, unfortunately, the last person Elle Parker ever wanted to see again. She was supposed to pitch a marketing deal that could make or break a prestigious Sonoma Valley winery. Instead, she walked into the boardroom, locked eyes with him, and instantly remembered all the ways she got to know him the night before. Intimately. Thoroughly. Oh, so many ways.</p> <p>Josh is a legend in his own mind, a playboy with zero interest in running his family’s vineyard. Elle is on a mission to save it without getting distracted by the smirking, arrogant, infuriatingly irresistible man standing in her way. But the more time they spend together, the harder it is to ignore the fact that beneath all the teasing and tension, there’s something dangerously real between them.</p> <p>Josh and Elle are either about to screw up each other’s lives… or end up screwing again.</p> <p>- Billionaire Enemies to lovers</p> <p>- Close proximity &amp; workplace </p> <p>- One-night stand </p> <p>- Small-town &amp; found family </p> <p>- Feisty heroine vs. cocky hero </p> <p>- Set in the heart of Sonoma’s Wine Country.</p> <p>The LaChappelle/Whittier Winery Trilogy kicks off Sonoma Series, following five powerful wine families as they battle business, love, and the occasional disastrous tasting room mishap. But always have each other's backs.</p>";
