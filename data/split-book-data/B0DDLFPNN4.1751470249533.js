window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>For as long as I can remember, Lachlan West has been my brother’s best friend and the love of my life. Trouble is, he kissed me four years ago and then never spoke to me again. I was doing great pretending he doesn’t exist until I was assigned to write an article about former college athletes and I learn that the sexy single-dad is my first interview. Determined to wow my editor with an amazing sportsball piece. (Have I mentioned I know nothing about sports?) I head to Ember Falls, ready to face my fears—and the man I love.</p> <p>The grumpy quarterback turned fireman wants nothing to do with me or my article. Yet, somehow I persuade him to let me follow him around for a few weeks, and even if he said yes just to get rid of me, I’ll take it. But the longer I stay in his small town, the more complicated our story gets. The boundaries we set fall to the ground—along with our clothes. He holds me like I matter, touches me like I’m cherished and kisses me like he loves me. We both know I have to leave Ember Falls, and he’ll never follow—I only wish I could write a different ending to our story.</p>";
