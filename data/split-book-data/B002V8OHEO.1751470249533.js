Only Glorianna Belladonna possesses the ability to thwart the Eater's plans. But she has been branded a rogue, and must stand alone against the encroaching entity. <p>But she is not alone. In dreams, a call has traveled throughout Ephemera - \"Heart's hope lies within Belladonna\" - and reached Michael, a man with mysterious powers of his own. It awakens a fierce hunger within him to find the dark-haired sorceress he's dreamt of - a beautiful woman named Belladonna. Together, they may be Ephemera's only hope.</p>";
