The god-part is an exaggeration. After all, if true deities existed, then the world would be a magical place, and it's really not. At least, my world isn't.</p> <p>Calanthe Bloom. That's me. Twenty-four, college graduate drowning in debt, true crime addict, florist by default, single by design. Although not living my best life, I'm enthusiastically pursuing it. Especially, in my dreams, which, since a recent flower-delivery snafu, all feature none other than lethally private Tarian.</p> <p>Oh, the things he does to me when I sleep.</p> <p>Wickedly surreal.</p> <p>Except . . . are they?</p> <p>Enter a world of gods and monsters where dreams are made of flesh.
