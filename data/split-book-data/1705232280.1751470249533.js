window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Ashes to Ashes. Dust to Dust. If vampires kill your entire family, vengeance is a must. </b></p> <p>I can't say my parents never warned me about vampires. I just never believed them. Not - that is - until six months ago when vampires broke into my home and killed my family. Thanks to all the skills my parents taught me, I managed to escape but I couldn't save them. </p> <p>Two vampires down and the rest of the world to go. </p> <p>My bid for revenge is going to have to wait, though, because until I turn 18, I'm being placed in the loving care of Elizabeth and Jonathan McKnight - godparents I didn't even know existed. The clock is ticking until I can get back to my goal of eradicating the vampire race. But something is amiss at my new high school. </p> <p>According to my parents, vampires can't walk in daylight. So, why then, does Torin Priest? If he's not a vampire, then what is he? Because unlike the obnoxious asshole, Maverick McKnight, who sees me as some sort of bloodsucking leech on his wealthy family, Torin Priest is most certainly not human. </p> <p>To stake or not to stake, that is the question.</p>";
