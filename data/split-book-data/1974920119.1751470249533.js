But since I'm single, when my best friend and her husband finally decide to go on their dream honeymoon, she asks me to watch their three-year-old son, Max. </p> <p>Of course, I say yes.</p> <p>But what my best friend neglects to tell me is that I won't be babysitting alone. </p> <p>Thinking that Max might be too much for me to handle, her husband asks his only single friend, Nick, to help. </p> <p>Nick Carrington and I have met a couple of dozen times. I've never really given him a second thought - other than to say that he's kind of a jerk. Out loud. So he can hear. Sure, he's tall, dark, and handsome and has the best ass I've ever seen. </p> <p>But he always has to be the life of the party. He's arrogant. Imposing. Rich. And a playboy. </p> <p>And now I'm stuck with him...for two weeks! </p> <p>But what could possibly happen? It's not like we're going to fall in love or anything...right?</p>";
