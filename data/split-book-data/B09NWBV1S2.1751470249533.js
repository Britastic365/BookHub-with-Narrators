window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Packed with hideous nightmares, walking corpses, last-minute escapes, blood-sucking ghouls, and even true love, </b><b><i>Necroscope: Defilers</i></b><b> will more than satisfy any Brian Lumley fan! </b></p> <p>Jake Cutter is reluctantly learning how to be a Necroscope - how to use the Mobius continuum to travel instantaneously from place to place, how to talk to the dead - but dead humans don't like him much. It seems Jake's got a hitchhiker named Korath. Since Korath holds the key to the Mobius equations, Jake can't just kick him out....though he's certainly trying.</p> <p>Jake's not sure he really wants to be a member of E-Branch, the super-secret, ESP-powered organization that's dedicated to eradicating the vampire infestation of Earth. To the freewheeling, passionate Jake, the E-Branchers seem a little stuffy and hidebound - except for the lovely Liz, whom Jake wants to get to know better, body and mind. But Liz is a telepath, and if Jake's not careful, she'll find out about Korath. And that will likely be the end of Jake Cutter.</p> <p>In Australia, Jake helped E-Branch destroy the aerie of the mind-master, Nephtam Malinari - one of a trio of Great Vampires who came to Earth from the vampire world. Malinari escaped and went to ground with the hideously beautiful Lady Vavara. Vavara has taken over a holy monastery on a beautiful Greek island and turned the nuns into the most unholy creatures, with fearsome appetites for all things carnal.</p> <p>Jake wants revenge against the Italian mobsters who killed the woman he loved and nearly killed him. As far as he's concerned, E-Branch can search for Malinari, Vavara, and the metamorphic Lord Szwart without him, until he's satisfied his own bloodlust. But, it seems vampire hunting is truly Jake's job now - the men he's trying to kill aren't men at all, but vampire spawn, hidden for two generations in human guise! To defeat them, Jake will need every weapon in a Necroscope's arsenal, including the power to pull all the unsleeping dead out of their moldering graves.</p>";
