But when words uttered in the heat of combat are twisted against her, she is blamed for the prison break of three dangerous Alterants. She has one chance to clear the cloud of suspicion hanging over her—for good.</p> <p>All she has to do is recapture the escapees. But deals with gods and goddesses are tricky at best, and now the lives of all Beladors, and the safety of innocent humans, rides on Evalle’s success. The only person she can ask for help wants to see her dead. Then Storm shows up and complicates everything.</p>";
