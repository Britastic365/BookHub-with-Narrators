window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The second installment in Kresley Cole’s best-selling steamy Immortals After Dark series is now available on audio for the first time! </p> <p>Centuries ago, Sebastian Wroth was turned into a vampire - a nightmare in his mind - against his will. Burdened with hatred and alone for ages, he sees little reason to live - until an exquisite, fey creature comes to kill him, inadvertently saving him instead. </p> <p>When Kaderin the Cold Hearted lost her two beloved sisters to a vampire attack long ago, a benevolent force deadened her sorrow - accidentally extinguishing all of her emotions. Yet whenever she encounters Sebastian, her feelings - particularly lust - emerge multiplied. For the first time, she’s unable to complete a kill. </p> <p>The prize of the month-long contest is powerful enough to change history, and Kaderin will do anything to win it for her sisters. Wanting only to win her, forever, Sebastian competes as well, taking every opportunity - as they travel to ancient tombs and through catacombs, seeking relics around the world - to use her new feelings to seduce her. But when forced to choose between the vampire she’s falling for and reuniting her family, how can Kaderin live without either?</p>";
