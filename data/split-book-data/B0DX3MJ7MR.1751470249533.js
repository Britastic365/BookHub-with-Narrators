window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Assigned to an alien beast. Taught to serve and obey...</b></p> <p>Imprisoned on false charges, I find myself facing years in the worldship's brig. But when the Darrvasons, a race of powerful aliens in need of females, demand a sample of human women to examine, I'm offered up as a patient. In exchange for my cooperation, I'll be released from the brig, the false charges dropped.</p> <p>Obeying Dr. Zahhn, the musclebound alien who examines me, however, proves a challenge. His firm commands make me quiver with desire as he orders me to strip and assume a position that puts my feminine assets on full display. What follows is the most shameful yet thrilling two hours of my life. His methods are intimate and thorough as he tests my ability to physically mate with a Darrvason male.</p> <p>I think I'll never see Zahhn again... but when I'm later implicated in a traitorous plot and returned to the brig, my only escape is to become a Darrvason's mate. To my utter shock, I'm assigned to the arrogant doctor who made me shudder and climax on the exam table.</p> <p>There's no escaping Zahhn. He intends to keep me, and Darrvasons mate for life.</p> <p>Zahhn's Mate <i>is a dark romance that includes power exchange, spankings, and explicit scenes. For mature listeners.</i></p>";
