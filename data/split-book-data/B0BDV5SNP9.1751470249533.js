window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Leon</b> </p> <p>I earned my reputation among magicians for a reason: one wrong move and you're dead. Killer, they called me, and killing is what I'm best at. Except her. The one I was supposed to take, the one I should have killed–I didn't. The cult that once controlled me wants her, and I'm not about to lose my new toy to them.</p> <p><b>Rae</b> </p> <p>I've always believed in the supernatural. Hunting for ghosts is my passion, but summoning a demon was never part of the plan. Monsters are roaming the woods, and something ancient–something evil–is waking up and calling my name. I don't know who I can trust, or how deep this darkness goes. All I know is my one shot at survival is the demon stalking me, and he doesn't just want my body...he wants my soul.</p> <p><i>Her Soul to Take</i> is book one in the Souls Trilogy but it can be listened to as a standalone. It contains sexual scenes, kink/fetish content, horror elements and drug use<i>. </i></p>";
