window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A monstrous apparatus has been found on the surface of the moon. It devours and destroys in ways so incomprehensible to humans that a new language must be invented to describe it and a new kind of thinking to understand it. So far, the human guinea pigs sent there in hopes of unraveling the murderous maze have all died terrible deaths - except the last, now on suicide watch. The ideal candidate won't go insane, even as he feels the end approaching. And now they think they've found their man. </p> <p>Al Barker has already stared into the face of death - he can handle it again. But Barker won't merely have to endure the trauma of dying: he will have to endure it over and over again - mentally linked to an ongoing series of duplicates of himself created and sent to the Moon by matter transmission - until the artifact reveals its secret. </p> <p>With a cast of fascinating characters taking center stage, <i>Rogue Moon</i> is a rare thriller that doesn't just make you sweat - it makes you think. </p>";
