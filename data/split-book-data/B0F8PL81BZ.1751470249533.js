Green, an angsty, black cat x golden retriever romance about a team roping cowboy from Montana and the Texas girl who wants anyone but him...</b></p> <p>It's been fifteen years since the tragedy that took not only the life of Ellison Wilson's father but her entire world. Since then, she's done everything she can to separate herself from the thing they both loved: rodeo. But each year, on the anniversary of his death, she makes an exception for her mother and goes back to the place her heart once belonged.</p> <p>All Colter Carson wants in life is to rope steers, take home buckles, and make his family proud. After he lost his chance at love, he gave up on fairytales, focusing solely on being a cowboy. But Colter's never been known to back down from a challenge. So when the girl who wants nothing to do with him or his career stumbles into his life, the only thing he wants to do is win her heart.</p> <p>Nothing will change the fact that Ellison's dad is gone. And she's convinced nothing could change her view on the sport that cost him his life. Not her mother, not an act of God, and definitely not some cowboy from Montana who thinks he can sweep her off her feet and ride them into the sunset.</p> <p>When the road and the rodeo are all Colter's ever needed, what lengths will he go to get the girl and heal his own heart?</p> <p><i>Contains sensitive content.
