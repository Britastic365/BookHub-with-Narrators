window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>She’s broken free. But danger is in hot pursuit. And rescue is nowhere in sight.... Eve Duncan is on the run. Kidnapped by Jim Doane, a mysterious man who wants her to complete a sinister forensic sculpture, she now has no time to savor the victory of escaping from him. He’s back on her trail and closing in fast. At the mercy of the Colorado wilderness, she struggles to outwit and outrun him, but the odds are stacked high in his favor. </p> <p>Doane desperately needs Eve’s skill to reconstruct the skull of his son - a sick and twisted killer who still holds Doane in thrall from beyond the grave - and like a man possessed, he refuses to let anything stand in his way. The CIA has its own reasons for tracking Eve’s nemesis. And those closest to Eve - Joe Quinn and Jane MacGuire - are doing everything in their power to rescue her, while a hired gun named Lee Zander is on a personal mission to eliminate Doane. </p> <p>But does that mean he can be trusted to save Eve? Zander’s checkered history may be tied to Eve’s own past in a shocking way - or he may be nothing more than another assassin with a long-standing grudge and an overactive trigger finger. Using everything from cutting-edge technology to animal whisperers, the hunt for Eve is on. And the hourglass is almost empty.</p>";
