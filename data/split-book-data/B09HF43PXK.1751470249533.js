I can’t decide if I should punch him or drill him. it might end up being both. </b></p> <p>After more than a decade, the last person I expected to see walk into the Four Bears Construction offices as a new hire was Ridge. </p> <p>He was my first crush, and my first heartbreak when he started dating my sister. When he left her at the altar without so much as a note, I wrote him off for good.</p> <p>No amount of excuses and explanations can erase what he did. At least that’s what I keep telling myself. But when we end up being sent to a remote campground alone to spend a month rebuilding the cabins, it’s too easy to remember why I fell for him in the first place.</p> <p>I know the guys are all taking bets on how long it takes us to start playing with each other’s tools. </p> <p>It’s going to be a long month. </p> <p><i>Drilled </i>is a forced proximity, best friends-to-enemies-to-lovers, hilarious and steamy, final book in the Four Bears Construction series. It can be read as a stand alone but you won't want to miss this whole hilarious and hot series. No bear shifters, only the other kind of burly, hairy bears.</p>";
