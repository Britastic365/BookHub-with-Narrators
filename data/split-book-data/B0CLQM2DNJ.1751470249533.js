window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In Vakeeli, trust will get you killed....</p> <p>After being betrayed by one of the few people he trusts, Caz has become a prisoner in his own mind. For once, he can’t work his way out of a deadly situation...but with a mate like Willow, there’s always a way.</p> <p>With an ancient, powerful being like Decius, Willow has her work cut out for her, and after working with an old friend to cast a powerful portal spell, she winds up on Earth...with Caz at her side. But just because they’re on Earth doesn’t mean they’re safe. Though weaker, Decius still has the power to haunt them, and he will not stop until he has Caz in his clutches again...even if that means killing every single member of Caz’s Blackwater clan.</p> <p>With lives on the line and the clock ticking, the tethered couple must use earthly resources to find a way back to Vakeeli—without encountering Decius—so they can wake the Regal Selah and have her kill him for good. As they take this new journey, they’ll soon discover that not all Vakeeli history is true. Just as there are evil beings out to tarnish their Cold Tether, there are noble forces willing to aid them, and they go by the names Korah and Hassha, two Regal goddesses with more power in their pinkies than Decius will ever have.</p> <p>Caz and Willow only have one shot at a peaceful life. With Decius out of their way, they’ll be able to live freely as soulmates and without their Cold Tether in jeopardy. But as with any bold decision to work with powerful people, there are buried secrets and grueling consequences to face...and they’ll soon find out that Decius was only the start of their problems.</p> <p><i>Wicked Ties</i> is the heart-pounding, romantic, and gut-wrenching second installment of The Tether Trilogy.</p>";
