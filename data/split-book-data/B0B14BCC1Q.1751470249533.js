window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>This is a retelling of book one of Zodiac Academy from the perspective of Orion, Darius, Caleb, Seth, and Max.</b></p> <p>The Vega twins are alive. </p> <p>Those five words circle in my mind like an oncoming storm. They change everything about the future we thought had been set in stone. They challenge everything we were raised to be and the stability of the entire kingdom. </p> <p>They’re coming to our academy looking for the life that was stolen from them, but we can’t let them take it back. </p> <p>So much hangs in the balance and we can’t risk the arrival of two naïve princesses destroying everything we worked so hard for. </p> <p>I have trained in dark magic, overcome all challenges, and stood in the shadow of Lionel Acrux for far too long already. I won’t let them come between me and his downfall. </p> <p>Which means they have to go before they discover how powerful they truly are.</p> <p><b>This is a retelling of the first book in the Zodiac Academy series from the point of view of Orion and the Heirs and should be listened to after you have finished the original story. It includes scenes from alternative points of view, as well as over 50k words of additional content and scenes which have never before been revealed. So prepare to step into the dark minds of the Zodiac boys and watch out for the heartbreak and carnage that will ensue.</b></p>";
