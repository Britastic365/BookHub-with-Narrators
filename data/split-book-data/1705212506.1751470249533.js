Baptized in the gutter. </b></p> <p>I was raised by the violent laws of the streets, spilling blood without the hindrance of useless emotions or connections. Unfeeling. Unloved. Alone. </p> <p>My life was perfect. Until her. </p> <p>While on a manhunt for a mysterious enemy, one hellbent on taking both my business and my life, I find Mickey. She's covered in mud, rambling nonsense, and clearly out of her mind. She's also a distraction I don't need. </p> <p>That is until I discover a connection between the girl and my enemy. Mickey isn't a distraction anymore. She's the perfect weapon. One I'll use to exact my revenge. The plan is an easy one, but there's something about Mickey that's making it more and more difficult. A familiarity I can't place. A need I can't explain. A want I have to deny. </p> <p>After all, she's not mine to keep. She's a tool. My pawn. My sacrifice. </p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
