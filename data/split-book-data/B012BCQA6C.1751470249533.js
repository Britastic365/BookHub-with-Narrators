window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I am a successful businesswoman. I go to work and kick some ass. I go home to a loving family. I am happy with my personal life. I spend time with friends and loved ones. I find adventure when I need to spice things up a bit. My life is exactly what I've always wanted. </p> <p>Does that describe your life? </p> <p>Probably not, right? Otherwise, why would you be listening to this book right now? To be fair, I can't say that this describes my life 100% of the time either. However, I can honestly say that I get an overwhelming sense of pride and satisfaction out of my life and that I repeat that paragraph (and mean it!) at least once a week. Do you want to get to that point in your life too? </p> <p>It's not an inaccessible goal however it is a difficult one. If you are willing to put in the time and effort to make your professional and personal life better, then this is the book for you. </p>";
