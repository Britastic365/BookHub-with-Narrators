I’ve been in lava tubes in Hawaii and the concept of travel in them really hit home for me. Great story, always taking different turns, and a great ending.”</p><p>”... a brilliant adventure tale. ...I was thoroughly engaged from the arrival in Iceland until the last page. I was hooked by the fascinating concept, the realistic and surprisingly in depth characterization, and the plot which was studded with great complications and a feeling of urgency. The author gave credibility to his wild tale by his very realistic portrayal of some lovable characters whom I hope to encounter again very soon. Could be the next Indiana Jones series!”</p>";
