window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Clover Deering is living her best life. Kind of. Maybe. Okay, so, not at all. The owner of Fur-Ever Pet Spa is deeply in debt and battling a temper that scares even herself. Things go from bad to catastrophe when a terrifying man claiming to be a berserker king demands an impossible mission: force a rival royal to welcome evil into his heart. In exchange, he'll gift her with a prize she cannot resist—meeting the twin she never knew existed. The problem? King Viktor Endris isn't just scary, he's downright feral.</p> <p>When captured by Viktor, Clover enacts her own plan. Tame the unhinged warrior, turn him into an ally, and use him to rescue her sister. Not an easy task as Viktor is at war with ferocious turul-shifters, talks to an invisible friend and flips from controlled to chaos in an instant. As their undeniable connection deepens, she discovers a heartbreaking truth. Falling for her is Viktor's only path to ruin. Yet without his downfall, her twin's fate is sealed. The worst part? Clover just might be falling for him, too. But in the end, only one can survive. Her man, or her sister.</p>";
