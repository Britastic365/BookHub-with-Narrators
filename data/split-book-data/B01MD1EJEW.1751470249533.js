window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Jessica Charles shouldn't have even been in London when the unthinkable happened. She should have been back at home in Edinburgh, perhaps hanging with her boyfriend, having drinks with her sister, or doing yoga with her group of friends. She should have been going on in her normal, dependable life as always. </p> <p>But on that fateful day in August, when a mentally ill ex-soldier opened fire in public, Jessica's world changed forever. </p> <p>Now single and crippled from the gunshot wounds, Jessica finds herself scared and alone, losing faith in herself and humanity with each agonizing moment that passes. That is until a stranger enters her life. A stranger who makes her live again. </p> <p>Keir McGregor has always been the strong, silent type. Throw in tall, dark, and handsome, and you've got pretty much the perfect Scotsman. Except Keir is anything but perfect. He's got a past he's running away from and a guilty conscience he can't seem to shed. But the more time he spends with Jessica, the more he falls in love with her. And the more his secret threatens to tear them apart. </p>";
