window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>What would you do to save a loved one's life? Make a pact with the devil? </p> <p>In Diana Kingston's defense, it was the middle of the night in the deserted hospital chapel. Surely it was just a dream. She hadn't really sold herself to a brooding stranger to save her father's life, right? </p> <p>Then she wakes, and her father is fully recovered, and a mysterious letter arrives from the tall, dark, handsome - um, devil? Yep, it was right there on the contract, Lucien Star, aka Lucifer Morningstar, that had been his name in the dream.... Gulp. What would the devil himself want with her? </p> <p>Sex. Three months of hot, sweaty, Friday-night sex. Ooookay. Breaking a pact with the devil doesn't seem like a smart move. So she'll do it - but she won't like it. Not much anyway. </p> <p>But she starts liking it - a lot - and every night they spend together, she likes it and Lucien a little more. Being with him allows her naughty side to come out and play, but Diana starts to see more than just a sexy-as-sin, rock-hard...er...</p> <p>Anyway, he might be Satan, but even he was an angel once. Kind. Noble. And she sees glimpses of that man still inside him... But how in heaven's name do you save the devil from himself? </p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
