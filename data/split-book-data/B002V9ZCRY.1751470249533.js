window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The best-selling author of <i>Hide</i> and <i>Gone</i> draws us into the venomous mind games of her most terrifying killer yet. </p> <p><i>Come into my parlor...</i></p> <p>For Kimberly Quincy, FBI Special Agent, it all starts with a pregnant hooker. The story Delilah Rose tells Kimberly about her johns is too horrifying to be true - but prostitutes are disappearing, one by one, with no explanation, and no one but Kimberly seems to care.</p> <p><i>Said the spider to the fly...</i></p> <p>As a member of the Evidence Response Team, dead hookers aren't exactly Kimberly's specialty. The young agent is five months pregnant - she has other things to worry about than an alleged lunatic who uses spiders to do his dirty work. But Kimberly's own mother and sister were victims of a serial killer. And now, without any bodies and with precious few clues, it's all too clear that a serial killer has found the key to the perfect murder...or Kimberly is chasing a crime that never happened.</p> <p>Kimberly's caught in a web more lethal than any spider's, and the more she fights for answers, the more tightly she's trapped. What she doesn't know is that she's close - too close - to a psychopath who makes women's nightmares come alive, and if he has his twisted way, it won't be long before it's time for Kimberly, to... SAY GOODBYE</p>";
