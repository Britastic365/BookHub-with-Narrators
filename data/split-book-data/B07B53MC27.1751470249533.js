window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the </b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>and</b><b><i> USA Today</i></b><b> best-selling author of </b><b><i>The Vixen and the Vet</i></b><b> comes an unforgettable story about loss, redemption, and the healing power of love.</b></p> <p>My name is Cassidy Porter.... My father, Paul Isaac Porter, was convicted 20 years ago for the brutal murder of a dozen innocent girls.</p> <p>Though I was only eight years old at the time, I am aware-every day of my life-that I am his child, his only son. To protect the world from the poison in my veins, I live a quiet life, off the grid, away from humanity.</p> <p>I promised myself, and my mother, not to infect innocent lives with the darkness that swirls within me, waiting to make itself known. It's a promise I would have kept...if Brynn Cadogan hadn't stumbled into my life.</p> <p>Now I exist between heaven and hell: falling for a woman who wants to love me, while all along reminding myself that I must remain...Unloved.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
