Each one of them tough in their own way and part of a crew of mercenaries living on the wrong side of the law. </p> <p>Tank was his loving daddy. Pyro, the wild one, always pulled him into mischief. Boar taught him how to cook. And Drake showed him how to use knives in a wholly different fashion. </p> <p>All Clover wanted was to finally be an equal in the group. So, he trained, he pushed, and risked, but when real danger stared him in the face, he broke like a twig.</p> <p>Now, with one of his lovers taken, Clover can’t find a way back to his former self. Each of the relationships they’d so meticulously built is fractured, and it might never be the same.</p> <p>If their group is to ever be whole again, Clover needs to find the courage he’s lost, but that means facing the monster who scarred him and truths none of his men want to confront. </p> <p><i>Their Property </i>is a dark, gay, harem, contemporary romance and the third book in the Four Mercenaries Trilogy. </p> <p><b>Themes:</b> polyamory, mercenaries, bounty hunters, albinism, commitment issues, dark past, male bonding, human trafficking, size difference, danger, alpha male, found family, size difference, distrust, shared, victim and protector, revenge, organized crime, angst, trauma, rescue, missing.</p> <p><b>Please note: The story contains scenes of explicit violence, offensive language, morally ambiguous characters, and lots of scorching hot, emotional, explicit scenes.</b></p>";
