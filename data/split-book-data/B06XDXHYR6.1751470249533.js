Now, on her last leg, she has an opportunity to live if she mates a vampire. A real vampire. One night of sex and a good bite, and she'd live forever with no more weaknesses. Well, except for the vampire whose dominance is over the top, and who has no clue how to deal with a modern woman who can take care of herself. </p> <p><b>She might kill him</b> </p> <p>Jared Reese, who has no intention of ever mating for anything other than convenience, agrees to help out his new sister-in-law by saving her friend's life with a quick tussle in bed. The plan seems so simple. They mate, and he moves on with his life and take risks as a modern pirate should. Except after one night with Ronni, one moment of her sighing his name, he wants more than a mating of convenience. Now all he has to do is convince Ronni she wants the same thing. Good thing he's up for a good battle. </p>";
