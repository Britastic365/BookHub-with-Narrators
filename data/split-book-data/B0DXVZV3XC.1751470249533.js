He is, however, cunning and patient.</p> <p>Ryet, cursed by his demonic transformation, is bound by blood to Syrsee, a witch whose very existence fuels his hunger and his torment. Each drop of her blood brings him closer to becoming the monster he fears, even as their connection grows intoxicatingly intimate. Is it love between them? Or just an addiction?</p> <p>Paul, the creator, sees Ryet as his masterpiece, the key to his salvation—and his undoing. Driven by ambition and the promise of a legacy, Paul will stop at nothing to see his vision realized, even as it fractures the fragile bonds of love and loyalty he’s earned with Ryet.</p> <p>But it is Josep, favored and chosen by the Darkness itself, who holds the true power. As he wields his gifts to shape the future, his arrogance blinds him to forces conspiring for control.</p> <p>In a world of blood and magic, where power corrupts and love ensnares, the Darkness always demands more—and the battle for eternity is only beginning.<br> <br> Dark Poly</p> <p>Morally Black</p> <p>Forced Proximity</p> <p>Vampires Do Not Sparkle</p> <p>Uncontrollable Cravings</p> <p>Enemies to Lovers</p> <p>Power Imbalance</p> <p>Road To Hell</p> <p>Anti-Hero</p>";
