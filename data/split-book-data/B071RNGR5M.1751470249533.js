window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Tek Harlow and Mari Buchanan had been on again off again lovers for years, even though her family forbade it. When Mari came back to town - again - and decided she wanted to become more involved in her extended, intricate family's life, that came with the restriction that she and Tek not see each other at all. </p> <p>But the werewolf pack's second in command and the sister of the current pack leader found it nearly impossible to keep their hands off each other, until her brother discovered they'd been ignoring his rule all along. His ultimatum was harsh and succinct: either stay away from each other and be a part of the pack, or continue as they were and be shunned forever. </p> <p>Although they made the unenviable choice of deciding to remain within the fold, a near tragedy may prove to pave the way for them to come together permanently, with everyone's blessing. </p> <p>Disclaimer: <i>Packed, the Enforcer</i> is the love story of Tek, a werewolf enforcer and Mari, sister of the Alpha. Tek and Mari are a combustible duo, and their romance contains graphic sexual and spanking scenes. </p>";
