Especially not tall, dark, and sinfully handsome Tristan - a man hard to resist and determined to fulfill her every desire. </p> <p>Though Tristan was a rogue of the battlefield and the boudoir, making love with Julia was like nothing he'd ever known. Yet revealing his true heart would break the centuries-old spell and separate them forever. And Tristan would do anything to go on loving Julia...even remain a slave through all eternity.... </p>";
