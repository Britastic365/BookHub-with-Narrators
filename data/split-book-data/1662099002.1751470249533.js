window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Willow </b></p> <p>After being left for dead I was given a fresh start. I could go anywhere in the world yet all I wanted was to stay where I was. Even though I knew I was safe. I always had a bag packed and ready just in case I needed to escape again. Like they say, old habits die hard. Being in the shadows is lonely, but lonely is safe. No one saw me. No one really got to know me. Except him. </p> <p><b>Quinn </b></p> <p>Being a cowboy is in my blood, just like my father, and his father before him. Except unlike my father the only thing that interested me were my horses. I was the quiet one, the one who stood in the back and watched things unfold. Until I found her fighting for her life. Something inside me shifted. I couldn’t stop it, I fell in love with her. Even though I knew, in the end, she would leave me.</p>";
