window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>She’s a lone wolf, raised to combat. But fighting him isn’t what she wants. </b></p> <p>Elliot Smith has trained hard to live and work alone, even in her job as a security specialist for JCL Security. No relationships, no ties, except the one to the man who kidnapped and murdered her mother. She’ll do anything to kill Martin Diako, the untouchable South African pirate king. When Deacon Walsh walks into her office, she finally sees a chance to do just that. </p> <p>Deacon went from soldier to mercenary warrior to stay-at-home dad, and now his past is back to haunt him. Martin Diako, the father of the terrorist Deacon killed two years ago, is coming for revenge, and he has his sight set on Deacon’s daughter. An heir for an heir. Deacon will do anything to protect her, even if it means asking for help. But the security team he’s hired comes with an added complication: the only woman to interest him since his wife died. </p> <p>Deacon always leads his team, and Elliot protects hers. They might have one chance at their enemy - if they can work together. Will their hunger for each other pull them together, or push them apart?</p>";
