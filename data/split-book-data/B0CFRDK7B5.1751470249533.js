window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>All I ever wanted was to keep her safe. The last thing I expected was to fall for the bastards trying to hurt her.</b></p> <p>The Reapers of Caspian Hills are powerful men. So powerful that when my idiotic stepfather offered them my little sister, I knew no one in their right mind would try to stop them. But I never claimed to be totally sane.</p> <p>Offering myself in Alex's place was borderline suicidal, but I strolled into the lion's den anyway. While the brothers definitely lived up to their ruthless reputation, I discovered they had a weakness after all—me.</p> <p>Belonging to these men put an immediate target on my back. Now that we've grown closer, every stranger I meet may be secretly out to get me. In this world filled with violence, deception, and cruelty, I've never felt more at home.</p> <p>Our enemies may think I'm just an insignificant little pet to Atlas, Ezra, Tristan, and Cyrus, but they'll soon find out… I am their Queen, and damn, was I born to wear this crown.</p> <p><i>Queen of The Reapers </i>is book two of The Reapers of Caspian Hills, a dark mafia series where our heroine will end up with multiple love interests. This book ends on a cliffhanger, and their story will end with a HEA in book three. Intended for mature listeners.</p>";
