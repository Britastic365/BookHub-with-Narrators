window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I’m kind of a bitch, but you would be, too, if you had my life.</p> <p>I was taken as a baby and trained to become an elite member of Troupe Delirium. My time with them is as permanent as the damn collar on my neck. Until Heathcliff helps me escape.</p> <p>I have nothing but the clothes on my back and the good sense to get as far away as I can. But then, I stumble into someone else’s territory and get snagged by a shifter-happy cop who brings me to a pack. </p> <p>Pack Aberrant. The only shifter pack in the world that would actually be willing to help me. Before I know it, I’m getting attached to an enforcer, and I’m fighting for these misfits who, somehow, thawed my heart.</p> <p>But I know better. My old master is coming for me, and Heathcliff...I can’t ever really move on without Heathcliff. I guess I won’t really need to, though. There’s no way I’m making it out of this alive.</p> <p><b>Author's note:</b> This is book three in the Pack of Misfits series. Every story is a stand-alone, but it is best if you start with Addie's book. Each book will have a different mate dynamic. (M/F, RH, or menage.) Intended for mature audiences 18 years and older. Expect a take-no-shit female, humor, heat, and plenty of action. This one is a wild ride.</p>";
