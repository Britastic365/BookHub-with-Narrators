window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Brian Lumley's Necroscope novels are one of the horror genre's most towering achievements. They chronicle the adventures of Necroscope Harry Keogh, his successor, Jake Cutter, and the psychically gifted agents of E-Branch, Britain's super-secret spy organization, and their battles against the malevolent, shape-shifting Wamphyri and their spawn. Their exploits have spanned two worlds, 13 novels, and an infinity of time. The Necroscope novels have sold more than two million copies in English alone. </p> <p>Harry Keogh has triumphed over much adversity in his life, from the death of his mother and the discovery of his amazing powers - to talk to the dead and to travel instantaneously to any place via the Möbius Continuum - to the fallout from his war against the vampires. He lost his body, though not his life; his wife and infant son disappeared without a trace; and he had to kill a woman he had come to love. What should have been a joyful reunion with his son was tinged with horror when Harry realized that his boy - now a man-was half - Necroscope and half-vampire, and thus a deadly double threat to all mankind. Father faced son in a terrible battle, and when it was over, Harry awoke safe in his own bed, at home...but his Necroscope powers were gone, locked away in the depths of his mind! </p> <p>Now, a new evil rears its head in the Balkan Mountains. Janos Ferenczy, master vampire and black magician, has risen from an ages-long sleep. As the first step in his plans of conquest, he conjures dead men and women into a perverse semblance of life and subjects them to fiendish tortures. But the shrieks of the dead barely begin to satisfy Janos's bloodlusts as he prepares an army of undead warriors to conquer the world. </p> <p>The dead try desperately to attract the Necroscope's attention, but Harry Keogh is deaf to their pleas and their screams. As Harry searches for a cure, he learns that to save mankind he must ally himself with the crafty father of vampires, the infamous Faethor Ferenczy. Centuries dead, Faethor lies in his grave and schemes. He will help Harry defeat Janos - but his price will be very high indeed!</p>";
