window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>There wasn’t too much in my life that I could complain about; I had a career that I loved, a group of friends that I would do anything for - who had my back in return - and my family wanted for nothing. Most importantly, I was content with pretending that I didn’t want something that I couldn’t have anyway. The desire was always there, but there were rules in place that were never to be broken. </p> <p>But then those rules were shattered when two of my friends hooked up, and my world instantly tilted on its axis.</p> <p>Once Shad and Aisha became a couple, the urges that I’d suppressed for years not only resurfaced but demanded that I take action. With my number one excuse no longer viable, the only thing standing between me and the woman I love is the fact that she doesn’t take me seriously. I’ve never backed down from a challenge in my life, and I’d be a fool to start when what I want is so close that I can taste her. Instead of trying to explain to Monie that we were perfect for one another, I was going to convince her of it by showing her that I’d always been the man she needed.</p>";
