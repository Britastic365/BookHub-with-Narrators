window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From <i>USA Today </i>best-selling author Rina Kent comes a new stand-alone dark college romance.</p> <p>I’m out for revenge. After careful planning, I gave the man who messed with my family a taste of his own medicine. I thought it’d end there. It didn’t.</p> <p>Landon King is a genius artist, a posh rich boy, and my worst nightmare. He’s decided that I’m the new addition to his chess game. Too bad for him, I’m no pawn.</p> <p>If he hits, I hit back, twice as hard and with the same hostility. He says he’ll ruin me. Little does he know that ruination goes both ways.</p> <p>This book can be listened to on its own, but for a better understanding of the world, you might want to start with <i>God of Malice</i>.</p>";
