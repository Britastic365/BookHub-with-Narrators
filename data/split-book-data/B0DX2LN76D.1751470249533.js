window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the author of Tell Me Goodnight and Warrior Blue comes an emotional romance about a writer and the bartender she befriends after finding out she's unexpectedly pregnant. Two little, pink lines should have been a good thing, but for Kendall Wright, it felt like the end of the world. Especially when her career as a successful romance novelist had only just begun to take off.</p> <p>But with the acceptance of her flaky boyfriend, and the help of a friendly bartender, she begins to see how those two little, pink lines could actually be a blessing.</p> <p>Except pregnancy isn’t always what it’s cut out to be, and sometimes, things can take a turn for the worst when you least expect it. And after an emergency C-section, the premature birth of her son, and the loss of that flaky boyfriend, Kendall begins the hard, rewarding, and oftentimes traumatic life of NICU parenthood alone.</p> <p>But soon, she realizes that, where there is darkness, there is usually light. And there are always friendly—and very attractive—bartenders.</p>";
