I turned on the charm to win him over, only to get friend-zoned. The more time we spend together, the more glimpses I get of the Daddy he’s hiding under his no-dating-allowed exterior. Unfortunately for Saint, a Daddy is exactly what this boy is looking for.</p> <p>I have no intention of staying friends with him, but with every platonic interaction, I start feeling things I never have before. And not just about the sexy Scottish object of my affection.</p> <p>I wasn’t looking for someone to fix me, but if I let him in, we might have something amazing here. </p> <p>If we can just shake the ghosts of the past....</p> <p><b><i>Fix Me</i></b> is a Daddy/boy story with a doting but reluctant Daddy, a bratty party boy in need of some structure, and fun times with a kilt. It is Book Two in the Tattoos and Temptation series, featuring hot Miami nights, Latin desserts, and guys with ink.</p> <p>It can be listened to as a stand-alone.</p>";
