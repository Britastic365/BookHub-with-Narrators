window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I have a special power, the ability to calm a berserker, but I’ve been warned never to use it. My mother said, “If you see a berserker in a rage…not your monkeys, not your circus. Get the hell away. They’re too dangerous, and you’ll lose your freedom.”</p> <p>But the thing is…we’re flying 30,000 feet in the air in a speeding aluminum cage, and there’s a berserker raging out in the aisle beside me. Security won’t be able to hold him. They won’t be strong enough. They have no idea what they’re dealing with. And if he gets a taste of blood, he’s going to rampage through the entire plane, leaving a path of death and destruction, including me.</p> <p>I’ve never used my power before. I’m afraid it won’t work and he’ll turn on me, but I know all too well what these beasts are capable of. There’s nowhere to go, and he’s just getting started. I have one option: calm him and hope I can escape when the plane lands.</p> <p><b>This is a stand-alone. No cliffhanger. Guaranteed happily ever after.</b></p>";
