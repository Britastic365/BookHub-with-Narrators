I’ve always been a little off, but it took stumbling into a backwater bar to understand how different I really am. </p> <p>So when two drool-worthy guys stop by to tell me that I’m Hell spawn just like them, I’m more relieved than shocked. I mean, it sure does explain a lot. </p> <p>Now, I just have to convince my mama and daddy that they can’t come with me on my first trip to Hell, deal with a hellish biological family I never knew I had, and keep from getting kidnapped by some weird Morax fella with snakes for hair.</p> <p>Things are about to get crazy around here. I guess it’s a good thing I like that.</p>";
