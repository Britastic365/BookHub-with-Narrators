Since a return journey is impossible, she does what archaeologists were born to do and searches for clues among Mayan ruins on Earth.</p> <p>What she discovers in the jungle will reveal a mystery far older than she thought possible, with roots winding back through through the centuries...and will eventually lead her to a primeval well of power that threatens the safety of both worlds.</p>";
