window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A spicy, only-one-bed Formula 1 romance from </b><b><i>New York Times bestselling </i></b><b>author, K. Bromberg.</b><br> <br> Surely this can’t be the only solution to overhaul my tarnished rep—faking a romance with the good girl intern?<br> <br> But that’s what my agent says. Just a few months of taming my ways—of shedding Formula 1’s party boy image—will land me a lifetime branding deal. One I desperately need.<br> <br> <i>The key condition</i>?<br> <br> Pretend I’m madly in love with my new girlfriend. The quiet wallflower who I figured wouldn’t put me in my place. Yeah. This girl is <i>anything</i> but that.<br> <br> Maddix Hart is defiant and intelligent. Loyal and <i>real</i>. Determined and sexy. And damn it to hell, before I know it, she’s in my head, in<i> our </i>bed . . . and if I’m not careful, she’ll see there’s more to me than the man I show the public. <i>She’ll discover the man I hide from the world.</i> The one who struggles to live up to the unrealistic expectations that should never have been mine.<br> <br> All I have to do is make sure no one sees the truth behind our farce.<br> <br> But instead, I let my heart get involved. <i>I begin to believe the lie</i>. And now with everything on the line—the deal, a championship, <i>us</i>—am I willing to risk it all to make her see what the rest of the world believes? <i>That we belong together</i>.</p>";
