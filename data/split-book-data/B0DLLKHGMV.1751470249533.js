window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>My life was magic in a shattered bottle...</i></b><br> <br> I feel like I’ve done this before. Except…not exactly like <i>this.</i><br> <br> There’s zero logic behind this feeling I have, this feeling that I’ve woken up in this hospital before. The doctors insist I’ve been in a coma since Halloween and only just woke up. Yet I remember waking up and seeing my best friend sitting by my bed but she’s not here now. I remember meeting two nurses who the doctors swear don’t exist. They say the mind is a complex place and it was just a dream, an unconscious desire to wake up. But I can see it clearly in my mind and no dream has ever felt more real.</p> <p>Just when I’ve convinced myself the doctors are right, that science knows best, my aunt and uncle tell me that I’m a witch.<br> <br> A <i>witch</i>.</p> <p>I thought they’d lost their minds or were playing a prank…until I leave the hospital and find we’d moved hours away to a small community of witches. All I want is for this nightmare to end and for my life to return to normal. But my magic is too powerful to ever go back to life before the accident. They tell me my magic is the only reason I survived, yet I can’t shake this feeling that I’ve lost something <i>huge</i>…and the phantom pain isn’t the only thing haunting me. Something lurks in the shadows of the night and I’m afraid it might catch me before the truth comes out.</p> <p>Because the more time I spend among witches, the less I know what’s my imagination and what’s real…</p>";
