window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>A very vampy Christmas...</i></b></p> <p>This is it. The moment I’ve been waiting for. Christmas on Megelle Island is the biggest event of the year, and somehow I've been hired to plan it all: parties, activities, festivals, and the Christmas Eve ball at the palace. So what if I'm a last-minute substitute because the old party planner got run over by a reindeer? So what if the King and Queen ask me to also plan their son’s engagement party within six days? So what if the cottage I rented was accidentally double booked and now I have an ancient, brooding vampire breathing down my neck every day? None of that matters. If I succeed, this job will make my career skyrocket…but if I fail to satisfy the King and Queen then I could find myself blacklisted and out of a job.</p> <p>It's make or break it time. Nothing is going to stand in my way.</p> <p>Especially not the sharp-tongued, sapphire-eyed Lexington Prescott who smells like lavender and snow. Does he like me? No. Do I like him? Not one bit. Does his scowl give me butterflies? Definitely not. I'm a professional. I can pull this off, I just need to ignore this passion a little bit longer...after all, what could possibly go wrong?</p> <p><b>*Part of a mini-series but can be read as a standalone, in any order with the others</b></p>";
