I never pretended to be the good guy. </p> <p>She was the opposite. </p> <p>But the minute she pulled the curtains back and saw my face, watched me screwing the blonde who happened to be my next mark, she sealed her own fate. </p> <p>There could be no witnesses, ever. </p> <p>I let it go on a few days though. Never closed the curtains, gave her one hell of a show. I liked it, liked seeing her get all hot and bothered. Her face so innocent, so...corruptible. And all that time she was watching, she had no idea I'd seen her, that I was watching her too. </p> <p>But all good things must come to an end. </p> <p>Imagine my surprise when I turned up to take care of her only to find two goons breaking down her door, weapons in hand. </p> <p>Turned out she had a price on her head. Her stepbrother wanted her and he wanted her alive. I'd never been one to pass up an opportunity to collect the kind of money he was offering, especially if I could have some fun while I was at it. </p> <p>It just never occurred to me she'd be anything more than my next mark. </p>";
