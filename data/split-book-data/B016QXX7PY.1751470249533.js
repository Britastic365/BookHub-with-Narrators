window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In an all-new series, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Yasmine Galenorn invites listeners to Whisper Hollow, where spirits walk among the living and the lake never gives up her dead. </p> <p>Fifteen years ago, I ran away from Whisper Hollow, Washington, a small town on Crescent Lake in the Olympic Peninsula. But truth is, if you were born here, you can never really leave. I'm Kerris Fellwater, and when I returned, I inherited my grandmother's house - and her gift. As a spirit shaman, it's my responsibility to drive the dead back to their graves because around Whisper Hollow, people - and secrets - don't always stay buried. </p> <p>When I was little, I was told my mother ran off. But now it looks like she was murdered. With the help of my mysterious neighbor, Bryan, we begin to unravel the mystery of her disappearance and in doing so unearth a dark force seeking to bury Whisper Hollow. Now I must work with the dead rather than against them because our enemy will do whatever she can to destroy the town, and she means to start with me. </p>";
