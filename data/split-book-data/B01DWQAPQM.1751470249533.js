window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>If you would've asked Raven four years ago if she was in love with Linc, she would've answered, \"Yes!\" in a heartbeat. Now three and a half years later, the thought of Linc instills nothing but anger and hurt - Linc broke her heart into a million pieces, and ever since she's been trying to piece her heart back together. When Linc was given the opportunity of a lifetime that meant he was one step closer to being in the PGA, he knew what he had to do - walk away from Raven and sacrifice his happiness for his dreams. He had no idea that his decision to go to Scotland would haunt him for years to come. Fate tore Linc and Raven apart, now in a surprising twist it's bringing them back together - but the question is: Can they let go of the pain from the past giving them a fighting chance at finally having a future together? </p>";
