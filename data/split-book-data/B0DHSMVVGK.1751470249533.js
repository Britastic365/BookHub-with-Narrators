window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It’s no secret that I’ve been in love with Jax Cartwright for half my life. A terrible decision, really, and not just because he’s my brother’s best friend or he’s ten years older than me. Thanks to an overprotective family, he’s ignored me for years, but still, I can’t get his grumpy a** out of my head. And in a wine-fueled, post-bad date funk, I make another terrible decision: show up at his cabin to ask why he’s never given me a chance. The storm that got me stuck there overnight was a total fluke, but I’m no fool. While Jax is perfectly clear about not wanting a family or love or any of the happily-ever-afters I’ve dreamed of, what’s the harm in asking for just one night? The worst thing he can say is no.</p> <p>He doesn’t though, and I was saying yes, yes, yes a whole lot after that.</p> <p>Best. Decision. Ever.</p> <p>One night is enough to feel like I can move on, and we agree to let it be a secret kept safe between us.</p> <p>But you know what makes it hard to keep a one-night secret about my not-so-secret crush?</p> <p>A positive pregnancy test. Oh baby, things are about to get interesting.</p>";
