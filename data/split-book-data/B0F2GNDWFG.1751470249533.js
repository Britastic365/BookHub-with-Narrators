window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>If there is one lesson I’ve been taught in my life, it’s that fairies are the absolute worst.</p> <p></p> <p>Finding a fledgling succubus in Faerie is like locating a needle inside a realm-sized haystack. With a guide I can’t trust and a goal more ephemeral than smoke, my odds of success are tenuous at best. Not to mention, as the last Elemental in existence, I have a giant target painted on my back.</p> <p></p> <p>Because one half of Faerie wants me dead, and the other half wants to use me as a sacrifice to open the gates to Earth. But I swore I would find my quarry, and I will. Even if I have to rip the entire realm apart to do it.</p> <p></p> <p>There is a storm coming to Faerie. And that storm is me.</p> <p></p> <p>Priestess of Storms &amp; Stone is the fifth book in the Rogue Ethereal series. If you enjoy foul-mouthed heroines, dark humor, and enemies-to-lovers, then you'll love this series.</p>";
