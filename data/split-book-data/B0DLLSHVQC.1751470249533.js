window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>“I won’t let anyone hurt him. Even if he can never be mine.”</p> <p>Ezra. Escort. Cynical. Hunted by a killer. Needs a man capable of anything.</p> <p>Frank. Client. Protective. Loyal. Wants to forget his violent past.</p> <p>On his 40th birthday, Frank decides his chance for love has passed. But when an old friend treats him to a night with a beautiful escort, Frank is not about to say no. In fact, Ezra proves to be so intoxicating, he doesn’t want to let go. So he’ll pay.</p> <p>An easy solution to loneliness. No strings, no expectations, a clean transaction and a bit of extravagance in his otherwise frugal life. That is, until one night Ezra arrives on his doorstep, desperate for protection from none other than Frank’s old buddy. A man as dangerous as Frank used to be.</p> <p>Ezra has a very clear goal in life—make a load of money while he’s young and beautiful, then marry rich. His rules are just as simple: stay safe and don’t fall for clients. Frank might be Ezra’s type: big, rough around the edges, and generous in bed, but Ezra is level-headed enough to know that a guy who works at a junkyard and doesn’t exactly own a yacht isn’t marriage material. But Ezra is in danger, and he needs a man with massive fists, not deep pockets, so he will do everything in his power to secure Frank’s affection.</p> <p>Only Frank never planned to get involved with his little treat. Because if Ezra knew his dark secrets, he’d be terrified of what kind of monster he’d let into his bed.</p> <p>WARNING: This story contains scenes of violence, offensive language and morally ambiguous characters as well as the topics of domestic violence, eating disorders and fatphobia.</p>";
