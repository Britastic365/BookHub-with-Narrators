window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I had one job: keep her safe. But instead of doing my duty, I’d nearly lost her more than once.</p> <p>In my defense, what does the Horseman War know about stopping the apocalypse? Nothing. My goal has always been to fight and raze my enemies to the ground. Merri wasn’t an enemy, though she felt like one. In a matter of weeks she’s found her way through each and every one of my defenses. In fact, she’s done that to us all.</p> <p><b>Sinclair</b></p> <p><b>Malice</b></p> <p><b>Grimsby</b></p> <p><b>And me, Chaos.</b></p> <p>My name has never felt more fitting, because chaos is exactly what she’s unleashed within me. These days I can hardly tell if I’m coming or going. Everything I thought I knew has been turned on its head because of her.</p> <p>Forced to abandon our home, we’re isolated together on a remote island in France. Off the grid. Hidden from detection. Ever closer to Doomsday, we have to get our job done and put a child in her before Lucifer finds her. So far no baby, but he hasn’t found us either. The others act like that’s some sort of victory, but I didn’t get this far resting on my laurels. It’s only a matter of time before he and his Princes make their play. We simply have to keep one step ahead of them if we want to win.</p> <p>Because despite what you might think, the end of the world isn’t a game to me. Not when Merri’s life is on the line.</p> <p><b>For fans of Supernatural and American Horror Story, USA Today bestselling authors Meg Anne and K. Loraine are thrilled to bring you the final installment in the Mate Games Universe.</b></p> <p><b>Warning: The Mate Games: Apocalypse is a spicy paranormal series featuring morally gray heroes whose methods of protection aren't always above board. Not that you can expect much honor from a celibate recluse, an incubus rockstar, the original shadow daddy, and a grumpy ex-Spartan. They are the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, after all.</b></p>";
