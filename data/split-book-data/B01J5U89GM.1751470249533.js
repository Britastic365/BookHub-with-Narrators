window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>His wolf is out of control. She's a wild thing that won't be tamed.</b> </p> <p>Ex-Army Specialist Jace River has a lock on his bedroom door, but it's not to keep anyone out; it's to keep his nightmares from breaking loose. His wolf is an out-of-control killer, which means he can never risk shifting, never truly be part of his pack, and definitely never take a mate. </p> <p>Piper Wilding works for the Army as a civilian, traveling the world for her work in counterintelligence and fighting the bad guys while bedding down the good ones. The best part? It keeps her far from her asshole father in Seattle, the rest of the Wilding pack, and the pressure to take a mate. Settling down isn't her thing, and after what happened to her mother, Piper vowed she would never be tied down by magic or men again. </p> <p>While Jace's wolf keeps him Sleepless in Seattle, Piper returns home to find her missing kid brother. When she breaks into the River brothers' safehouse, sparks fly and claws come out. Her sexy skills threaten to bring out Jace's wolf, and Jace's good-guy hotness reminds Piper how tempting shifter men can be. They're like fire and gasoline, and as they race to find Piper's brother, the heat threatens to burn down all their carefully constructed walls. But falling in love has never been so dangerous - and being together means taking risks that neither might survive. </p> <p>Recommended: Listen to <i>Jaxson</i> (River Pack Wolves, Book 1) first! <i>Jace</i> is a complete novel with HEA, the second in the River Pack Wolves trilogy (all standalone stories, but best enjoyed if you listen to them in order!). </p> <p>Contains scorching hot shifters, alpha military heroes, and sexy spy girls. Only listeners over 18 should dive into the deliciously hot world of the River brothers. </p>";
