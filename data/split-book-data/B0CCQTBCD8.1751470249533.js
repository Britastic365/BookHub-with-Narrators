window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>”Forbidden romance at its sexiest!” - DANIELLE L. JENSEN, author of The Bridge Kingdom</p> <p>It was supposed to be a quick mission. The only thing quick about it was how rapidly I failed. With only a month left to earn her missing feathers, twenty-year-old Leigh embarks on a trip to Paris to meet her newest project, twenty-five-year-old Jarod Adler, leader of the Parisian Mafia and the worst kind of sinner . . . a Triple.</p> <p>If Leigh can get Jarod to accomplish a single act of kindness, she stands to win 100 feathers, more than enough to complete her wings and ascend to Elysium, the land of angels. What she doesn’t count on is Jarod's dark charm costing her feathers. She’s dead set on saving him, and he’s dead set on destroying her. Until he realizes destroying her wings is also destroying her heart. A heart he longs to hear beat only for him.</p> <p>Fans of dark supernatural romance will devour this modern ROMEO &amp; JULIET retelling today.</p> <p>*Warning: FEATHER deals with dark topics, such as suicide, and contains graphic sex.</p>";
