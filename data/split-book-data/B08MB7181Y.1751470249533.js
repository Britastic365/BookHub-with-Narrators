If I were, his accent alone would melt me. Add in the fact that he's a veterinarian, and my animal-loving heart would be flip flopping.</p> <p>But my heart's on the mend. I'm a single parent like him, and raising my teenage daughter is my top priority. Plus, falling for a guy who shares your property line is a line you shouldn’t cross.</p> <p>Still, I'm an outgoing gal, so I do the neighborly thing and offer to be his dating insider.</p> <p>Surely, I can help this small town’s most eligible bachelor ever navigate his way through all the fantastic single ladies eager to make his acquaintance.</p> <p>What could possibly go wrong in helping the dream guy next door find his one true love?</p> <p>So I set him up on one date, two dates, three dates — and I’m about to find out exactly how dangerous my offer is.</p>";
