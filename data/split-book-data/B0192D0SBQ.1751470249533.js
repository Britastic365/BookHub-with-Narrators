window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>She's through playing it safe.... </p> <p><i>Waiting. Watching.</i> </p> <p>Jambrea was patient long enough. After nearly 10 years pining over a man with whom she'd spent a single night, her job set her on a collision course with two sexy cops who turned her head...and ignited her passion. </p> <p><i>More agonizing. Debating.</i> </p> <p>When it became clear that Matt and Clint would never admit to the bisexual attraction making an equilateral relationship possible, she couldn't choose a favorite. So she had to turn away and move her life forward - without them. Jambrea approaches Mistress Lily and Master Jeremy to arrange a wild night at their sex club - never expecting her friends would pull a bait and switch. </p> <p><i>Time's up.</i> </p> <p>Just when happily ever after dangles within reach, it becomes clear someone has Jambrea in their crosshairs. Is it one of her lovers' old cases coming back to haunt them, or a ghost from her military past? One thing's for certain: Now that they've made the leap, they'd better learn to soar...or they'll all crash together. </p> <p>Warning: The men in blue have handcuffs, and they're not afraid to use them - on their woman or each other. Be naughty, if you must. Maybe they'll come for you next! </p>";
