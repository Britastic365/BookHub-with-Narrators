window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Get the first three full-length novels in this digital box set of New York Times bestselling author Joseph Nassise's action-packed Templar Chronicles urban fantasy series, where modern Templar Knights protect mankind from supernatural threats and enemies.<br> <br> THE HERETIC - Knight Commander Cade Williams and the men of the Echo Team are the best the Vatican has to offer when it comes to protecting mankind from supernatural threats and enemies. But when the Templar Order itself comes under attack from a cabal of necromancers intent on seizing an ancient artifact for their own nefarious purposes, will the skills of Echo Team's fearless leader, the man some call the Heretic, be enough to stop the slaughter?<br> <br> A SCREAM OF ANGELS - When injured and badly dehydrated Catholic priest wanders out of the New Mexican desert, telling a wild story about a secret research installation and bloodthirsty demons hunting men through the halls, it is the men of the Echo Team who are called into investigate. Their mission - infiltrate the facility, determine exactly what happened there, and deal with any infernal presence that might exist.<br> <br> A TEAR IN THE SKY - When Knight Commander Cade Williams discovers that his wife, Gabrielle, is not truly dead, but held in some kind of arcane stasis between the lands of the living and the lands of the dead, he vows that nothing will stop him from freeing her soul from the prison surrounding her. But his vow is tested right from the start when an old friend calls on him to help protect the city of Boston from the ancient scourge that threatens to destroy it, leaving Cade with a heart-breaking choice: Do his duty and save the innocent lives he has sworn to protect or forsake them all in order to rescue the one for whom he would brave the walls of hell itself?</p>";
