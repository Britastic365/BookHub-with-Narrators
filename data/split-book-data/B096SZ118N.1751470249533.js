window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>A British werewolf in the Wild West and a modern American girl collide in this steamy time travel romance.</i></b><br> <br> I crave adventure and a real man, the kind who sweeps a woman off her feet and steals her breath away. But all I get in grad school is losers who don't even know how to kiss. My friends talk me into a day trip to an Old West ghost town for \"fun.\" It's a truly lame excursion—until I'm catapulted back in time and straight into the arms of Sheriff Nathaniel Fortescue, the hottest British cowboy ever.<br> <br> Kylie Drummond is not like any woman in the Devil's Outlands. She speaks strangely and dresses strangely, but unlike anyone else in this town, she does not fear me. That's her first mistake. I've been cursed to walk the night as a wolf ravening for blood, though Kylie will never know that. To protect her from me and from the Outlands’ worst elements, I must find a way to send her home—wherever or whenever that may be.<br> <br> Nathaniel thinks I can't figure out his secret, but I've read enough novels about werewolves to get the picture. The attraction between us is red-hot and dangerous. Am I destined to save him? Or to destroy us both? When Nathaniel’s past sins threaten to unleash unspeakable evil, it’s not a matter of where we can hide. It’s a matter of when.<br> <br> <b><i>The Outlands Shifter</i></b><b> is the first book in the Devil's Outlands series of steamy paranormal romance.</b></p>";
