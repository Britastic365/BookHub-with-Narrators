window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The only thing worse than falling for a tortured, broody vampire who has sworn off love and happiness? Learning vampires can make babies, after all….</p> <p>After he took my ancient virginity, Baron Blackmore insisted he'd made a terrible mistake. He told me to stay as far away from him as I could get.</p> <p>He practically gave me a “get knocked up with my baby and keep it a secret for as long as you want” free card. But I’ll tell him the truth eventually. Once I convince him he isn’t the monster he thinks he is. He’s a fierce, passionate, protective man who deserves the love and happiness he’s pushed away for so long.</p> <p>And he deserves it with me and our daughter, no matter how many obstacles stand in our way.</p>";
