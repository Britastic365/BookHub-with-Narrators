After walking in on a masked man murdering my neighbor, I went back to the one place I swore I'd never step foot in again. Citrus Cove.</p> <p>The sleepy town hasn't changed much, but the people have. Including my old high school bully, Cameron Harlow.</p> <p>He's the last person I want to see. He should be the last person I want.</p> <p>But Cameron Harlow has been dreaming of the day he'd see me again, and wants to set things right.

They want me dead.</p> <p>From the ashes of our broken beginnings, all we want is our happy ending.
