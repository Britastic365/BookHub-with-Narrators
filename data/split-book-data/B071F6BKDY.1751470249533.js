What they discover there may very well change the balance of power in their favor against the Thule Empire. </p> <p>But their discovery will count for nothing if they cannot reach Lamuria in time to try and stop the massive invasion force sent by Lord Zelroth, who is intent on destroying their capital and stealing the High Temple's secrets for himself. Lusam inadvertently discovers a long guarded secret of Lord Zelroth's, one that will profoundly change his own life forever and force him to take action that he may very well not be prepared for. </p>";
