This box set contains all four books in the Lochlann Treaty series, and </b><b><i>never before seen</i></b><b> exclusive bonus content. </b> </p> <p><b>Peace at any cost.</b></p> <p>Princess Charlotte’s entire life had been planned. </p> <p>Right up until the moment her fiancé is kidnapped on her wedding day, sending the entire kingdom hurtling toward disaster. </p> <p>Charlie has never left the protective grounds of the castle, but to save her intended, she’ll trade her crown for a sword and forge into dangerous rebel lands alongside her fiancé’s arrogant older brother, Logan. </p> <p>Logan thinks she’s a spoiled princess. She’s about to prove him wrong. </p> <p>But each step deeper into the enemy’s world confirms nothing is what it seems. Not the love that was supposed to be easy.
