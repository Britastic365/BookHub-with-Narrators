But a certain bullheaded Deadwood detective has a problem - his informant from Slagton has gone missing. When Violet is shanghaied into taking a hunting trip to the ghost town to search for the missing snitch, she stumbles into trouble that will take more than a double-barreled shotgun to escape. </p> <p>Will Violet survive this new hell that haunts her, or will she end up on Slagton's growing list of those \"gutted and hung\"?</p>";
