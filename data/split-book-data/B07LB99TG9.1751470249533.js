window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>They’re the last five dragons in existence. To survive, they must form soul-bonds with five humans who are pure of heart and resolute of spirit. Too bad they’re stuck with us instead: the angry drunk; the shameless man-whore; the coward who ran away and got his comrades killed; the ice-cold assassin for hire; and me, the girl with abandonment issues as deep and wide as the Southern Sea.</p> <p>I left home in search of adventure. Instead, I stumbled into the middle of a desperate struggle for survival.</p> <p>Five people. Five mythical beasts.</p> <p>If we manage to get through this mess, it’s going to be a miracle.</p> <p><i>The Dragon Mistress: Book 1</i> by <i>USA Today</i> best-selling author R. A. Steffan is a medium-burn fantasy romance series where the heroine doesn’t have to choose one person at the end. It is part of the Eburosi Chronicles, along with <i>The Horse Mistress</i> and <i>The Lion Mistress</i>. It’s not necessary to have heard any of the other books in the series before starting <i>The Dragon Mistress</i>.</p> <p>A special note for fantasy fans: Herein, you will find explicit love scenes in several interesting and unconventional permutations. If your gut reaction to that is “eww” or even “meh”, you probably won't enjoy this series. Also, be aware that <i>The Dragon Mistress: Book 1</i> is the first installment of a series arc. It is not intended as a stand-alone book.</p>";
