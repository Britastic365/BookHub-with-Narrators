window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>As the fixer for Blackbridge Security, Quinten Lake is the man that comes in and cleans up after people make stupid decisions. Which means he didn’t want to be the one teaching lustful women gun safety. There were guys on the team better suited for the task.</p> <p>Get in and get out, that’s his motto, something he lives by not only at work, but also in his personal life. And he could be doing just that if it weren’t for the internet. </p> <p>But if #BlackbridgeSpecial wasn’t trending online he would’ve never met Hayden Prescott. He wouldn’t be wondering why she won’t make eye contact with him. He’s supposed to teach her the skills to protect herself, but his ego is encouraging him to be her means of protection. She isn’t impressed, and he’s left wondering if she’ll ever open her eyes and finally see him.</p>";
