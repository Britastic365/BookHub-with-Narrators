window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>There’s a smokin’ hot dead guy locked in my garden shed. That part’s bad enough. But now, he’s trying to get out.</b></p> <p>Growing up, my father always told me that I’d come to a bad end, just like my mom did when I was a kid. Hearing that kind of stuff when you’re little eventually gets to a girl, but I can’t say I ever expected my \"bad end\" to involve an angry vampire with a severe case of iron deficiency and a panty-melting English accent.</p> <p>Maybe I shouldn’t be surprised. Ever since my mother was assassinated, I’ve felt like there was something vast and frightening hidden beneath the fabric of the world - something none of us are supposed to know about.</p> <p>So far, finding out I was right hasn’t been nearly as satisfying as I’d hoped. I guess the trick will be staying alive long enough to shout, \"I told you so\" from the rooftops.</p> <p>But before I can do that, I really need to figure out if the vampire who just bit me is one of the good guys or not.</p> <p><i>The Last Vampire</i> is a steamy, new urban fantasy romance series from <i>USA Today</i> best-selling author R. A. Steffan and Jaelynn Woolf, co-authors of the <i>Circle of Blood</i> saga. </p> <p>Download book one today, and enter a world shared by humans, fae, demons, and one very reluctant vampire. It’s a place where the supernatural threatens the mundane, nothing is as it seems, and love will either be the world’s downfall - or its salvation.</p>";
