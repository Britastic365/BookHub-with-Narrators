window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>All is not as it seems as a daring undercover agent and an unconventional Southern belle mix business with pleasure in this classic story of romance and suspense from <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Kay Hooper. </p> <p>Kelsey has come to the idyllic southern town of Pinnacle to investigate a shady company called Meditron, which has a ruthless way of getting what it wants - or so claims the desperate caller who contacts the FBI. The locals won't talk about Meditron. But Kelsey is an expert interrogator, prepared to use his seductive charms to his every advantage. He just hadn't counted on falling for the beautiful witness at the center of his investigation. </p> <p>Elizabeth Conner is too proud to ask for any sort of assistance. She never needed help raising her three willful younger sisters. But now her family is in serious trouble, and Elizabeth's stubborn independence is a deadly liability. And then Kelsey sweeps her up - and into his arms - like a force of nature, promising to protect Elizabeth and her sisters from a relentless enemy. Elizabeth never imagined letting any man get too close, let alone one who can't even disclose his full name. But daring to trust this tempting stranger is a danger she must embrace.</p>";
