I don't want to play homemaker and submit to a bunch of Alphas. So when I take Calling Wood by storm, I'm quick to show that the typical Alpha packs just won't do.</p> <p>I'm determined to find my scent match. And refuse to take a pack unless it's who I'm meant to be with. Call me stubborn, but I know what I want.</p> <p>After meeting almost every unclaimed pack in the school, I start to lose hope. That is, until I catch the scent of something that has me weak in the knees.</p> <p>Tristan, Finn, Sawyer, and Dominic are not like other Alphas. They've given up hope on finding their Omega, making school their whole lives. They don't think they are good enough, worthy enough, to have their happily ever after.</p> <p>But these sweet nerdy inexperienced boys aren't going to know what hit them. I love a challenge and Iâ€™ve made it my mission to prove they are worthy. That we are worthy.<br> <br> <i>We Are Worthy</i> is a non-shifter sweet standalone with lots of steamy moments. It will end on a HEA.</p>";
