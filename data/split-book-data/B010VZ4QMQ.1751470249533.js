window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Where do you go when you can't run away? Lara doesn't trust herself and Morgan can't remember when he trusted anyone. They were sailing smoothly toward each other on a sweet voyage of discovery. Then Morgan got knocked back by a wave of panic from his past that he never got to explain. </p> <p>A freak encounter with a thousand pound fish leaves Morgan delirious and Lara even more confused. The demons that swirl around his fevered head hint at a hell Lara is afraid to understand. Stuck on a boat with a wounded man she no longer thinks she knows, Lara's convinced she's added another sad page to her book of mistakes. </p> <p>Sometimes bodies heal much faster than hearts. Morgan's unsettled business with his father pushes him in reckless directions and he sweeps Lara along with him. <i>Wrecked</i> is a story of loss and love among the ruins life can be. </p> <p>This is a full length novel. It is meant to be listened to following <i>Hooked</i> (Part 1) and before <i>Rescued</i> (Part 3). This is the second audiobook in the Wet serial trilogy. It is an erotic romance told from alternating points of view. Explicit scenes are intended only for adults who enjoy that sort of thing. </p>";
