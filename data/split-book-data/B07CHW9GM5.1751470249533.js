window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The final book in the Dark Fae FBI series.</b></p> <p>The Fae war is coming, and I'm caught right in the middle. My father, the ruthless Unseelie king, is dead. It should have been our moment of triumph. Instead, we find ourselves hiding in London from our ancient enemies, the Seelie. From Roan’s city mansion, we need to unite the six Unseelie courts to fight back. Unfortunately, centuries-old feuds make this almost impossible.</p> <p>To make things worse, there’s no good reason for anyone to listen to us. After all, I’m just a pixie bastard. Did I mention that my dread powers are gone? If that weren’t enough, I need to decide if I want to live forever in the world of the humans, or the world of the fae with Roan. Sure - he’s gorgeous and loyal, but do I want to spend forever in this chaos?</p> <p>As the Seelie encroach on our territory, it’s time to see if Roan and I - terror and love - can really change the world together.</p>";
