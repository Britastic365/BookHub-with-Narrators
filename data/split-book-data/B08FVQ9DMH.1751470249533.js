window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>He tried to romance her, but now it is time for his mate to be claimed.</b></p> <p>When Catherine Livingston travels to Italy to investigate her sister's disappearance, it isn't long before she crosses paths with the man who has been ravishing her almost every night in her dreams. More shocking still, the mysterious, darkly handsome stranger leaves her in no doubt that he is well aware of the connection between them and he has no intention of ignoring it.</p> <p>Marco DeMedici seems to all but own the city of Florence, and it soon becomes clear that he will not rest until Catherine belongs to him, even if it means carrying her off, stripping her bare, and spanking her until she is sobbing, obedient, and begging him to take her hard and thoroughly.</p> <p>Despite Catherine's efforts to run from him, her body's response to Marco's stern dominance cannot be denied, and when he reveals that he is an alpha shifter it only makes it more obvious that her world will never be the same. She will be his mate, and the only thing left up to her will be how loudly she screams his name as he claims her as roughly and shamefully as he pleases.</p> <p><b>Publisher's Note: </b><b><i>Claimed and Mated</i></b><b> is a stand-alone novel which is the fifth entry in the </b><b><i>Wayward Mates</i></b><b> series.
