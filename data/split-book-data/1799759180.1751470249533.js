window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An unforgettable and breathtaking novel of love, loss, and the unexpected routes that life takes from Amazon Charts and </b><b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><b> bestselling author Kerry Lonsdale.</b></p> <p>With her deceased sister’s Route 66 bucket list in hand, California girl Joy Evers sets out on a cross-country road trip to meet up with her fiancé, checking off the bullets along the way.</p> <p>Singer-songwriter Dylan Westfield has a serious case of wanderlust and a broken-down car. Stuck at a diner between LA and Flagstaff, he meets Joy, his complete opposite. She’s energetic. He’s moody. She’s by the book. He’s spontaneous. She believes in love at first sight. He thinks love is a complicated mess. But Joy has a brand-new convertible.</p> <p>They strike a deal. She’ll drive him to New York. He’ll pay for gas. Only three rules apply: no exchanging of last names; what happens on the road, stays on the road; and if one of them wants to take a side trip, they both must agree.</p> <p>A heart-stirring love story that spans a decade, <i>Side Trip</i> explores <i>what-if</i>. What if Joy and Dylan had exchanged last names? What if he’d told her she made him believe love was worth the risk? And what if they hadn’t made that second deal when they couldn’t say goodbye?</p>";
