With a life-threatening winter storm approaching, it’s no surprise Max is concerned for the residents of his beloved small town. But it’s his new neighbor that really has him worried. With the power out and temperatures plummeting, Max does what any good neighbor would do. He offers her a place to stay. </p> <p>Finding a decent man is hard enough. But for Eleanor Page it’s even harder. Because she’s is a self-made billionaire. And that seems to be difficult for the men she meets to handle. So when her rugged, handsome neighbor shows up on her doorstep during a massive storm, Eleanor is a bit shell-shocked. While she initially rejects his offer, it isn’t long before she has no other option. </p> <p>As the snow piles up outside and Max turns on the charm, Eleanor struggles to share the truth about who she is. But when tragedy strikes and Eleanor tips the scales, she wonders if she’s lost her chance at love.</p>";
