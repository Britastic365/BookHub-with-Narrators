And had no clue I existed. </b></p> <p>Luca Fritz was the worst sort of playboy, constantly falling in and out of love with every woman he met. I used to spend hours of my life staring at the huge Fritz mansion from the window of the staff house, dreaming of him. By 18 I’d all but given up my fantasy, set to go off to The Conservatory in London to follow my dreams when fate stepped in with other ideas.</p> <p>That summer I was young. Innocent. And forbidden to him.</p> <p>I knew when we succumbed to the explosive passion between us that he would inevitably ruin me.</p> <p>I wasn’t wrong.</p> <p>Four years later, fate decides to step in again. I’m offered my dream job as a first-chair cellist for the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Only I know what comes with it.</p> <p>Luca Fritz.</p> <p>On opening night, he comes barreling back into my life. Desperate for a shot at his second chance. A second chance I have no intention of giving. Now a brilliant neurosurgeon, he thinks he knows exactly the right way to crawl back not only into my bed but into my heart.</p> <p>I don’t care how persistent, unexpected, or clever he is. I am not that lovesick teenage girl anymore. It’ll take a hell of a lot more than panty-melting smiles and heart-stopping encounters to win me back over.</p> <p>This cocky playboy is about to learn that all’s fair in love and war.
