After the chaos, I’m whisked away to my new home.</p> <p>Home to Elementra. To them.</p> <p>The Vito Nexus.</p> <p>When secrets are revealed, what does it mean for us?</p> <p>Only Elementra knows, and she only tells me when she sees fit.</p> <p>Jump into the realm of Elementra where you'll find, magic, shifters, possessive/overly protective men, bonds, secrets, and so much more! Gift from the Tree is a full-length slow-mid burn Romantasy novel and book 1 of 5 in the series, so expect a cliffhanger. It may have triggers for some as it has intense, dark scenes/flashbacks of abuse to our FMC (not from our MMC’s), violence, delicious angst, steamy situations, and gritty language. Please review content warning in the book. Intended for ages 18+.</p>";
