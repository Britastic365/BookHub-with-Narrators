window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Evie St. Claire's life takes an exciting turn when she discovers she's the rightful heir to her long-lost aunt's estate. Filled with anticipation, she quickly learns that her inheritance is a dilapidated house of little value. To make matters worse, claiming her great aunt's remains requires a journey to the serene lakeside town of Honeysuckle Springs.</p> <p>Once in the picturesque town, Evie's hopes are shattered as she encounters a murder victim shortly after her arrival. Bewildered and caught off guard, she finds herself embroiled in a web of suspicion, with even the attractive police chief keeping a watchful eye on her. As whispers of a past visit circulate among the town's residents, Evie's bewilderment grows, further fueling the suspicions surrounding her involvement in the murder investigation.</p> <p>However, the greatest surprise lies in store when Evie's mischievous inherited cat reveals astonishing news that forever alters her life. Little by little, the town's and her family's shocking secrets are revealed. The burning question remains: will these revelations lead her closer to the elusive killer? Moreover, will they persuade Evie to embrace her newfound connection to Honeysuckle Springs, or drive her back to the comfort of her familiar, predictable existence, pretending that none of the extraordinary events ever occurred?</p>";
