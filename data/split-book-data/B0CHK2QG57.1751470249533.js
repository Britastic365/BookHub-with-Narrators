window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From #1 </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>USA Today</i></b><b> bestselling author Rachel Van Dyken comes a new story in The Dark Ones Saga…</b></p> <p>I see everything. I feel everything.<br> I watch people fall in love. I watch them burn with hate, anger, rage, and I see the cycle repeat over and over again. I take it on every night I work at Timber, aka Anubis’s bar in downtown Seattle, and then I help the rest of the immortals keep the very intense balance between Heaven and Earth.</p> <p>I see everyone's future but mine, and when I try to look, all I see is darkness, despair, need…</p> <p>Until she walks into my bar with bruises on her face, getting pulled by one of the lesser demons. I do what any good bartender would do… I beat him within an inch of his life and turn my eyes to her.<br> By then, it’s too late.<br> She already has me in her grasp.<br> A succubus that has no other plan than to suck me clean of every inch of power that’s been bestowed on me by the Heavens.</p> <p>I never thought my future involved getting kidnapped and tied up or that I’d die by way of sex—then again, maybe that’s for the best. Dying at the hands of my enemy rather than being one more burden to my already mated friends.</p> <p>After all, giving into one last need before death, while selfish, may be exactly what my darkness means.</p> <p>My need is great.<br> And she’s about to find out just how much.</p> <p><i>**Every 1001 Dark Nights novella is a standalone story. For new readers, it’s an introduction to an author’s world. And for fans, it’s a bonus book in the author’s series. We hope you'll enjoy each one as much as we do.**</i></p>";
