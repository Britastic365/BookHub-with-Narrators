Includes three previously published titles in one handy collection for your listening and giggling pleasure.</p> <ul> <li><i>Jane Davey’s Locket</i>: Jane’s being dragged on a cruise by her grandma, who also thought it was a good idea to cast a love spell on her locket. Maybe that explains why she finds herself falling for a lion shifter.</li> <li><i>Bride of the Sea Monster</i>: Watch out for those umbrella drinks. Not even one day at sea, and Sasha ends up accidentally married to a sea monster.</li> <li><i>Old Demon and the Sea Witch</i>: A long time ago, Shax loved a sea witch, but was too dumb to admit it. It’s time for a second chance. A cruise through the tropics seems like the perfect place to rekindle things.</li> </ul> <p>Part of the Welcome to Hell series.</p>";
