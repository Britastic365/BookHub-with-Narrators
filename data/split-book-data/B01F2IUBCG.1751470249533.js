Gabe is committed to upholding the law and cares deeply for the residents he's sworn to protect. He, too, would like to find a lifetime companion, a marriage like his parents have. </p> <p>When Evie arrives in Carin, Illinois, it's to help launch a new task force dedicated to reexamining unsolved crimes across the state. Spearheading this trial run, Evie will work with the sheriff's department on a couple of its most troubling missing-person cases. As she reexamines old evidence to pull out a few tenuous new leads, she unearths a surprising connection...possibly to a third cold case. </p> <p>Evie's determined to solve the cases before she leaves Carin County, and Sheriff Thane, along with his family, will be key to those answers. </p>";
