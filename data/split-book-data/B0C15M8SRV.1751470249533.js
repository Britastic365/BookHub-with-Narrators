window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Jessica Martin is not a nice girl.</b></p> <p>As prom queen and captain of the cheer squad, she'd ruled her school mercilessly, looking down her nose at everyone she deemed unworthy. The most unworthy of them all? The \"freak,\" Manson Reed: her favorite victim.</p> <p>But a lot changes after high school.</p> <p>A freak like him never should have ended up at the same Halloween party as her. He never should have been able to beat her at a game of Drink or Dare. He never should have been able to humiliate her in front of everyone.</p> <p>Losing the game means taking the dare: a dare to serve Manson for the entire night as his slave. It's a dare that Jessica's pride—and curiosity—won't allow her to refuse. What ensues is a dark game of pleasure and pain, fear and desire.</p> <p>Is it only a game? Only revenge? Only a dare?</p> <p>Or is it something more?</p> <p><i>The Dare</i> contains mature content. The activities depicted in this book are not meant to be realistic depictions of BDSM or safe kink play; this is strictly a work of fiction.</p>";
