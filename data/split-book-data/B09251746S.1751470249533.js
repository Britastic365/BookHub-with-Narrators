I asked him several times about his crazy zombie-killing horse. He omitted to tell me he was the Horseman of Death until Leif let it slip he was the Horseman of Pestilence when he introduced himself to me. I don’t know who I’m madder at—Aeron for lying to me or me for just ignoring all the clues and telling myself there was no way it was possible and trusting him.</p> <p>I’m trapped in a militarized city in Mexico with two of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. They say they are my friends, but are they really? Does Aeron actually care about me, or was that some big ruse to get me here so Leif could take my blood?</p> <p>Aeron is apologetic, but Leif seems to want to talk. Maybe he’ll actually tell me the truth about how my blood caused the apocalypse.</p> <p><b><i>The Black Rider</i></b><i> is the second book of End of Days, a post-apocalyptic slow-burn reverse-harem romance. The harem will slowly grow as the books progress. The harem features the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.</i></p>";
