So in a way, moving 2,000 miles away from everything she's ever known makes perfect sense.</p> <p>Creel Creek, Virginia, is the last place either of her ex-husbands would ever think to look for her. What better place to hide from her humiliations than a town too small to warrant a mention on a map?</p> <p>Laid off, and recently divorced from husband number two, this former workaholic moves in with her estranged - and very strange - grandmother. A grandmother who informs Constance that she comes from a long line of powerful witches. And on the day she hits the big 4-0, she'll come into her powers.</p> <p>It turns out that she's not the only paranormal person in town. Under the sleepy surface, the small town is teeming with supernatural beings.</p> <p>When Constance finds the town's resident vampire dead, things go from surreal to scary. The local sheriff is convinced that a killer is lurking in the shadows, hunting anyone with supernatural abilities...including witches like her.</p> <p>He's not wrong.</p> <p>Can Constance learn enough magic to save herself and Creel Creek from this unknown foe?</p>";
