A couple's quest for ever-safer sex leads to a near-fatal love triangle. </p><p>In DailyLit's first short story bundle, six very different writers explore the ways our digital obsessions have (and haven't) transformed the way we love. Award-winning and best-selling novelists Adam Haslett, Tova Mirvis, and Deni Bechard are paired here with exciting new voices Vanessa Hua, Justin Keenan, and Namwali Serpell for a listening experience that moves between domestic tragedy and weird, sexy sci-fi, international revenge plots and fantasies not even big enough for two. </p>";
