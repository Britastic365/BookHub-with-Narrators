Neither one believes in fairy tales.</b></p> <p>City waitress Lara has the voice of an angel and no idea she's marked as the fated mate of a silver-eyed royal from another realm. When she falls into Faery and meets an obnoxious huntsman who mistakes her for a troll, she's amazed to discover he's the cursed Prince of Air in disguise. Ever's mother, the queen, is less than impressed. The opposing court of techno-loving Unseelie wants her as their very own pet. And an evil air mage wishes her dead.</p> <p>Held captive by Elemental fae in the Land of Five, she's certainly hit rock bottom. But songs wield power, and Lara happens to be a true diva. Now if only she can use her newfound magical skill to make the Prince of Never a little less attractive. The first thing she wants is to find a way back home, and the last is to fall in love.</p> <p>Ever and Lara think they know what they want, but destiny and an age-old curse have other ideas.</p>";
