To find adventure and maybe even a little bit of romance. What she didn't expect was to get swept up by the charming sea captain with a gleam in his eye. A gleam that told her he wanted to do wicked things to her and lord help her she might just let him. </p> <p>James wasn't looking for adventure, he'd had his share in the navy. After a dishonorable discharge for a crime he didn't commit, he was friendless, jobless, and on the run. His only solitude was the Never Isles where nobody knew his name. Until she literally fell into his arms. Can he find solace in her carefree heart before his past crimes catch up with him? </p>";
