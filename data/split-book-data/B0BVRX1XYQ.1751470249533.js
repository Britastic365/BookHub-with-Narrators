window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Bold. Beautiful. Beguiling.</b></p> <p>It’s been over a year since Emma Clark’s no-good husband left on an expedition. The Countess of Dearborn has played the abandoned wife, but people are beginning to presume the earl is dead, which doesn't suit Emma at all. Emma likes being head of household in Albert’s absence and does her best to keep his family believing he is alive and well. She’s thirty years old and finally having some fun. If the earl is in fact dead, his family is waiting in the wings to swoop in and throw Emma out, leaving her destitute.</p> <p>Then along comes Luka Olivien, the Weslorian Earl of Marlaine. He’s traveled all the way from Egypt, duty bound to return to the countess her deceased husband’s precious pocket watch—only to discover she doesn’t know he’s dead… Or does she? It’s hard to tell. Luka catches glimpses of the desperate vulnerability beneath the party girl exterior and can’t help being drawn into the beguiling countess’s ruse.</p> <p><b>A Royal Match</b></p> <p><b>Book 1: </b><b><i>Last Duke Standing</i></b></p> <p><b>Book 2: </b><b><i>The Duke Not Taken</i></b></p> <p><b>Book 3: </b><b><i>The Viscount Who Vexed Me</i></b></p>";
