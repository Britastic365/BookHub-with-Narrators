window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The Syndicate Masters were assigned as Guardians by the goddess over six centuries ago. Each generation brings new and different challenges. These ruthless and wild dons are the protectors, the Guardians of their territories.</p> <p>On the Eastern Seaboard, the Masters control horse racing, casinos, and gambling, among other things. Get ready for over-the-top, possessive mob bosses who will do what is needed to find and protect their fated mates.</p> <p><b><i>High Stakes</i></b><br> A Mafia don who's not afraid to get his hands dirty to find the truth, and a reporter that can't resist his dark charms.</p> <p>Killian O’ Neill controls the pulse of the vibrant horse racing world in the Finger Lakes region of New York. He also has ties to a powerful syndicate in Ireland. Carlyn Murphy is the investigative reporter who took comfort in his arms for one night and then walked away.</p> <p>Now, when she is on the trail of a story that could rock the thoroughbred racing industry and has far larger complications, a lone shot rings out, changing everything.</p> <p>Can he save his mate and find the killer before the next attempt?</p> <p><b><i>High Roller</i></b><br> Axel gave Victoria an impossible choice, and she chose him.</p> <p>Axel</p> <p>I’m in negotiation with the Albanian mob. They think I’m going to stand with them against the others. They’re wrong. Atlantic City is my town...or at least it’s going to be. And then I see her across a crowded bar at one of the city’s best casinos.</p> <p>Victoria</p> <p>My brother is dead. He’s been dead for five years and no one seems inclined to bring those who killed him to justice. Well, no one except me.<br> <br> When Axel saves me from a drunk at the Blue Eye, I let myself have a wonderful weekend of indulgence and pleasure. When Axel wants me for arm candy at a high-stakes poker game, I figure, why not?<br> <br> Only that poker game is about far more than I knew and now I’m caught up in it with no way out.</p> <p><b><i>High Bet</i></b><br> At night, he invades my dreams...during the day, I can’t forget the way he made me feel during those dreams.</p> <p>Lauren<br> I'm the leader of a rogue band of vixens, who left our origin skulk to live our dream—owning a catering company. The problem is our dream costs money, and we don’t have any. The solution is doing what foxes do best...steal. Now I’m in way over my head. The only thing standing between us and real danger is Jace Evans.</p> <p>Jace<br> I am the leader of the Calos Syndicate and the Florida Panther clan. I deal in gambling, arms dealing, smuggling, and a lot of legitimate businesses that aren’t nearly as much fun as the illegal ones. In the next few weeks, I’m opening a luxury casino featuring a roulette wheel that once belonged to the Marquis de Sade. Bonding dreams with my fated mate has been an unexpected delight and has revealed the truth of who she is. Sounds easy, right? Wrong! She is neither panther nor human; she’s a sexy fox-shifter with a nasty temper and a rebellious streak a mile wide. Turning her is forbidden and she’s determined to fight me. But what do I care? I love a challenge, and if it’s illegal, so much the better.</p> <p>In the end, I'll win everything. She’ll come to me, and when she does, I’ll make all her deepest, darkest dreams come true.</p>";
