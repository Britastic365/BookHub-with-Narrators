window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>My alphas have crowns…and if I can win the rite, so will I.</b></p> <p>After arriving in Fall Mountain Pack, I found out all the secrets the alphas were forced to keep from me—and the terrible truths that came with them...along with what loving them will cost me. The rite is a thousand-year-old test for the position of alpha female, and if I want to win it, I have to battle against wolves far stronger and more trained than I am.</p> <p><i>The six instructions for the Forest Rite:</i></p> <p><i>1. Once you enter, you can’t shift.</i></p> <p><i>2. You can’t leave unless you win, not even in death.</i></p> <p><i>3. Don’t look into the shadows.</i></p> <p><i>4. If a path appears, take it at your own risk.</i></p> <p><i>5. This is the forest of the gods. Pray to them for help.</i></p> <p><i>6. Only one wolf leaves.</i></p> <p>The alphas can’t save me now, and we aren’t alone in the city. The old gods are stirring, pulling themselves back into a world on the brink of war. The angels are silent, including their king, which is strange. Persephone and Hades’s love may have been written in the stars, but if I want my alphas, I have to fight. And I will.</p> <p>This is a full-length reverse harem romance novel full of sexy alpha males, steamy scenes, a strong heroine and a lot of sarcasm. Intended for mature listeners.</p>";
