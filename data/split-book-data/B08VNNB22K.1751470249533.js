window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Tired of the hero's journey? Frustrated that funny, romantic, and comforting stories aren't taken seriously? Sad that the books and movies you love never seem to be critically acclaimed, even when they sell like crazy? </p> <p><b>The heroine's journey is here to help. </b></p> <p>Multiple <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Gail Carriger presents a clear, concise analysis of the heroine's journey, how it differs from the hero's journey, and how you can use it to improve your writing and your life. Narrated by Starla Huchton. </p> <p>In this book you'll learn: <br> </p> <p></p> <ul> <li>How to spot the heroine's journey in popular books, movies, and the world around you. </li> <li>The source myths and basic characters, tropes, and archetypes of this narrative. </li> <li>A step-by-step break down of how to successfully write this journey. </li> </ul> <p>What do Agatha Christie, JK Rowling, and Nora Roberts all have in common? They all write the heroine's journey. Read this book to learn all about it. </p> <p><b>From </b><b><i>Harry Potter</i></b><b> to </b><b><i>Twilight</i></b><b>, from </b><b><i>Wonder Woman</i></b><b> to </b><b><i>Star Wars</i></b><b>, you'll never look at pop culture the same way again. </b></p> <p>With over a dozen <i>New York Times </i>and <i>USA Today</i> bestsellers, and over a million books in print, popular genre author and former archaeologist Gail Carriger brings her cheeky, comedic tone and over a decade of making her living as a fiction author to this fascinating look at one of the most popular yet neglected narratives of our time. </p> <p>This is an excellent writing reference for genre fiction authors seeking to improve their craft or for readers and pop culture enthusiasts interested in understanding their own taste. It is the perfect counterpoint to <i>The Hero with a Thousand Faces</i>, not to mention<i> Save the Cat</i>,<i> Women Who Run with the Wolves</i>, and <i>The Breakout Novelist</i>.</p>";
