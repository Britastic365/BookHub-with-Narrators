window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When the ghost of a notorious killer possesses the body of an upper class youth, London’s pre-eminent medium, Emily Chambers, must exorcise it before the spirit goes on a rampage. As if this isn’t distracting enough, she must fight her feelings for brooding ghost, Jacob Beaufort, who doesn’t like the new man in her life–the handsome (and very much alive) Theodore Hyde.</p> <p>With reputations and lives at stake, Emily discovers that navigating the poorest suburbs of London in search of the evil spirit is almost as dangerous as finding her way in a society that thinks “freaks” like her belong in the circus.</p>";
