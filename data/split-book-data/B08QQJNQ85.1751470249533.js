But I didn’t see this coming.</p> <p>My Alpha will stop at nothing to possess me until he drags me all the way to Fortune Fae Academy to join the other wide-eyed Omegas-in-training. He believes I’m strong enough to survive — and I hope he’s right.</p> <p>He also believes I’ll kneel at his feet.</p> <p><i>He couldn’t be more wrong about that.</i></p> <p>I don’t need three broody Betas and an asshat Alpha telling me what to do. I’m going to keep running until he realizes he’s chasing the wrong girl.</p> <p>Except there’s one slight problem. My Alpha has seen the future, too…and he knows something I don’t.</p> <p>Whatever he thinks is going to happen, his cruel smirk says I’m not going anywhere.</p> <p><i>Fortune Fae Academy is Book 1 in a Reverse Harem Omegaverse Romance. Be warned there are obsessive males who will stop at nothing to claim their fated mate. Trigger warnings include dub-con, strong language, and violence. As this is a series, book 1 ends on a cliffhanger.</i></p>";
