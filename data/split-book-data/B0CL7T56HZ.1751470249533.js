However, Sapphire is a strong and fiercely independent woman who won’t be told what to do.</p> <p>When he and his brothers finally find Sadie, what they discover sends shockwaves through the Blue Avengers MC and triggers painful memories from the past.<br> <br> As if that weren’t enough, a clash between the Demons and Sapphire puts her at risk, ultimately forcing her to leave her job.<br> <br> In the end, Rez may get what he wants, but not without paying a price for it first.</p> <p><i>Note: Beyond the Badge: Rez is the fourth book in the Blue Avengers MC series. It’s HIGHLY recommended to listen to this six-book action/adventure series in order, due to the continuing story arcs (subplots). However, each book focuses on a different couple, who gets their HEA. This series has no cheating or relationship cliffhangers.</i></p>";
