window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Ryan needs a nanny for his daughter, and I need a job.</b></p> <p>So I do my best to convince him I'm exactly what he's looking for. It's a win-win.</p> <p>The only problem? I may have a tiny crush on the hottie single dad. Not that he would ever see me like that—he's grumpy, and well…I'm not.</p> <p>We're complete opposites in every way. Not to mention that he only smiles for his daughter, leaving me on the receiving end of his sighs.</p> <p>Little by little, he starts to let his guard down, though. Turns out, the grump has a heart of gold. But falling for him might just break mine.</p> <p>The Single Dad <i>is a rom-com with crackling chemistry, laughs, and heart. It's the second book in the It's Amor series, but it can be enjoyed as a standalone.</i></p>";
