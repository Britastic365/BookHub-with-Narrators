window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I never wanted a mate. Until I was put in chains. Strapped down. And claimed.</p> <p>I always believed I could analyze any situation until I found a solution. Solve any problem if I just applied my brain. </p> <p>I went to university, studied science and told myself my academic cocoon would protect me from the alphas dominating our society.</p> <p>I was wrong. </p> <p>No textbook prepared me for my meeting with test subject 351. The biggest, scariest alpha on death row, hauled into my lab to uncover how to control the beast of a man. How to make him submit. Mold him into a weapon. </p> <p>But there is no controlling the feral alpha, and no logic strong enough to save my mind once he unleashes his fury on my body. </p> <p>Once he claims me. </p> <p><b><i>Feral</i></b><b> is the second book in Nora Ash’s suspense-filled Omegaverse series, </b><b><i>Alpha Ties.</i></b><b> Each book is a full-length novel with a complete romance storyline. This series gets dark, and it gets </b><b><i>dirty.</i></b><b> If you don’t enjoy your romance scorching and your alphas rough and dominant, give this book a pass.</b> </p> <p><b>Please note: This book is the compiled version of Nora's previously published Omegaverse serial, Feral. It contains the installments </b><b><i>Feral: Obsession</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>Feral: Despair</i></b><b>, and</b><b><i> Feral: Torment</i></b><b>.</b></p>";
