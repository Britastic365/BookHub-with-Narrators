window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>He’ll risk it all to protect her.</p> <p>Someone is stalking Audrey Young. And she has no idea why.</p> <p>It’s bad enough that she’s back in Tilikum. But Audrey’s good at making the best of things and her new job at the small-town newspaper is just a way to get back on her feet.</p> <p>Complicating matters is her landlord and new neighbor, Josiah Haven.</p> <p>She doesn’t usually go for the big, surly lumberjack type. But there’s something about that broody man. He intimidates her a little, but she kind of likes it.</p> <p>She could totally handle the mess that is her life, except the strange feeling of being watched is just the beginning. Next thing Audrey knows, she’s a target, and she doesn’t know who’s behind it or why.</p> <p>For Josiah Haven, none of that makes her his problem.</p> <p>She’s just the girl next door. Fine, the frustratingly hot girl next door. But Audrey is all sunshine, and her goofy dog isn’t any better. Josiah is too stoic. Too solitary. Too guarded. He doesn’t need a woman in his life, especially one who threatens to crack his heart wide open.</p> <p>But Josiah is a protector, and he can’t let Audrey’s troubles go unanswered, even if he has to risk everything—his life and his heart—to keep her safe.</p> <p><b>Author’s note</b>: A grumpy loner meets his match in a sunshiney dog lover who’s a little down on her luck. And once he falls, he falls hard. It’s small-town romantic suspense with CK’s signature humor, endearing characters, and heartwarming happily ever after.</p> <p><i>Obsession Falls</i> can be listened to as a stand-alone.</p>";
