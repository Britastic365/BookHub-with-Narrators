window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>There’s one thing they don’t tell you about men without souls when they’re cast into damnation. Once we make a home for ourselves in hell, there’s nothing left to fear from life. And a man without fear is a man without limits. I hadn't had any limits in 10 long years. </p> <p>This is a brand new dark menage series set in the same world as the Brutal Boys of Everlake Prep series with character crossover. Each series can be listened independent of each other and the lead female character will end up with more than one love interest.</p>";
