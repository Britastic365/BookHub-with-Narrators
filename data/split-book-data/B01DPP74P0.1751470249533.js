window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>USA Today </i></b><b>bestselling author Katee Robert continues her smoking-hot series about two feuding families—and their wealthy, powerful, and scandalous secrets.</b></p> <p>Carrigan O'Malley has always known her arranged marriage would be more about power and prestige than passion. But after one taste of the hard-bodied, whiskey-voiced James Halloran, she's ruined for anyone else. Too bad James and his family are enemy number 1.</p> <p>Hallorans vs. O'Malleys—that's how it's always been. James should be thinking more about how to expand his family's empire instead of how silky Carrigan's skin is against his and how he can next get her into his bed. Those are dangerous thoughts. But not nearly as dangerous as he'll be if he can't get what he wants: Carrigan by his side for the rest of their lives.</p> <p><b>(previously published as </b><b><i>The Wedding Pact</i></b><b>)</b></p>";
