Luckily, there’s help available for failed kidnappers: a diploma offered by the Intergalactic University. To complete their course, these three sexy aliens need to abduct a human female - and they’re graded on it. </p> <p>The problem is, the human female has no intentions of being abducted, not even to help them get the universe’s most recognised abduction qualification. </p> <p><b>A hilarious sci-fi reverse harem with clueless aliens and the human woman they’re trying to seduce (and probe). Beware, these aliens have fangs and tails and are ready to put them to good use.</b></p>";
