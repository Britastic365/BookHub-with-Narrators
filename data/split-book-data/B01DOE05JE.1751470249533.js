Now they must quickly advance from a culture equivalent to our Renaissance to the point where they can leave their planet. </p> <p>While the Quintaglios rush to develop space travel, the discovery of a second species of intelligent dinosaur rocks their most fundamental beliefs. Meanwhile, blind Afsan - the dinosaurian Galileo - undergoes the newfangled treatment of psychoanalysis, throwing everything he thought he knew about his violent people into a startling new light. </p>";
