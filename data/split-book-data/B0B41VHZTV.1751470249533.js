window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>The apocalypse has reawakenedâ€”and it wants blood.</i></b><i><br> <br> </i>The Echo devoured our world, then slept for months. But now its convulsions threaten to destroy the safe little community I and my fellow survivors have built in an untouched wilderness. I can't let that happen. Maybe it's the cop in me or the Army veteran in me, but I need to take action.<br> <br> By going inside the parallel world known as the Echo. A hell full of ravenous beasts.<br> <br> I can't do it alone, though. And the only person I'll risk taking with me is Erin Harding, a former Marine who's also a loose cannon. The fact that I'm attracted to her only makes our mission more dangerous. Because I can barely restrain my lust for Erin. But I will never let her know that.<br> <br> To save Earth, we must penetrate the heart of the Echo and somehow seize control of it. Piece of cake. It's not like we have no idea how to do that.<br> <br> Yeah, we're all screwed.<br> <i><br> </i><b><i>Echo Dominion is the second book in the Echo Power Trilogy of dark, steamy paranormal romances.</i></b></p>";
