As I dust and polish the Park Suite, in walks Mr. Dirty Grin—now with an icy glare.</p> <p>Why is the man from last night who was so charming (and good with his tongue) so furious this morning? As I piece together the puzzle, I discover the guest in the Park Suite is none other than Ben Fort, the reclusive tech mogul I want to work for.</p> <p>Ben has kept his identity hidden for years and he wants to know how I figured him out overnight.</p> <p>As he questions me, I don’t waste time telling him he’s a (super-hot) grump who needs to lighten up—and give me a job. I don’t want to sleep my way to the top, and he doesn’t trust me. But neither of us can resist the sizzling sparks that fly every time I fluff his pillows.</p>";
