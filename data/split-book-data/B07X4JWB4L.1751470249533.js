window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A painter with a spark in his hands. A muse who holds a storm inside of her. Colors will bring them together, but life will rip them apart. </p> <p>This is a dark romance filled with heartbreak, magic, violence, and love. The powerful prose will show you the real meaning of colors and the depth of life. Because he’s the prodigal painter who makes beauty from nothing, and she’s the rain that carries the world's pain in her eyes. Together, they'll leech all color from the world before filling it back in again, and you'll never forget their epic love story. </p> <p>She almost turned around. She almost wrapped her arms around him. She almost gave in. But she didn’t. She couldn’t. “I shouldn’t have come,” she said on a whisper. God, why did she come here? Why did she allow herself such selfishness? Why can’t she just let him go? Willow turned to look at him. His eyes flickered across her face, taking in all the tears that tracked down her cheeks. He brought a hand up to cup her cheek, catching the colors and letting them sink into his skin. She brought her hand up to his, at first just to feel the warmth of him one last time. “I can't stay. You look at the colors and are consumed with the beauty. I look at the colors, and I’m consumed with the pain.\" </p> <p><b>Author's note: This book is intended for mature audiences only.
