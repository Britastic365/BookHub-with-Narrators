window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Humans aren't as alone as they choose to believe. Every human possesses a trait of supernatural that lays dormant within their genetic make-up. Centuries of diluting and breeding have allowed humans to think they are alone and untouched by magic. But what happens when something changes? </p> <p>Eliana Sawyer's life was rocked from its foundation twice in as many years. She risked her heart and had it shattered into 1,000 pieces when Malik left her with no warning. While she'd normally raise her chin and ignore the pain, she can't forget what he gave her before he disappeared from her life. </p> <p>Malik Ward is a prince amongst the lion shifters and knows that one day he will have to take a mate. Only, his people can never mate with humans. Under the mistaken impression that Eliana was only human, he forced himself to leave before they'd crossed a line and he broke his vow to his people. Now that he knows the truth about Eliana, however, it will take more than groveling to win back the one woman fated to be his. </p> <p>While Eliana and Malik embark on a new sensuous path that might lead to disaster, the realms aren't ready to allow the final lightning-struck human to be enveloped into their fold. The couple will have to combat those plotting against them, as well as the broken promises and heated emotions they share. </p>";
