window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Mafia Romance realized by the dark mind that brought you the Hollow's Row Series and the Darkly, Madly Duet.</p> <p>Dominic: Brianna Cassatto is off-limits. From the moment our families formed an alliance through marriage, she became untouchable. To not only me—but every man. I made sure of that by threatening all who dares to look her way.</p> <p>In the dark underworld of mafia monsters and villains, there is nothing more dangerous than the desire for a woman you cannot have. That temptation can drive a man mad, make him do the unthinkable.</p> <p>And when Bria is promised to my enemy, the beast within goes feral, far beyond the mere unthinkable.</p> <p>I’m a devil with a stolen birthright, ready to reclaim my legacy and empire. With the atrocities I’ve vowed to commit, I’ll be on my way to hell.</p> <p>And I’m taking sweet Bria with me.</p> <p>Brianna: For two years, I’ve waited for Dominic Erasto to see me as more than an unwanted stepsister, a burden, even an obstacle to his crown. He thinks of me as a spoiled mafia princess just waiting to be married off to the highest bidder.</p> <p>But when that day arrives, no peace will be bought with my hand—not when the devil himself declares war. His spoils: Me.</p> <p>But I’m no wilting flower. Raised in a ruthless world, I will draw blood as quickly as he deems to steal it. And when the devil comes to take me, I will be his ruin.</p> <p>CW: Content warnings and guidelines can be found on the author's website</p>";
