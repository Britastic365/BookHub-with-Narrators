window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>She was only meant to make the royal wedding gown, not wear it. </i></b></p> <p>Belle never dreamed of ballrooms or crowns—she dreamed of seams and silks, of becoming the most sought-after dressmaker in all of Solmane. But when the fae princess flees her arranged marriage, Belle is left holding the wedding gown. As the fearsome Beast Prince prowls towards her looking to collect his bride, it's either pretend to be the fairy princess so her dress gets a chance to be seen by potential new clients or get sent back home poor and empty handed. She only has to hold the lie while the guards hunt down the runaway. But standing before the Beast Prince with his powerful form and disarming mix of gruffness and vulnerability, Belle discovers something she didn’t bargain for: a heart that might finally understand hers.</p> <p>Born cursed in a partial shift between man and beast, Prince Adom of Pridehaven has resigned himself to a marriage he never wanted. Marrying the fae princess chosen by the moon god is the only way to break his family's curse and rid the land of the trolls that plague them. Love has no place in his life. But the woman standing before him is nothing like he imagined—spirited, sincere, and entirely captivating. Against all odds, Adom’s frozen heart begins to thaw.</p> <p>Too bad secrets have a way of unraveling even the most carefully stitched plans. Belle isn't the real princess, and marrying Adom won’t break his curse leaving the fate of his kingdom and both their futures at stake.</p> <p><b>On Lunaterra, fate is a cruel matchmaker—binding enemies, forging impossible alliances, and turning betrayal into desire. When kingdoms fall, curses rise, and war looms, love is the most dangerous game of all.</b></p>";
