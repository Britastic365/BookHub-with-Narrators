window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Dane Donovan is in Paris, but he is not starting over. Neither is he looking back. He’s picking up where he left off—now, more than ever, determined to get it right. Four years ago she was a mistake, but unfortunately for Dane, walking away may not be an option this time around.</p> <p>To bring her cousin home, Zera Kennedy would give up everything she worked for… including the first man to capture her heart. But now that the kidnapper’s trail has gone cold, Zera is not sure she’ll be able to achieve her goal, and until she does, returning to her home in Kenya is not an option. Neither is staying away from Dane Donovan once he walks back into her life. But the moment they both let down their guard and believe in the love that gives them a new look on life, fear invades their tender reunion and threatens every kiss, every moan, every… breath they take.</p>";
