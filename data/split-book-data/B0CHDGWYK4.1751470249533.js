window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Chloe and Brandon have nothing in common. She’s a spontaneous, people-loving fiber artist; he’s an uptight, introverted law student. The only thing they agree on during their blind date is that they hope to never see each other again. Except they do have something in common—Brandon’s mother Dawn, who happens to be Chloe’s boss and dear friend. And that's how they end up stuck with each other for a six-hour road trip to Dawn’s destination wedding.</p> <p>But as they get to know each other better, their mutual irritation morphs into an inescapable connection. Maybe these two opposites aren't so mismatched after all. Could Brandon be the yin to Chloe’s yang? The peanut butter to her jelly? The rock to her roll? Or will their differences tear them apart when they return to their normal lives at the end of the wedding weekend?</p> <p>Book six in the Common Threads series, Seduction in the City World, Ewe Complete Me is a full-length enemies-to-lovers contemporary romance set in the Penny Reid Book Universe that can be listened to as a standalone.</p>";
