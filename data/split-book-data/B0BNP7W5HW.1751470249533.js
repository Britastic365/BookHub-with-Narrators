window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Tide goes into town for a bit of fun: he can’t wait to get his hands on a human female.</b></p> <p>Even though his evening doesn’t pan out as expected, a bit of fun is exactly what he gets. He is shocked when the same female turns up on dragon territory as their new healer. Tide does not believe in coincidence. Who is she really and why is she here?</p> <p>Doctor Meghan Roberts can't believe it when she lands the job of a lifetime. Imagine her surprise when she ends up accused of stalking the shifter she spent the night with some months ago. The arrogant a-hole seems to think that she would stoop so low as to go through his phone and wallet for information to have orchestrated this whole thing. It's a great pity he's assigned to protect her during her stay on dragon territory. Tide is going to be her very annoying shadow for the foreseeable future. What's worse is that's she's still attracted to him.</p> <p>Tide is comfortable taking the assignment to keep an eye on the new healer. He’s still not completely convinced this whole thing was a coincidence. Her job is to find a cure for their silver affliction. Something essential to the continuation of the dragon species. Something he, therefore, takes seriously. The little healer might be attractive, but he never ruts the same female twice. What could go wrong?</p> <p><i>Dragon Prince </i>is the final installment of The Bride Hunt series, but it can be listened to as a standalone. It contains strong sexual themes and language, and is cliffhanger-free with a guaranteed HEA.</p>";
