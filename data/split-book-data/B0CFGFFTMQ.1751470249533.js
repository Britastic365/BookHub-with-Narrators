He brought a hellhound with him. Every time his hellbeast kills, the bastard gets stronger. He's unstoppable. Stronger and faster than any vampire I've ever encountered. Have I finally met my match?</p> <p>On top of that, my ex-vampire lover is on a tear. I need to rally every vampire I can find. I've teamed up with Prince Ladinas and the Vampire Underground. These vampires aren't much for the democratic processes of the Vampire Council. They need a bloody queenâ€”and I'm just the bitch for the job.</p>";
