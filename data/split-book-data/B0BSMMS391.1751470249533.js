window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>My name is Danica Knight, and I have a secret…a life-changing, whisper-worthy secret that will more than likely get me killed.</p> <p>\"Trust no one\" is the singular phrase my mother had whispered to me when she abandoned me in a small hospital at the young age of eight. It was the only memory I could remember before I came to live with my aunt and uncles here in the largest wolf pack in North America.</p> <p>After graduating high school and having been accepted into one of the most prestigious paranormal universities in North America, Black Veil University, everything is finally going as planned. Or so I thought before four insanely hot men crashed their way into my life—each with a unique connection to me whether they want it or not. We are tied together. Lives are turned upside down, hearts are torn and shattered, and those deep, dark secrets that I have held hostage start to slip. But when the dark shadows of my past come knocking, I may need every little bit of help I can get.</p> <p><i>Knight Ascending</i> is book one of five in the Black Veil University series, which <i>does</i> end on a cliffhanger. This is a university-aged, slow-burn, slow-build paranormal RH romance, which means there will be no choosing between love interests at the end of the story.</p> <p>This series has darker elements that listeners should be aware of such as strong language, PTSD from kidnapping, assault, and violence.</p>";
