window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the cold spring air of Lukos, a man wraps a cloak of fur around his shoulders and transforms into a sleek white wolf, racing across the countryside....</p> <p>Zephyr has always been cursed. The same fur that gives him the ability to shift between wolf and man allows others the power to control his will. Doomed to follow any order given by one who holds his cloak, Zephyr steals it from his tyrannical foster-father and takes off into the wilderness. He’s heard stories of the wolf-people of Lukos, the ones who don’t hide away in the caves Zephyr grew up in but build houses to weather the harsh winter, but there’s no telling what they’ll do when they see him. Even here, Zephyr knows he will never be truly safe. </p> <p>Dragan Wolf-Breaker has spent his life leading the people of Lukos and raising his daughter, Elena, as a single father. When the injured white wolf who collapsed on his door turns out to be a man mistreated by those who were supposed to protect him, Dragan slowly begins to earn Zephyr’s trust by showing him that his submission is a gift, not a curse. But as the weather grows warmer in Lukos, the danger from Zephyr’s former life grows closer than ever, threatening his new home and his new life with Dragan. </p> <p><i>Spring of the Wolf</i> features a powerful dominant with a firm hand and a protective streak, a wolf-shifter submissive with a need to be settled and yearning to be safe, and an ancient curse that can only be undone through the bonds of love, trust, friendship, and family.</p>";
