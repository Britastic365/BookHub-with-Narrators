window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A wildfire rages in the foothills outside Evangeline Everhardt’s hometown, and the power utility company has accused Eve’s brother of starting it. Aaron Ashe seems like the type: a long-time drug addict, a disgruntled former employee, and recently killed resisting arrest by a sheriff’s deputy. He’s not even buried before SE&amp;G is pointing the finger.</p> <p>When Eve’s husband, Sergeant Deputy Hank Everhardt, won’t fight to clear Aaron’s name, Eve takes the investigation into her own hands. Eve hunts for the only witness to Aaron’s death only to find the girl missing. Someone is eager to keep Aaron’s case quiet … and Eve has to figure out who before wildfires turn the evidence to ashes.</p> <p>A successor to <i>She Killed Him First</i> by <i>New York Times</i> and <i>USA Today</i> bestselling author SM Reine.</p>";
