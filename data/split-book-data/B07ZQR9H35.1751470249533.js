window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Retrieve Jensen was desperate. He was working himself into the ground seven days a week to try to save his family’s legacy - their cattle ranch in Montana. But one day he wondered who the heck he was doing all this backbreaking labor for, when he didn’t have a child and there wasn’t a prospect for marriage in sight. He wasn’t looking for true love - didn’t believe in it anyway. He wanted more of a partner - someone who could at least ride if not rope, who wanted children, and who knew how to cook and clean.</p> <p>When Jayne Clarkson’s friend laid the classified ad on her desk, while making a sarcastic comment about the intelligence of its writer, instead of being repelled, Jayne found herself intrigued by someone who would call himself a “no nonsense” man.</p> <p>While her horrified friends watched what they were sure was going to be a train wreck, Jayne contacted Trieve and ended up spending a month with him in Montana.</p> <p>Sparks flew between the two of them immediately, and although they were dynamite in bed - and he had proven to be even more “no nonsense” than she thought she could handle and he’d given her more than her first spanking over those four fantastic weeks - they both knew that she wasn’t really what he was looking for.</p> <p>Or was she?</p>";
