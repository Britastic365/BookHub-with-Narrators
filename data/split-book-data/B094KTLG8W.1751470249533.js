Nothing in her life is ever easy.</p> <p>Nord and Lina may have dealt with her murderer, but along the way, they also managed to land themselves at the top of several hit lists. Now the Drakes, the Brotherhood, and even the mysterious King of the Underground, Crombie, all want a piece of them.</p> <p>One unhappy supernatural order they could probably handle.
