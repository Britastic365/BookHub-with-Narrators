window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>“London’s second Royal Match Victorian romance sparkles by pairing a rebellious princess with a reclusive duke…The witty repartee between Amelia and Joshua propels the novel forward while revealing the complex depths of the characters. Readers won’t want to put this down.”—</b><b><i>Publishers Weekly </i></b><b>on </b><b><i>The Duke Not Taken</i></b><br> <br> <b><i>Impossible. Infuriating. Intoxicating.</i></b><br> <br> Ever since her sister became queen two years ago, Amelia Ivanosen, Princess of Wesloria, has been flirting and skirting scandal—just barely. Before she does anything <i>too</i> outlandish, she is sent to England and Lila Alexander, illustrious matchmaker to the <i>ton</i>, is recruited. Respectably ensconced at the country estate of a family friend, Amelia is introduced to many eligible bachelors, but…there is no spark. There never seems to be unless the man is completely wrong for her.<br> <br> Next door lives Joshua Parker, Duke of Marley, who is grumpy and reclusive—for good reason. His first wife died in childbirth. When Marley is dragged by a friend to his neighbor’s soiree, he and Amelia <i>instantly</i> dislike each other. Their banter is snarky and heated. He’s a stuck-up smarty-pants; she’s a self-involved, annoying princess.<br> <br> Sparks fly when they’re together—fireworks actually—but they loathe each other. Really. So why can’t they stop thinking about each other?<br> <br> <b>A Royal Match</b><br> <br> <b>Book 1: </b><b><i>Last Duke Standing</i></b><b><br> Book 2: </b><b><i>The Duke Not Taken</i></b></p>";
