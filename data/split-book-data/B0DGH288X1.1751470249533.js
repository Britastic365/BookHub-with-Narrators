window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Life can change in the blink of an eye, or in my case, one minute.</b></p> <p>Fifty years ago, supernaturals walked amongst humans, hidden in plain sight. Overnight, the world changed. The veil shattered, revealing their true nature, and humans were forced into sectors so those with preternatural blood could flourish out in the open.</p> <p>Every human's twenty-first birthday is marked by a rite of passage. The Awakening, as the supers call it. It's simple. We dip our toes into a God-made lagoon, then go home.</p> <p>Sounds fun, right?</p> <p>Not!</p> <p>I should know. The illusion that was my life was shattered in the one minute I stood in that lagoon, and now I'm off to an academy to learn all about life on the other side of the sectors.</p> <p>It's not all glitter and rainbows. From what I'm told, I'm dangerous. Me, standing tall at five-foot-two. They say there are those who seek to use me. Kill me. I take what they say with a grain of salt, but after the first attempt on my life, I know I need to focus on staying alive as much as I focus on my studies.</p> <p>Can the professors at the academy teach me to use my powers quickly enough to protect myself, or will I suffer the same fate as those who came before me?</p> <p>Shattered Illusion <i>is the first book of the Stonewell Academy series. This is a why-choose novel which means our heroine won't have to choose between any of the guys in her life. And trust, there are plenty. For mature listeners.</i></p>";
