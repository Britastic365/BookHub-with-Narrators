window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>What may we become? How will we endure? The future is a daunting realm, filled with real and imagined perils. So enter it prepared! Here are vivid tales about possible tomorrows, from the keen eye and colorful pen of David Brin, a modern master of speculative fiction. </p> <p>Visit a chillingly plausible tomorrow, when prisoners may be sent to asteroidal gulags. Or might prisons vanish and felons roam, seeing only what society allows? Suppose, amid lavish success, we gain the superpower to fly! Will we even appreciate it, or will we find new reasons to complain? In \"Mars Opposition\", you'll experience an alien invasion like no other, confronting humanity with a stark and terrible choice; followed by several more tales of conquest from beyond, each of them wildly different. On the other hand, might fantastically potent new beings emerge out of ourselves, as revealed in \"Chrysalis\"? </p> <p>Featuring guest appearances by Gregory Benford, Jules Verne, and Galileo, this adventure takes you beyond the very singularity in \"Stones of Significance\", pondering what could happen after humans are like gods. And \"Reality Check\" asks one of you listeners - just one of you - to wake up! </p> <p>Tomorrow awaits. We can face it and prevail. So long as our stance is brave <i>Insistence of Vision</i>. </p>";
