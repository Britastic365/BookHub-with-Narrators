window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>New York Times</i> best-selling author P. C. Cast's Goddess Summoning series continues as a modern woman attempts to tame a wild beast with the power of love. </p> <p>Empousai family roses have bloomed for centuries, thanks to the drops of blood their women sacrifice for their gardens. But Mikki would rather forget this family quirk and lead a normal life. Until she unwittingly performs a ritual, ending up in the strangely familiar Realm of the Rose. As its goddess Hecate reveals, Mikki is a priestess - and the Realm's been waiting for her. </p> <p>Long ago, an enraged Hecate cursed her guardian beast and the entire Realm with a slumber only a priestess can undo - and she's counting on Mikki to set things right. The beast at first terrifies Mikki, but soon intrigues her more than any man ever has. Now, the only way he and the Realm can be saved is for Mikki to sacrifice her life-giving blood - and herself. </p>";
