window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>He'll do anything for his wounded warrior… even wooing him a widow.</b></p> <p>In a world of orcs and men, Lady Scall is a widow besieged—by her debts, her demons, and her dangerous lord neighbor. But time is running out, and she's about to lose everything…</p> <p>Until the night an orc shows up in her chambers.</p> <p>Killik is a cold, cruel, condescending spy, and he wants nothing to do with Lady Scall… for himself. But he's decided she's the perfect woman for his clanmate Ulfarr, the Wolf of Clan Skai. Ulfarr isn't just any orc. He's a huge, broken, brutal monster with a dark, deadly past.</p> <p>Killik wants Lady Scall to help Ulfarr. To heal Ulfarr. To handle Ulfarr however she pleases. In return, Killik will solve all her problems—and he'll teach her how to tend and tame an orc. And maybe, if she behaves, he'll fulfill all her own deepest longings, too…</p> <p>But even a desperate, lonely widow shouldn't risk such a scandalous affair, right? Especially when Ulfarr's secrets are darker than she ever imagined, and Killik is far more jealous than she knew.</p> <p>A deal with two devils might draw more doom to her door… and her heart.</p> <p>The Widow and the Orcs is an<i> angsty, enemies-to-lovers fantasy romance. It comes after</i> The Beauty and the Orcs <i>but can be enjoyed as a standalone. Happily ever after guaranteed.</i></p>";
