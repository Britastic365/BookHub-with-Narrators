window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Now in development as a feature film with Amazon MGM Studios, with </b><b><i>John Wick</i></b><b> screenwriter Derek Kolstad attached to write the script!</b><br> <br> <b><i>Shield of Sparrows</i></b><b> is a slow-burn, high-stakes romantasy perfect for fans of Sarah J. Maas and Rebecca Yarros—where enemies become lovers, monsters stalk a cursed realm, and a forgotten princess finds the strength to tear off her crown and become the warrior she was never meant to be.</b><br> <br> The gods sent monsters to the five kingdoms to remind mortals they must kneel.<br> <br> I’ve spent my life kneeling—to their will and to my father's. As a princess, my only duty is to wear the crown and obey the king.<br> <br> I was never meant to rule. Never meant to fight. And I was never supposed to be the daughter who sealed an ancient treaty with her own blood.<br> <br> But that changed the fateful day I stepped into my father’s throne room. The day a legendary monster hunter sailed to our shores. The day a prince ruined my life.<br> <br> Now I’m crossing treacherous lands beside a warrior who despises me as much as I despise him—bound to a future I didn’t choose and a husband I barely know.<br> <br> Everyone wants me to be something I’m not—a queen, a spy, a sacrifice.<br> <br> But what if I refused the role chosen for me? What if I made my own rules? What if there’s power in being underestimated?<br> <br> And what if—for the first time—I reached for it?</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
