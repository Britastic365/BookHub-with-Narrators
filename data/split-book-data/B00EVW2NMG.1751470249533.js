window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Experts in the art of stealing time, Travellers live on the edge of both mortal and immortal realms. But a few fight their outlaw instincts. </p> <p>Gwenhwyfar Byron Owens learned everything she knows about potions and spells from her two Wiccan moms, who are forbidden by Otherworld laws to teach magic to mortals. But when their latest transgression results in the kidnapping of a mortal woman, Gwen figures the only place to hide them all is in Summerland, the Wiccan afterlife. But Gregory Faa - a member of the Watch - is hot on their heels. A Traveller who has stolen time, he's eager to prove himself worthy of the Watch, only he has a past with the dark-eyed Welsh beauty he's been charged with bringing to justice. He's tempted to just let Gwen disappear into Summerland until he realizes that she's being pursued by a squad of goons \"and\" death's minions. Gwen is used to taking care of her moms and herself, so she can't give in to her heart's demand to trust Gregory, despite the fact that he's as handsome as the day is long - and the days in Summerland last centuries.</p>";
