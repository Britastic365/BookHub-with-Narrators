window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A Second Chance/Forced Proximity Gay Romance</b><br> <br> Kaz has a choice to make. Should he transition to vampire in the lab, becoming another rat under Uriel's thumb? Or should he take a chance and return to the team? The team who still believes he betrayed them. Who think of him as a traitorous spy. Who'll probably decide to lash him to a stake and burn him beside the begonias with Daniel holding the torch.<br> <br> As he's never been a coward, Kaz decides to put his vulnerable life in the hands of the team. He'll explain why he was forced to lie and hide the truth. That the threats focused toward the team were serious and the schemes the archangels devised had to be stopped. Some may believe him, but not the most important team member. Daniel will never trust him again.<br> <br> Danny is spending too much energy composing sad songs and arguing with anyone who pokes their head into the office to see how he’s doing. He’s fine. Really. He’s fine. But when a bleeding, wingless Kaz tumbles through the portal he’s positive the fates are not done messing with him. After doing what he can, he leaves the rest of the team to deal with Kaz and takes off to spend a few days with his friends. Maybe order in a deliciously handsome blood donor. Exactly what he needs to keep his mind off Kaz and his delicious scent and his wicked smile.<br> <br> Only a call comes in that a pack of rogue vampires have taken over parts of San Francisco, killing innocents and turning the residents' lives into a living nightmare. Kaz is the logical vampire to send to scope out the situation and report back. Only his behavior has been erratic, and the team captain wants Danny to accompany him. Now Danny has to take charge of the mission and make sure the male who broke his heart keeps his hands and mouth and...everything else...as far away from him as possible!</p> <p>Other Books by Marie Booth: <b>Santa Cruz Vampire Series-M/M</b>: <i>Banished by Blood, Broken by Blood</i>.
