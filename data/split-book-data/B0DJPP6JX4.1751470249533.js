A war like no other.</b></p> <p>When the research starship Galileo vanishes without a trace, the powers-that-be are quick to bury the incident, eager to prevent escalating tensions that could lead to war. As a former POW, Soren refuses to give the ship up for lost.</p> <p>His daughter is one of the missing.</p> <p>Taking matters into his own hands, Soren starts pulling strings and calling in favors, determined to launch a clandestine mission to bring Galileo home. When an old friend offers him a ship for the operation, he expects a rusty relic headed for the scrapyard.</p> <p>Instead, he's given the Wraith—an unfinished, experimental starship with plenty of potential and just as many problems. A marvel of engineering…if his crew can keep her running.</p> <p>They’d better.</p> <p>Because Galileo’s disappearance is just the beginning. War is coming to the Federation from the most unlikely of places.</p> <p>And Soren may be the only one who can stop it.</p>";
