window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Abel Jin and Delilah Johnson have lived their lives with holes in their souls, yearning for something they don't understand. Until one night Delilah is in mortal danger, and a man who's otherworldly strong and supernaturally fast saves her. Delilah is then cast into a world where fiction comes to life in the form of Abel, her destined mate, a vampire/werewolf hybrid who claims her at first breath as his. But Abel knows the danger isn't done. He's dreamed for centuries that his mate will perish, and he will stop at nothing to keep her safe. </p> <p>For Delilah, she's coping not only with a fantasy come to life but also with a mingling of very different families. Not to mention she has on her hands a man who doesn't understand his true nature and has lived his long life thinking he's a monster. Abel and Delilah together fill the hole that has been clawing at them for decades. But, finally finding each other, it also tips their destinies as the last of The Three. They must unite with the other destined lovers, who, with Abel and Delilah, are fated to save the world. Or die trying. </p>";
