window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This box set contains \"Baking Me Crazy\" and \"Batter of Wits\" by Karla Sorensen.</p> <p>\"Baking Me Crazy\", book one:</p> <p>I'm Levi Buchanan, and until five years ago, I thought the legend of my family's curse was a load of crazy, Southern nonsense. <br> <br> No curse can make you fall in love at first sight. No curse can force a true, deep, passionate, all-consuming love that will haunt you all the days of your life. <br> <br> Then, I met Jocelyn Abernathy, and I realized how completely wrong I was. <br> <br> The problem is, Jocelyn guards her feelings like well-armed soldier. She's the most beautiful, stubborn, infuriating woman I've ever met. Every time she talks, I want to kiss the living daylights out of her. But I can't. <br> <br> Because when we met, she didn't need true love. She needed a best friend. And that's what I've been to her...for five years. <br> <br> But when Jocelyn meets a handsome stranger her first day working at Donner Bakery and she lets him buy her a dill pickle cupcake, I realize, with ominous regret, that I may have missed my window with my best friend. <br> <br> If I can't get her to see past our friendship, my new curse may be to watch the love of my life move on with someone else.</p> <p>\"Baking Me Crazy\" is a full-length contemporary romance, but can be listened to as a standalone.</p> <p>\"Batter of Wits\", book two:</p> <p>Hate at first sight couldn’t possibly exist, right? <br> <br> That’s what Grace Buchanan thought, before her useless car stranded her on the side of a deserted road just inside the Green Valley city limits. <br> <br> When Tucker Haywood—tall and handsome and full of southern charm—shows up to help, her reaction to him is the strongest thing she’s ever felt in her life, and it makes no freaking sense. <br> <br> It doesn’t make much sense to Tucker either. Not why she hates him, or why he finds her so intriguing. He knows well enough that Grace is moving to Green Valley for a fresh start, not to distract him when he’s got no room for something like her in his life. <br> <br> The complications between them are endless, but that doesn’t stop her definitely not love-at-first-sight feelings from changing into something else entirely. <br> <br> Grace and Tucker are about to learn the hard way that in Green Valley, hating someone has never tasted so sweet.</p> <p>\"Batter of Wits\" is a full-length contemporary romance, but can be listened to as a standalone.</p>";
