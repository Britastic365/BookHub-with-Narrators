Nobody said it might actually get her killed. </p> <p>The sci-fi saga that began with the breakout best seller <i>Illuminae</i> continues onboard the Jump Station <i>Heimdall</i>, where two new characters will confront the next wave of the BeiTech assault. </p> <p>Hanna is the station captain's pampered daughter, Nik the reluctant member of a notorious crime family. But while the pair are struggling with the realities of life aboard the galaxy's most boring space station, little do they know that Kady Grant and the <i>Hypatia</i> are headed right toward <i>Heimdall</i>, carrying news of the Kerenza invasion. </p> <p>When an elite BeiTech strike team invades the station, Hanna and Nik are thrown together to defend their home. But alien predators are picking off the station residents one by one, and a malfunction in the station's wormhole means the space-time continuum might be ripped in two before dinner. Soon Hanna and Nik aren't just fighting for their own survival; the fate of everyone on the <i>Hypatia</i> - and possibly the known universe - is in their hands. </p> <p>But relax. They've totally got this. They hope. </p> <p>Once again told through a compelling dossier of emails, IMs, classified files, transcripts, and schematics, <i>Gemina </i>raises the stakes of the Illuminae Files, hurling listeners into an enthralling new story that will leave them breathless. </p> <p>Narrated by Carla Corvo, MacLeod Andrews, Steve West, Erik Davies, Lisa Cordileone, and a full cast. </p> <p>Praise for <i>Illuminae</i> </p> <p>A <i>New York Times</i> Best seller </p> <p>A <i>PW</i> Best seller </p> <p>“Out-of-this-world awesome.” (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>, Starred) </p> <p>“Stylistically mesmerizing.” (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>, Starred) </p> <p>“An arresting visual experience.” (<i>Booklist</i>, Starred)</p> <p>“A game-changer.” (<i>Shelf Awareness,</i> Starred)</p>";
