window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A Duchy of Terra spin-off series.</b></p> <p><i>Fifty thousand years ago, the Precursors broke the universe. Now, great powers and small alike fight over their wreckage.</i></p> <p>But in the midst of the chaos, there is a question no one asks: why?</p> <p>Morgan Casimir, commander of the A!Tol Imperial cruiser <i>Defiant</i>, has seen the works of the Precursor aliens known as the Alava. She has seen their accidents threaten worlds and consume entire star fleets. Charged by her empress to prevent a conspiracy of profiteers from finding and using a lost fleet of Alava warships, she knows unimaginable catastrophe looms if she fails. With her lover, xenoarcheologist Dr. Rin Dunst, at her side, she is sent to a hot zone on the edge of war to once again achieve the impossible.</p> <p>But as they search along a border flaring in violence, Morgan discovers that if the worst comes to pass, her orders are to destroy the ships rather than allow them to be taken...and she realizes that there just might be a reason seemingly godlike aliens lost an entire fleet.</p>";
