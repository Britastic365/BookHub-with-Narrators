window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From number-one </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best seller Vi Keeland, comes a new, sexy stand-alone novel. </b></p> <p>Terminated for inappropriate behavior. <br> I couldn’t believe the letter in my hands. <br> Nine years. Nine damn years I’d worked my butt off for one of the largest companies in America, and I was fired with a form letter when I returned home from a week in Aruba. <br> All because of a video taken when I was on vacation with my friends - a <i>private</i> video made on my <i>private</i> time. <i>Or so I thought.... </i><br> Pissed off, I cracked open a bottle of wine and wrote my own letter to the gazillionaire CEO telling him what I thought of his company and its practices. <br> I didn’t think he’d actually respond. <br> I certainly never thought I’d suddenly become pen pals with the rich jerk. <br> Eventually, he realized I’d been wronged and made sure I got my job back. <br> Only…it wasn’t the only thing Grant Lexington wanted to do for me. <br> But there was no way I was getting involved with my boss’s boss’s boss. Even if he was ridiculously gorgeous, confident, and charming. <br> It would be completely wrong, inappropriate even. <br> Sort of like the video that got me into trouble to begin with. <br> Two wrongs don’t make a right. <br> But sometimes it’s twice as fun.</p>";
