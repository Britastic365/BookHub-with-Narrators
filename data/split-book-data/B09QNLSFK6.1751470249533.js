window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>I thought that I was broken before, but my damage never tasted as bitter as this.</b></p> <p>The Harlequin boys are more than just a memory now. More than a daydream of our youth and an idea to cling onto. They’re my greatest weakness and my biggest regret, but I’ve started to realize that coming back to Sunset Cove was always my fate.</p> <p>My heart beats to the turn of the tide here. My skin only warms beneath this sun. And my soul will only ever be home on these streets and with the men who grew out of my memories. But nothing is the same as I remember, and the time for childish games is coming to an end.</p> <p>I may want to pretend that the last 10 years never happened, but the nightmare I lost myself in has followed me home, and I can’t keep ignoring the things I once did to survive. The question is, will my mistakes be the end of me and my boys? Will the choices I made then change everything now?</p> <p>And will the life I never wanted steal away my only chance at the life I’m afraid to wish for? </p> <p><b>This is an enemies-to-lovers contemporary series where the girl will end up with multiple love interests and all of the characters are in their late 20s. Trigger warning: This series features gangs, violence, dark romance, and jealous/possessive themes.</b></p>";
