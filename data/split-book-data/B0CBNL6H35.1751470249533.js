Now, only months after their siblings' wedding, Lilian Harte and Gabe Madison are at each other's throats.</p> <p>Successful CEO Gabe had insisted on becoming a client of Lilian's matchmaking service. And after five disastrous dates, Lilian is at her wit's end. If she hadn't already decided to close her business and move home to Eclipse Bay, Gabe would have been the final straw.
