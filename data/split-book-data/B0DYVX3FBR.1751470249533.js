window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A reluctant prince. A crumbling kingdom. A trial that will test his body, mind, and heart.</p> <p>Once in a generation, the dragon kingdoms must present their finest prince to compete for the hand of the future Celestial Empress. Bound by ancient tradition, these Chosen Princes are tasked with proving their worth—all while remaining celibate until the Celestial Courting Ceremony. For Zargris, the sole prince of the Twilight Kingdom, this was never a choice. Born in the perpetual shadow of the Celestial Mountain, Zargris finds himself thrust into a role he neither sought nor desired.</p> <p>With a wrathful sister who despises him, a domineering cousin who overshadows him, and a kingdom teetering on the edge of ruin, Zargris struggles to shoulder the weight of his title. As the trials begin, testing his endurance and resolve, Zargris discovers an unexpected bond with an enigmatic drake—one whose care and companionship may be the key to unlocking his buried potential.</p> <p>But will Zargris rise to embrace duty, compassion, and his destiny? Or will the stubborn prince crumble beneath the mounting pressure, succumbing to selfishness and pride?</p> <p>This story contains explicit erotic scenes involving dragons and drakes, not humans or shifters. It also features intense depictions of violence. For mature audiences only.</p>";
