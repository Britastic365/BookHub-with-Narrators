window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Number one in the entire Kindle Store. </p> <p>A new paranormal romance from <i>Wall Street Journal</i> and <i>USA Today</i> best seller Jaymin Eve. </p> <p><i>My father made a terrible mistake. One I’m left paying for. </i> </p> <p>As a wolf shifter growing up in a strong pack, I should be living my best life. But after my father tried to kill our leader, I’m labelled an outcast, traitor, less than dirt. </p> <p>When I can't take pack life any longer, I run, but apparently they don't like losing their punching bag. Torin, the leader’s son, drags me back before my first shift...a shift that will reveal my true mate. I never could have predicted who mine would be, but the moment my wolf looks upon him, I’m filled with hope for a brighter future. </p> <p>After all, no one ever rejects their true mate, right? </p> <p>Wrong. Very wrong. </p> <p>When the wolves attack, my soul screams for vengeance, and somehow I touch the shadow world. Somehow I bring him to our lands. </p> <p>The Shadow Beast. Our shifter god. The devil himself. </p> <p>Turns out being rejected by my mate was only the beginning. </p> <p>*If you like sexy, dark paranormal romances, with humor, steam, action, a tough heroine, and an antihero, this is for you. </p> <p><i>Rejected</i> is full-length (100,000 words), is book one in Shadow Beast Shifters series, and ends on a cliff-hanger. It's recommended for 18+ due to language and sexual situations.</p>";
