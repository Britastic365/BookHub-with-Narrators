window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>It’s revenge - sweet and hot - in the first book of this sexy and wickedly funny series by international bestselling author Tara Brown.</b></p> <p>For the young, rich, and beautiful, summertime in the Hamptons means one thing: Fling Club. Only this time, Cherry Kennedy won’t be selecting a boy for a fleeting romance. Nope, this season, Cherry is out for revenge. Her target? The Fling Club founder and society darling who slept with Cherry’s now-very-<i>ex</i>-boyfriend. And all Cherry needs is the perfect guy for her plan....</p> <p>Ashley Jardine can’t afford to refuse. He scored almost a full ride to MIT. But that <i>almost</i> still costs a lot. And this is <i>so</i> much money for a little game of revenge and a chance - albeit short - to live the high life. Here, rich girls rule the shore, and <i>everyone</i> has a role to play. Only nothing in the job description warned Ashley that the redhead who’s running the scheme would be so crazy. And cute. Or that he wouldn’t be able to stop thinking about her.</p> <p>Now, everything is going according to plan - until an unexpected attraction raises the stakes. It’s enough to turn the perfect payback into absolute heartbreak.</p>";
