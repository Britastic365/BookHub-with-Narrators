window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i><b>Read by the author, Tracy Whitwell.</b></i><br></p><p><b>There’s a queue of people at her door, and not all of them are living . . .</b><br><br>When Tanz, the accidental medium, is asked to help in the search for a missing woman, she finds herself at the Cross Bones Graveyard in London’s Southwark. From the outset it’s obvious there is unrest among the spirits who call this place their home, and now Tanz is right in the middle of it. What’s more, she finds her ‘so-called gift’ is now even stronger than before - and the dead really want to talk!<br><br>Couple this with performing a play that could wreck her acting career for good, and a growing attraction to a police officer who happens to be a lot younger than her, and life is very complicated. But when the dead become restless Tanz can’t ignore them, and a mystery needs solving. So is she strong enough to come out the other side?<br><br><b><i>Cross Bones</i> is the third audiobook in a hilarious series read by the author and featuring Tanz, the accidental medium who, with the help of the dead, has become an unwilling crime-solver.</b></p>";
