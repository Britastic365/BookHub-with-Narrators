window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Newly single Knight is done with relationships. All he's interested in is bringing down the Count, an internet personality who is tarnishing his family name. An opportunity to crush him comes when the audacious clown shows up at the Kings of Hell MC clubhouse to film for his YouTube channel. But when Knight meets Elliot, the man behind the Count, he no longer knows what to do with him. </p> <p>Knight has never seen a more pathetic creature than Elliot. He's also never met anyone who needed him more. Skinny, messed up, and a bucket of trouble as thick as tar, everything Elliot does seems to be a wordless death wish. No matter how much Knight hates Elliot's alter ego, under the makeup and theatrics hides a fragile young guy with a passion for history, and Knight can't help but catch Elliot every time he falls. </p> <p>Elliot has bad taste in men. Always hopelessly attracted to violent brutes, his favorite is a long-dead serial killer. But he gets more than he's bargained for when he seizes an opportunity to meet the man of his dreams. The ghost is manipulative and dangerous, offering Elliot all he's always wanted, for a price he can't possibly pay. </p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
