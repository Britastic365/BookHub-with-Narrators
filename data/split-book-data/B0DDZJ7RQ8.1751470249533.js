At my new school I meet the enigmatic Tainted Saints—three mesmerising men who become the protectors I never knew I needed.</p> <p>However, my sordid past unravels as the Ambassador, the man who sired me but will never earn the title of father, reveals his true depravity. With a shocking thirst for blood, he tests the limits of his monstrous nature.</p> <p>Can I escape his clutches and find true freedom? Or will my life be forever tethered to him instead of the deserving men who have captured my heart?</p> <p>\"Tainted Saints\" is a stand alone, compelling retelling, where our fearless heroine need not choose between her impassioned suitors.
