window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Baby’s heat is coming…</b></p> <p>After years of assuming she was a beta, discovering her omega designation in a biker bar surrounded by alphas isn’t exactly fulfilling any fantasies for Baby. She only wanted to have a fun night, not get knotted, bitten, and bonded. Now, Baby’s entire life is about to turn upside down. With her heat on its way, she needs to find a pack, a nest, and alphas she can trust.</p> <p>The Late Night Howlers have given up hope…after years of waiting for an omega to choose them, this motorcycle club of alphas is ready to move on with their lives. Until one sweet woman takes a chance on them. A rundown bar and apartment building is no place to spoil a new omega, but the Howlers are determined to do right by Baby when she needs them. All they have to do is keep her satisfied while resisting the mouthwatering temptation to bite and bond her, permanently.</p> <p>When a rival MC comes sniffing after Baby, her safety is put at risk, and the Howlers may be torn apart forever.</p>";
