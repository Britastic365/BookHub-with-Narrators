window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Get lost in a world of danger, secrets, and desire in the newest installment of best-selling author Erin Kellison's action-packed Dragons of Bloodfire series. </p><p>Billionaire dragon shifter and Bloodkin Triad member Warrick Voclain is no stranger to power. But when his trusted steward's beautiful granddaughter - all grown up and successful in her own right - seems to be using illegal magic in his presence, he is thrown for a loop. And the fact that she's doing so to protect him? Alarming. </p><p>Samantha Vine needs to stay under the radar, or her secret gift will get her and her granddad killed. She didn't intend for her quick visit home to stretch into weeks in Warrick's company, but anyone striking at Warrick would also hurt her granddad. Only she has the ability to see what's coming, though she'll need Warrick's help to stop it. </p><p>The use of such magic is punishable by death, and Warrick's position on the Triad requires that he adhere to the rule of law. But the attraction between them is electric, stirring his blood and straining his control. </p><p>Adversaries wait in every shadow, and the easiest way to strike down a powerful dragon is to go for the heart, in Warrick's case, Samantha. With fire and blood, he'll reshape the world into one that's safe for her. And those that don't bend to his will? They will burn. </p><p>Photo Credit: bigstock.com </p>";
