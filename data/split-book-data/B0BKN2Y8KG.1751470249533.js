window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>How will the apocalypse end? An amnesiac and a mysterious stranger might herald a new beginning—or the destruction of everything.</i></b></p> <p>I awoke one day on a beach in Northern California with no memory of who I am or how I got here. But a group of refugees from the apocalypse took me in. After two months in the camp they call Sanctuary, I still can't remember anything.</p> <p>Then a man drops out of the sky.</p> <p>Who is Gabriel? Who sent him here? He can be a total jerk, then turn around and save me from certain death. The moment we met, something sparked between us, something hot and undeniable. I don't like him, but I'll need to lay my life in his hands to survive whatever comes next. Gabriel is a warrior, and the only person in either world who has explored the entirety of the Echo.</p> <p>But the mission a mad man started did not die with him. Without its creator, the Echo might destroy both worlds—itself and the Earth. Someone must figure out how to stop it. Someone? Yeah, that's me and my gruff protector. The powerful, intensely sensual connection I share with Gabriel has become our only shot at ending the chaos once and for all.</p> <p>Perfect. Amnesia girl and the beast to the rescue.</p> <p><b><i>Echo Unbound</i></b><b> is the third and final installment in the Echo Power Trilogy of steamy paranormal romances.</b></p>";
