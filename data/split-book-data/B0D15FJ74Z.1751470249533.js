Because I have time for a complication like that in my life.</p> <p>Until an injury sidelines me, making me the center of attention for both men. And as they take turns doting on me, it becomes clear my new Daddies aren't just interested in me, but each other as well. It isn't long before the simmering tension between the three of us boils over into a scorching hot passion.</p> <p>But we have history, mistakes we have to forgive before we can truly become a family. And if we can't, I'm not sure my heart will survive choosing between them...</p>";
