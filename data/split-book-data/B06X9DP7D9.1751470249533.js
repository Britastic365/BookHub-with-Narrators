When a client turns up dead in her club, and she hears the news that the Souljacker - an old tattoo-artist friend-turned-vampire, who was institutionalized years before - has escaped to reclaim his \"artwork\", Lily knows she's next on his list. </p> <p>With one of his tattoos on her thigh and nowhere else to turn, Lily hires Archer Desmond, a chaos demon and PI, to track the vampire down before he tracks her. But she didn't expect to fall for Archer - and they say a succubus who falls in love will destroy the heart of the one she seeks to claim.... </p>";
