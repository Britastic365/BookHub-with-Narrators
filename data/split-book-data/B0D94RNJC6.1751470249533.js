I only had hope for a date for the holidays, but I ended up leaving with a lot more.</p> <p>Holden, Benji, and Grant are everything I was hoping for in a pack. Things happen fast, but they feel right because we're meant to be.</p> <p>But their older brother Phoenix is not very happy about the Omega his brothers bring home. He says he doesn't want an Omega and that his brothers can have me. Only thing is, I'm his scent match, too.</p> <p>You see, I have a little secret I'm not ready to tell my new pack about. I'm a world-famous author, and only a select few know the real identity of the person behind the pen name.</p> <p>Phoenix wants to make a deal with Marie Day to make one of her books into a motion picture. That's not going to happen until he can pull his head out of his ass and give in to the want for me he clearly has. Because I'm a stubborn omega with nothing but time, and I'm not going anywhere.</p>";
