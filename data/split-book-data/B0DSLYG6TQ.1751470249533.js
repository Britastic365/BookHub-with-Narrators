window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>What on earth is a homicide detective supposed to do with two unexpected weeks off?</b></p> <p>While on their first romantic vacation, Detective Isobel \"Bel\" Emerson and Eamon Stone accidentally uncover a black market operation. Agent Jameson Barry and the FBI rush to their aid, but during the raid, Bel finds an inconsequential piece of evidence that the FBI dismisses as trash. Yet she can't get it out of her mind. It lodges in her brain long after she returns home, driving her and her partner, Detective Olivia Gold, to launch an investigation of their own.</p> <p>When evidence uncovered in a disturbing homicide case in Bajka bears striking similarities to the evidence found during the FBI raid, Bel is convinced the two vastly different crimes are somehow related. She throws herself into uncovering the truth as she hunts for the serial killer plaguing Bajka, but when tragedy strikes the small town, the police face a devastating question. Is the truth she's searching for worth the risk, especially when not even Eamon's beast is strong enough to help her?</p> <p><i>Loosely inspired by \"Bluebeard\" and \"The Little Match Girl,\" </i>Criminology of a Character <i>is book four in the Autopsy of a Fairytale series, a crime procedural romantic suspense perfect for those who like dark fairytales, murder mystery, crime procedurals, romance, found family, and a hint of fantasy. Each book will be based on a different fairytale, but Bel (and her Beast) will connect them all, her story ending on small cliffhangers in each book. This series must be listened to in order.</i></p>";
