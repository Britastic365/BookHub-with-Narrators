window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From Lambda Literary Award-winning author Felice Stevens comes a sexy paranormal stand-alone romance.</b></p> <p><b>A vampire who’s lost everything meets a man who has nothing to lose.</b></p> <p>For centuries, Massimo D’Alba, banished prince of the Fold, has wandered through life frozen in darkness and pain. Betrayed by his younger, power-hungry brother, he’s existed for centuries but not lived. A rain-soaked night brings smart-mouthed New Yorker Damion Avery to his doorstep, and suddenly he’s riding spin bikes, shopping for yoga pants, eating ice cream…and falling in love.</p> <p>Damion Avery can’t figure out why Prince Tall, Dark, and Incredibly Sexy wants him as his personal assistant, but he’s not going to second-guess his good luck. Even though he has to work all night and sleep during the day, the job is too good to be true. But where does Massimo sneak off to in the dead of night? Is he a spy, an assassin, or something else? And what’s with those glowing purple eyes? Damion knows he shouldn’t fall for his boss. But Damion was never one to follow the rules. </p> <p>When duty calls him home, Massimo must return to save his kingdom, forcing a life-changing decision: leave Damion behind forever, or reveal his deepest, darkest secret to the man who has become his everything, who owns a part of Massimo he’d thought gone forever…his heart.</p>";
