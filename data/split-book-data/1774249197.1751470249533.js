window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>In the future</i></b><b>: A united Earth, to deal with the problem of population control, divides its population into classes of citizen and non-gratis.</b></p> <p>To be born a non-gratis means a life of little freedoms and the constant possibility of being assigned to work on a colony. Lacking citizenship, every aspect of their life is controlled from where they live down to marriage and childbearing regulations. The only possible escape from life as a non-gratis is to qualify for one of the limited slots available for entrance into the military. For most, however, it is the only life that they will ever know.</p> <p>Charlie has prepared her whole life for the possibility that she could be shipped off to work in a colony, so when she is selected for part of the initialization phase colony laborers, she is determined to make the best out of a new life on a very different and hostile planet. Assigned as a labor assistant in the exploratory lab seems like a step up in the right direction for her. Caring for the wildlife specimens is far preferable to working as a laborer, preparing the first of the fields, or in any of the common industries.</p> <p>That is, until a vaguely humanoid specimen is captured and brought in. The promise of death that clings to it is fulfilled when it breaks out from containment and she finds herself hostage to a being with a thirst for vengeance. Far away from the colony, Charlie is forced to carve out a new life for herself in a dangerous world, but will she be able to safeguard her heart from the biggest threat of them all: a male who is determined to claim all of her.</p> <p><i>This book contains some scenes of graphic violence and sex. </i></p>";
