window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Twenty-two-year-old Ivy Morgan isn't your average college student. She, and others like her, know that humans aren't the only thing trolling the French Quarter for fun... and for food. Her duty to the Order is her life. Four years ago, she lost everything at the hands of the creatures she'd sworn to hunt, tearing her world and her heart apart. </p> <p>Ren Owens is the last person Ivy expected to enter her rigidly controlled life. He's six feet and three inches of temptation and swoon-inducing charm. But letting him in is as dangerous as hunting the cold-blooded killers that are stalking the streets. As Ivy grows closer to Ren, she realizes that she's not the only one who's carrying secrets that could shatter the frail bond between them. She is no longer sure which is more dangerous to her - the ancient beings threatening to take over the town or the man demanding to lay claim to her heart and her soul.</p>";
