window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Genevieve Daylee didn’t expect to be standing in front of a judge on her 27th birthday. But ever since her life became entangled with a former motorcycle gang, she’s learned not to expect anything but trouble.</p> <p>Her mother, a woman she once admired and adored, is gone, leaving behind a trail of secrets and lies. She’s living in a tiny apartment above a garage owned by her brother, a man who loathes her very existence. And the father she met beside her mother’s grave is as much of a stranger as Isaiah Reynolds, the broken man with soulless eyes standing beside her in front of the judge.</p> <p>Isaiah is her protector from the murderer at large in Clifton Forge. Though he’s more like a riven knight in dented armor than a prince on a white stallion. She knows next to nothing about him, other than he works as a mechanic. As of tonight, he’ll be sharing her bathroom.</p> <p>And, according to the judge, Isaiah is now her husband.</p>";
