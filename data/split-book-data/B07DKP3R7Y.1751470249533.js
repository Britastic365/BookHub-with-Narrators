Rejected by her family, Faith crosses the Atlantic, looking for a marriage of convenience and revenge. But things are done differently in London. Werewolves are civilized. At least they pretend to be. </p> <p><b>Americans </b></p> <p>Backward heathens with no culture, Major Channing has never had time for any of them. But there's something special about Faith. Channing finds himself fighting to prove himself and defend his species. But this werewolf has good reason not to trust human women. </p> <p><i>Even if they learn to love, can either of them forgive? </i></p> <p>From the best-selling author of the Parasol Protectorate series. Look out for appearances from favorite characters and the serious consequences of unwarranted geology. </p> <p><i>A Note on Chronology </i></p> <p>The Claw &amp; Courtship novellas can be heard in any order.
