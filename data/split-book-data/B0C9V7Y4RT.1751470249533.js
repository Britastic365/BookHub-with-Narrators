Now she’s got a bunch of irate aliens on her tail, and a hot-as-Helios escaped prisoner in her cargo bay who insists she is his. She’s too old for this crap, and she keeps telling herself she’s too old for him. But his arguments and assets are very convincing.<br> <br> If they’re going to survive this intergalactic crisis, she’s going to need a plan–and her hot, horned, and handsome alien passenger is going to need some clothes.</p> <p>**Buckle up. This sci-fi romance contains an alien with fur, fangs, horns, and a very possessive attitude when it comes to the woman he’s claimed for his own.**</p>";
