Eternally young and full of a brilliant passion that may ultimately be the end of me: my perfect Dorian Gray.</b></p> <p>The painting that’s kept Dorian Gray flawless for over a century is beginning to fall apart, rotted by his life of reckless decadence. Desperate, he seeks out the only person who might be able to save him: a talented young painter descended from Dorian’s first love.</p> <p>Baz may have the same magical gift as her ancestor, but she’s vowed never to paint anyone’s likeness again. Haunted by the memory of the terrible price her talent can exact, she swears she will not be swayed—not even by the seductive words dripping like venom from the lips of the most beautiful man she’s ever met.</p> <p>Yet as Dorian tries to persuade Baz by any means possible, they become aware of a darker, deadlier magic awakening around them. Dangerous forces, long dormant, have been stirred by Baz’s presence…and are determined to have her no matter the cost. As tensions rise and desire flares ever-hotter, Baz and Dorian become trapped in a complex web of conflicting motives, messy emotions, and a growing, desperate passion that may well consume them both.</p> <p><b>An addictive and truly original spicy New Adult retelling of The Picture of Dorian Gray with a magical twist.</b></p> <p><b>GILDED MONSTERS:</b></p> <p>Beautiful Villain (The Great Gatsby): Book 1</p> <p>Charming Devil (The Picture of Dorian Gray): Book 2</p>";
