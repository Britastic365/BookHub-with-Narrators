Staying hidden is simple until the night I beat down the door of the only doctor in town, demanding help, and I meet the woman who changes everything.</p> <p>I’m danger and violence; she’s innocent and caring.

But there’s a sick baby in his arms. He’s not what I expect, throwing my perfectly controlled life into a type of chaos I had no idea I needed. He’s everything I never knew I wanted, making me feel alive with every flaming touch.<br> <br> But when men who look like him come to town wearing leather vests with hate and violence behind their eyes, I have to decide if this new way of living is one I’ll fight for or if I’ll turn my back on the man who showed me how amazing it is to be obsessively loved.<br> <br> ************</p> <p><i>Hidden by the Doctor</i> is dual POV, standalone steamy romantic suspense.
