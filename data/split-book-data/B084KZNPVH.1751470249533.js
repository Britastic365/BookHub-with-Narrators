window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Hidden abilities, haunting memories, and one confused girl. </p> <p>I’m a reaper. Death should come naturally to me, but it doesn’t. And the abilities I am able to conjure are forbidden by my kind. My parents try to hide my abilities, but when the elders assign my first target, they order my parents to stay back. </p> <p>Now I’m on my own, with no one to protect me, no idea what I’m doing, and no control over the powers I’m supposed to keep hidden. </p> <p>I should have known this would blow up in my face. </p> <p>My family name is ruined, and I have to fix what I’ve ripped. I’m not sure I have what it takes. The fate of my entire kind is on my shoulders, and I’m the only one who can make things right. But if I mess up again, it won’t just be my family that I break - our entire world will be ruined. </p> <p>Tomb Raider meets <i>Touched </i>in The Artifact Reaper Saga, a paranormal listen for those who love a dark twist.</p>";
