window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I never believed in fairy-tales. Never held out for Prince Charming.</p> <p>Growing up poor in small-town California as the oldest of six siblings, I knew I would never ride off into the sunset with anyone. That was even more apparent when a senseless tragedy took the lives of my parents, forcing me to become the sole guardian of our dysfunctional household at the mere age of 23.</p> <p>Then a fateful encounter literally brought Prince Charming to my doorstep. At first I thought Viktor was just your average businessman passing through, albeit obscenely handsome, six-foot-five, blue-eyed, and mysteriously rich. But soon I discovered the truth behind Viktor's fa√ßade. Beneath his quiet, enigmatic gaze and cocky charm, is a man who is running away from who he really is. A role he'd rather not fulfill.</p> <p>He is Viktor of House Nordin, His Royal Highness, The Crown Prince of Sweden.</p> <p>Yet uncovering Viktor's secret was only the first step. I didn't expect to fall in love with him. I didn't expect to have my whole life turned upside down. When you're from two different worlds, can your hearts meet somewhere in the middle? Or do happily-ever-afters only exist in fairy-tales?</p> <p><i>Contains mature themes.</i></p>";
