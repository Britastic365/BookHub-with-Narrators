I might be her savior, but I'm no valiant knight. There's only one thing I want in return for helping the girl I found in the wilderness. And that's her. Winter may not remember who she is, but she'll soon realize that the only thing she needs to be is mine. I'm the shadow of two men and the total of none, though she might be what I need to rebuild myself. So once I lay their heads at her feet, I'll cast my tattered soul down with them. And I'll paint her a happily ever after in their blood.</p>";
