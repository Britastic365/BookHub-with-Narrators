His beloved wife passed away five years ago, and their pride and joy, the Happy Valley Bed and Breakfast, has been falling apart ever since. With his daughter getting ready to move away to college, Aiden is finally ready to let go. All he wants to do now is sell the place and move on with his life. There’s just one problem …</p> <p>And her name is Rebah Reynolds.</p> <p>A travel blogger with a drinking problem and a bad attitude to match, Rebah is burned out on her internet-famous lifestyle. For her, travel has lost its allure, and now it’s just a paycheck. In a drunken fury, she gave Aiden’s B&amp;B a disastrous review a few years back. So, the last thing she ever expected was for him to call and request another chance.</p> <p>Struggling to keep up with her younger competition, Rebah agrees and heads out to Napa to craft one of her famously scathing critiques to satisfy her obnoxious followers.
