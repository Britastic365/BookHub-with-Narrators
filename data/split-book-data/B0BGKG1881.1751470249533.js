Well, it’s not really a secret anymore.</b></p> <p>Ophelia was born into a family of Hunters, tasked with protecting the humans from the creatures of the night who feast on their fear.</p> <p>Except Ophelia always found the idea of monsters kind of <i>intriguing</i>. She even made the grave sin of committing some X-rated monster thoughts to paper—which in hindsight may not have been the best idea because her parents were <i>mortified</i>—but you live and learn. </p> <p>Well, everyone finds out your secret, you get banished from society, and then you learn. But the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity Ophelia has been waiting for to make good on some of those fantasies has arrived. The King of Shades requires a hunter bride, and Ophelia is the best fit for the job.</p> <p>Now, she just needs to convince her surly monster husband, Allerick, that she’s the best fit for him.</p> <p><i>Luxuria </i>is a MF standalone arranged marriage romance between a human and her not-quite-human husband. It is intended for mature listeners. </p>";
