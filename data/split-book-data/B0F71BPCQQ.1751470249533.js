window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The Syndicate reigns supreme. I showed our fathers who the real leader of this group was, who could weather any storm.</p> <p>I found Lex, the last of our lost faction, and brought him into the fold to make us whole.</p> <p>Secrets were exposed, lies shattered, and in the end, we defeated our enemies, together.</p> <p>Now, I get to live my life bloody happy with my newfound mates, right? I should’ve known it wasn’t going to be that easy.</p> <p>What happens when you have six headstrong, opinionated, and deadly individuals left to rule the criminal underground? Individuals that have had only months to get used to each other. Could we ever find our true happily ever after?</p> <p>Will we ever tame our crazy dads? What about that promise to birth the next generation of Syndicate leaders? Don’t think I forgot about that little detail…All I know is there’s still a lot for us to do to become unstoppable, but we will, because the Syndicate always prevails.</p> <p>This is a collection of three novellas that continue to follow Rayla and her men. You will get to see some inner workings, backstories, and get a more complete ending to their story. These should be listened to after Syndicate Princess and Syndicate Queen. Make sure to strap in for a ride and watch out for those pesky dad’s and their conniving ways.</p> <p>As always — check TW on my website KiraStanleyAuthor.com</p>";
