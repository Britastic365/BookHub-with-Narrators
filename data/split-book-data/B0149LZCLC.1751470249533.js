window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>For fans of Marie Lu comes the first book in an epic series that bends the sci-fi genre into a new dimension. </b></p> <p><b>“A truly beautiful novel that redefines the form.\" (Victoria Aveyard, best-selling author of </b><b><i>Red Queen</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p>This morning, Kady thought breaking up with Ezra was the hardest thing she'd have to do. </p> <p>This afternoon, her planet was invaded. </p> <p>The year is 2575, and two rival mega-corporations are at war over a planet that's little more than a speck at the edge of the universe. Now, with enemy fire raining down on them, Kady and Ezra - who are barely even talking to each other - are forced to evacuate with a hostile warship in hot pursuit. </p> <p>But their problems are just getting started. A plague has broken out and is mutating with terrifying results; the fleet's AI may actually be their enemy; and nobody in charge will say what's really going on. As Kady hacks into a web of data to find the truth, it's clear only person who can help her is the ex-boyfriend she swore she’d never speak to again. </p> <p>Told through a fascinating dossier of hacked documents - including emails, maps, files, IMs, medical reports, interviews, and more - <i>Illuminae</i> is the first audiobook in a heart-stopping trilogy about lives interrupted, the price of truth, and the courage of everyday heroes. </p> <p>“Prepare yourselves for <i>Illuminae</i>.” (EW.com) </p> <p>“[Y]ou’re not in for an ordinary novel experience....” (Bustle.com)</p> <p>“A truly interactive experience....
