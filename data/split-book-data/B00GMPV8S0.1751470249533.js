window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Kendall Morgan puts her sixth sense back to work in the second audiobook of the Relic Seekers series, divining the history and location of ancient relics. Her boss, gorgeous billionaire Nathan Larraby, sends her to Italy to safeguard a priceless treasure belonging to the Protettori, an ancient order of monks who guard four powerful relics. </p> <p>Nathan believes these may be the cure for his dark curse. He also sends brooding mercenary Jake Stone to watch Kendall’s back - although her back isn’t all Jake has his eye on. </p> <p>Nathan joins them, and all three tumble into a labyrinth of defenses created by the monks to protect their treasures, including the Fountain of Youth. They find themselves in England on the trail of the legendary King Arthur, who along with the Reaper, seems connected to the Protettori. Sparks fly and bonds are tested as Kendall and Nathan’s pasts are revealed and Jake’s becomes even more mysterious. The trio must stay one step ahead of the Reaper if they want to survive. </p>";
