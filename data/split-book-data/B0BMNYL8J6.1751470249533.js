window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After fleeing his hometown of Graylan, Michigan, Rodrick Stone wants nothing more than to forsake his violent past and start over. However, just as circumstances improve, troubling news emerges to beckon him home. Only now, things are different, and not in a good way. What starts as strange dreams and random blackouts quickly spirals into a paranormal world from which his soul has no escapeâ€”and he isn't the only victim. Struggling to make amends with his father while battling demons inside and out, it's up to Rodrick and some unlikely allies to put an end to the evil before they too fall victim to their own nightmares.</p>";
