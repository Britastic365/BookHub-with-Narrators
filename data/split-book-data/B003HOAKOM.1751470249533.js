The reason for this is quite simple. For <i>Shadows Return</i> and <i>The White Road</i>, I had the pleasure of talking in considerable detail with narrator Adam Danoff. So the differences from the first three books may be a bit jarring at first, but what you will hear in <i>Shadows Return</i> and <i>The White Road</i> are the proper pronunciations of names and things, as the author intended. I'm delighted with these new interpretations, and I hope you will be, too. Happy listening! </p> <p>Lynn Flewelling</p>";
