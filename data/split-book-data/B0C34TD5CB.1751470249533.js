window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Angela:</b> I know fear well. It’s had me looking over my shoulder since the day I ran from The Pack, Nevada’s most dangerous werewolf motorcycle gang. I’ve had seven years to build a life and my tattoo parlor with the help of my best artist, Jack. But I’m living on borrowed time. My ex-boyfriend may still be in prison, but that won’t stop him from getting what he wants—our son.</p> <p><b>Jack:</b> I want her, I crave her, but I can never have her. So I wait and watch from the shadows. But when a friend is murdered by the same gang that’s threatening Angela, I vow that they will never touch her. Their blood will be mine first. </p> <p>She’s a wolf backed into a corner. He’s vampire on a tight leash.</p> <p><b>Welcome to Dark Ink Tattoo, where needles aren't the only things that bite.</b></p> <p>Dark Ink Tattoo is a scorching paranormal in the vein of Sons of Anarchy, with strong sexual situations and bisexual MCs.</p>";
