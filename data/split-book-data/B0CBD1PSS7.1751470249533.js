window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From internationally bestselling author Sav R. Miller comes a gritty and steamy romance between a morally gray cybersecurity engineer and his best friend's younger sister.</b></p> <p>Fiona Ivers has been in love with her brother's best friend since she was a kid. He's older and oblivious to her existence, which only makes her want him more. She's always believed he was disinterestedâ€”until a charity gala pushes them together. There, she realizes maybe he pays more attention than he's ever let on.</p> <p>Broody, tattooed loner Boyd Kelly has a low tolerance for distractions and has no issues letting those around him know. His best friend's younger sister doesn't seem to care, though.</p> <p>Each time the high-strung redhead bats her doe eyes in his direction, Boyd gives in a little, secretly desperate for the affection she so clearly wishes to give him.</p> <p>But opening up to love might be more dangerous than either of them knows.</p> <p><i>Sweet Sacrifice </i>is the third interconnected standalone in the King's Trace Antiheroes series, a dark romance trilogy revolving around a corrupt small town in Maine. Listener discretion is advised.</p>";
