The police are sceptical. The mayor won't listen. And Cat's chief suspect is one of the city's most prominent citizens.</p> <p>THE FINAL BODY...MIGHT BE HERS.<br>With the death toll rising, Cat races to expose a deadly conspiracy and the brutal killer at its heart - a killer who will stalk her from the dangerous streets of the inner city to the corridors of power.
