window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Brought to you by Penguin.<br> <br> Over 1 million Discworld audiobooks sold – discover the extraordinary universe of Terry Pratchett’s Discworld like never before</b><br> <br> The audiobook of <i>The Light Fantastic </i>is read by Colin Morgan (<i>Merlin</i>; <i>Testament of Youth</i>;<i> Belfast</i>). BAFTA and Golden Globe award-winning actor Bill Nighy (<i>Love Actually</i>; <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i>; <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i>) reads the footnotes, and Peter Serafinowicz (<i>Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace</i>; <i>Shaun of the Dead</i>) stars as the voice of Death. Featuring a new theme tune composed by James Hannigan.<br> <br> 'Darkness isn't the opposite of light, it is simply its absence . . . what was radiating from the book was the light that lies on the far side of darkness, the light fantastic.'<br> <br> The Discworld is in danger, heading towards a seemingly inevitable collision with a malevolent red star, its magic fading. It needs a hero, and fast.<br> <br> What it doesn't need is Rincewind, an inept and cowardly wizard who is still recovering from the trauma of falling off the edge of the world. Or Twoflower, the well-meaning tourist whose luggage has a mind (and legs) of its own.<br> <br> Which is a shame, because that's all there is . . .<br> <br> <i>The Light Fantastic </i>is the second book in the Wizards series, but you can listen to the Discworld novels in any order.<br> <br> The first book in the Discworld series - <i>The Colour of Magic</i> - was published in 1983. Some elements of the Discworld universe may reflect this.<br> <br> <b>'Incredibly funny, compulsively readable' </b><b><i>The Times</i></b><br> <br> </p>";
