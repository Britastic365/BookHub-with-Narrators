Shen delivers a charged, addictive stand-alone about a tabloid princess who is desperate to self-destruct...and the grumpy bodyguard who saves her.</b></p> <p>I landed in hot water with the tabloids one too many times. What can I say? My nipple wanted to come out and say hi to the paparazzi.</p> <p>After that, my father presented me with an ultimatum—either he cuts off the gravy train and stops paying for my lavish lifestyle or I agree to have a live-in bodyguard.</p> <p>And by bodyguard, I mean a sexy, formidable, out-of-this-world babysitter who just happens to be good at breaking spines.</p> <p>Ransom Lockwood, ladies and gentlemen.</p> <p>Now he is forcing me to try all kinds of weird stuff. Stop partying, clean up my act, get a job....</p> <p>A part of me wants to tell him to get lost. I’m past saving.</p> <p>But the other part? The other part wants to save <i>him</i>.</p>";
