And I didn’t come back to this city for a boy who forgot about me when I was kidnapped. Matthew Caldwell broke his promises to me. And I broke every single promise I made him. But he helped heal my heart once before. And I think maybe he’s the only one who can help me now.</p> <p><b>Matt</b></p> <p>It’s easiest to remember Brooklyn in the fall. The autumn leaves, the crisp smell of the air—it’s all her. I wasted half my life loving someone who’s never coming back. And I still want all the things I once did—kids, a wife, a home. But how can I move forward if I still feel her presence at every turn? It’s almost like she’s still here with me…</p>";
