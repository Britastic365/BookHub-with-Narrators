Protecting my sister and my niece or nephew is more important than basketball.</p> <p>Making sure the man who was behind trying to end me is ended is more important. With mentors like Capone and Cappadonna behind me, I can't lose.</p> <p>My head is in the game. I'm focused, and I want revenge. I refuse to sit down until someone's blood is on my hands for taking Joie and our child away from me. I refuse to lose, and I'm making sure my family is protected by any means necessary.</p> <p>It's funny how I used to be against the streets, and I still am. However, if I'm going to marry Capone and into the Delgato family, those views need to change. I need to ride for my future husband like I know he would ride for me. It's time for me to put all my fears and reservations behind me and stand beside Capone.</p> <p>We are a target. People want to bring harm to our front step, and it's time to stand beside my husband and protect our family.</p> <p>My only rule is that Capone has to always make it home to us.</p>";
