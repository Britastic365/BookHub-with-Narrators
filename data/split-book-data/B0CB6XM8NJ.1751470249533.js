Now, free of the bloodstained work, he’s ready to rekindle what he’s lost. But in England, he meets someone who is also blond, blue-eyed, and irresistible. Problem is, Griffith Elswood is Charlotte’s brother. Should Mark even consider putting his hands all over an innocent who would push him away if he knew what kind of monster Mark is?</p> <p>After years of homeschooling, Griffith wants nothing more than to finally spread his wings at university.
