And I knew I’d have to save him—because how else does the girl nobody wants win over the boy beloved by all?</p> <p>Nothing about his life or mine has gone to plan. He’s isolated and miserable. I’ve got a vindictive ex, two young kids, and more problems than I can count.</p> <p>But what hasn’t changed is this: It still feels like he’s mine. And it sure looks like he’s in need of saving.</p> <p><b>Caleb</b></p> <p>My life is a prison sentence. I came to the lake to serve it alone...but Lucie’s throwing a wrench in my plans.</p> <p>Lucie—the little kid shut away each summer in the house next door. Now she’s grown—and God, did she <i>ever</i> grow up—and I can’t seem to escape her.</p> <p>Everywhere I look, she’s there. Reminding me of all the things I used to want, used to dream about.... And making me want every last one of them again.</p>";
