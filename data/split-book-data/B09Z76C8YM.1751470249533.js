window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>There’s a thin line between love and hate. </b></p> <p>Kyra Kado hates Van Hernandez. Or at least she wishes she could. Ever since she kissed him and he rejected her as a “mistake”, things have been tense onboard their tour bus. Kyra takes out her aggression during her drumming performances as a member of Kason Cox’s band and tries not to think about how well Van guards her body between their shows. </p> <p>Until she meets Ollie Dawes, who’s the perfect distraction. Funny, flirty, and cute AF, he takes her mind off Van. The Hot Rides salvage man is used to being alone on his solo part-finding missions, but she suspects he’d rather not be lonely anymore. She can relate. So she invites him to come see a show. </p> <p>When Van discovers Kyra and Ollie performing an illicit encore together, he goes berserk. Distancing herself from Van might keep Kyra’s heart safe, but what about her body? A string of unsettling incidents make Kyra afraid one of her admirers has crossed the line from fan to fanatic. </p> <p>With Ollie and Van teamed up to protect Kyra, she isn’t sure she’ll survive being torn between the two men she craves. She might have to sacrifice her friendships with them to stay sane, unless she can think of a way to keep them both in her life or in her bed. </p> <p><b>This is a stand-alone book in the Hot Rides series and includes an HEA with no cheating. The series is part of the greater universe where both the Powertools and Hot Rods books are also set, so you can visit with many of your previous favorite characters and see what they’re up to now!</b></p>";
