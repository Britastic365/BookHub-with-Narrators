window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>She's a rule follower. He's a man who could ruin her reputation.</b></p> <p>Lila Callaghan has two big problems. She's been caught in an act of revenge she isn't proud of, and the man she's been avoiding for two years is the one who saw everything.</p> <p>Reed Abner is more than a hotshot professor at Lila's University. He's a family friend, and Lila is only too happy to pretend he never saw her slash her cheating ex-boyfriend's tire. Before this colossal lapse in judgment, Lila didn't want to be associated with Reed at all, in fact, at the risk of other students and faculty thinking the popular professor was playing favorites.</p> <p>Avoiding Reed is easy enough… until it isn't. When Lila is suddenly desperate for an internship, he offers her a dream opportunity at the youth center he coordinates. This close to finishing her Master's degree, she'd be foolish to turn it down. The only issue? Reed's her supervisor.</p> <p>Working in such close proximity to each other poses an even bigger problem. Reed proves to be an excellent mentor, but he's awakened feelings in Lila she shouldn't have.</p> <p>Reed is her superior. He's twelve years her senior. And as the burning desire between them grows, Lila wonders if falling for him will be her worst mistake yet.</p>";
