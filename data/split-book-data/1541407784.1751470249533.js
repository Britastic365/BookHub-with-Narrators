A primal magic that threatens to destroy them all.... </p> <p>Sophie has done her best to avoid the magical world for fear of the havoc her abnormal ability wreaks on other supernaturals. As a silencer who mutes the powers of those around her, she's spent her life among the mortals her defect can't harm. </p> <p>But when Mother Nature pushes her from her home to do her bidding, Sophie has no choice but to venture to the magical town of Twin Rivers. </p> <p>Instead of viewing her presence as a curse, four men see Sophie's arrival as a blessing. Carrigan, a psychic who hears everyone's thoughts at all times. Hagan, a bear shifter who transforms at the slightest provocation. Jonas, whose losses have left him isolated and jaded. And Valor, a vampire without conscience or remorse. </p> <p>Drawn to Sophie, these irresistible men find themselves caught up in a dangerous whirlwind of magic that runs deeper than they can imagine. But Sophie can't allow her mounting attraction to keep her from her mission - because Mother's wrath destroys everything it touches. </p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
