But the power vacuum they have created is begging to be filled, and the three houses of Ediria are at each other's throats, trying to claim it. Worse, the threat from the shadow creatures is far from endedâ€”an even more diabolical villain has risen in Aolis's place, and she will stop at nothing in her plot to throw Ediria into chaos and drown the kingdom in its own blood.</p> <p>If Adara is to make things right, she must complete the coming-of-age ritual to unlock her powers so she can defeat the shadow creatures once and for all. But who can she rely on when everyone seeks to use her as a pawn in their nefarious games? Even Einar seems to have his own agenda, and when it comes to matters of the heart, no one can be trusted....</p>";
