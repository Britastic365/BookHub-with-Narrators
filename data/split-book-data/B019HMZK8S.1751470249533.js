So when her friends can't continue on a long-anticipated hike through Yellowstone National Park, she goes on without them. But Marlee isn't alone in the woods: She is being hunted by a pack of frighteningly intelligent wolves. When a fight for survival takes an impossible turn, Marlee realizes that the enigmatic stranger who saves her might be her dream come true - or her waking nightmare. </p> <p>Big, bad wolf... </p> <p>As the pack's enforcer, Daniel has sworn to keep the existence of werewolves a secret.
