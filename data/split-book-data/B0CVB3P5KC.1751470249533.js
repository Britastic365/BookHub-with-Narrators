window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A Seductive and Suspenseful Vampire Saga...</p> <p>After 130+ years as a vampire, Mercy returns to her hometown of Exeter where she joins Prince Ladinas and his team of underground vampires to stop a host of ancient vampires who've returned from vampire hell.</p> <p>Book 1: Bloody Queen:</p> <p>Hell hath no fury like a witch-turned-vampire scorned...</p> <p>My long-dead vampire brother has returned from hell. He's challenged my right to the vampire throne. He brought a hellhound with him.</p> <p>Every time hellbeast kills, the bastard gets stronger. He's unstoppable. Stronger and faster than any vampire I've ever encountered.</p> <p>Have I finally met my match?</p> <p>On top of that, my ex-vampire lover is on a tear.</p> <p>I need to rally every vampire I can find. I've teamed up with Prince Ladinas and the Vampire Underground. These vampires aren't much for the democratic processes of the Vampire Council. They need a bloody queenâ€”and I'm just the bitch for the job.</p> <p>ALSO INCLUDED:</p> <p>Bloody Underground (#2): At least they had trials in Salem...</p> <p>Bloody Retribution (#3): It's time to settle an ancient score...</p> <p>Bloody Bastards (#4): Faerie gangs are at war...</p> <p>Bloody Brilliance (#5): I'm done being the good girl...</p> <p>You've met Mercy before in The Legacy of a Vampire Witch and The Blood Witch Saga. She's fought against devils and demons, insidious witches, and old-world vampires. When she returns to Exeter, where she grew up as a girl, she'll find enemies even bigger and badder than anything she's ever faced before.</p> <p>A great series for fans of Anne Rice, Bella Forrest, or Stephenie Meyer to sink their fangs into. The Fury of a Vampire Witch features a dark and twisty romance, action that could even get a vampire's heart pumping, and a snarky badass heroine.</p>";
