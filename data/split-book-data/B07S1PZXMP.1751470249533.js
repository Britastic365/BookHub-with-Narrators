window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A <i>USA Today</i> best-selling novel.</p> <p>Years ago, we were in love. She was an up-and-coming superstar and I was the security professional hired to keep her safe. We fell hard and fast, no matter how much we tried to resist one another. But not everyone around us was happy about our relationship, and a string of lies and deceit destroyed what we once had. I moved on from her and didn't look back.</p> <p>Now, I've taken the helm of a nationally renowned protective services company, and I'm looking to rebrand my career. The newly crowned Jameson force security is moving from the glitz and glamour of Las Vegas to the mountainous steel town of Pittsburgh, and the last thing I have time for is to deal with my past.</p> <p>More than a decade has passed since our split, but even a bruised and battered heart remembers its first love. So when Joslyn Meyers comes to me for help, I reluctantly agree to keep her safe from a terrifying stalker who keeps threatening her life.</p> <p>As the danger continues to intensify, it becomes clear that I'll stop at nothing to protect the woman who turned her back on me all those years ago. Because one thing is certain - no matter how hard I try to convince myself otherwise, Joslyn still has my heart.</p>";
