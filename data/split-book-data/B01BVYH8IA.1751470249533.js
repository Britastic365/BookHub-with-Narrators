window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The town of Willow Creek is seemingly free after Remy's sacrifice set off a life-altering chain of events that resulted in the demise of most of the world's vampire population. Sabine flees to her home afterward, except her family has disappeared and a \"For Sale\" sign is planted in her front yard. Just when she thinks she's lost it all, she's summoned back to Willow Creek Manor. Confused, and almost certainly walking into a trap, she reluctantly returns, only to find that the king of vampires still lives; and he is none other than her Remy. The dead love of her life is alive, but he doesn't quite seem like the same man. With the help of a witch, a ghost, and a longtime enemy, can Sabine bring back the man she fell in love with or will she lose him forever? </p>";
