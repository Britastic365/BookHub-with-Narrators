window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p></p>It's not easy finding love when you're nine hundred years old . . . And undead <p></p> <p>Romance novelist Christian Dante is sexy and arrogant, a true alpha male. He's also a Dark One (aka vampire), doomed to spend eternity cruising the singles scene in search of the one woman who can redeem his soul. But finally he's found the love that Fate has chosen for him. Too bad she sees dead people and likes to play with demons. </p> <p>Allie Telford is a Summoner - and she needs to rustle up a ghost pretty darn quick or her paranormal career will be over. Luckily, she's just stumbled upon a naked and unquestionably hot specter in a haunted hotel . . . who looks disturbingly like the tall, dark, handsome fantasy man who's been coming to Allie in her dreams. But it seems he's no phantom after all - he's a real flesh-and-blood- fed immortal who's determined to make Allie his lover for forever . . . or longer. </p> <p>Which may not be a totally bad thing . . .</p>";
