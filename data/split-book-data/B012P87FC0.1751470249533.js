window.bookSummaryJSON = "<ul> <li>Learn the breakthrough secrets of having the sexy body you want </li> <li>Build your confidence </li> <li>Control your mind and emotions </li> <li>Healthy eating </li> <li>Weight loss </li> <li>Tips for staying active </li> <li>And so much more! </li> </ul> <p>The main component to being awesome and feeling sexy is confidence. Yes, being healthy (mentally and physically) is also an important aspect, as are self-respect and self-assurance. However, if you don't feel confident, you will always be missing a key ingredient. Mind you, being confident and being full of yourself are two very different things. </p> <p>In this book you will find various elements that are necessary in order for you to obtain that sexy body you've always wanted. </p> <p>In the first chapter, we will cover confidence and how you can build yours up. It will also cover the difference between arrogance and confidence, how to build your self-esteem, and how to boost your self-assurance for those rough times when you'll need it the most. </p> <p>In the second chapter, we will cover more about your mind. Your mental health is often just as important (if not more) as your physical health. It is a shame that most of us forget about that. You need to exercise your mind and your brain just like you exercise your body for optimum health. I'll go over how you can control your mind and emotions so that you can make this journey more fun and easy. </p> <p>Then we'll go over the best plan for weight loss. That weight loss plan is called eating healthy. Yes, it sounds boring, and, to some of you, it might sound hard and unappealing. However, this eating plan (let's stay away from the dirty <i>d</i> word, shall we?) is the best one to help you lose weight and keep it off, and it allows you to have cake every now and then. Come on. It doesn't sound half bad, now, does it? </p>";
