window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Can Evie convince her rival loves to work together? Their survival depends on it in this third book of number one <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Kresley Cole's Arcana Chronicles, a nonstop action tale of rescue, redemption, and a revenge most wicked. </p> <p><i>Heartbreaking decisions</i>: Evie was almost seduced by the life of comfort that Death offered her - until Jack was threatened by two of the most horrific Arcana, The Lovers. She will do anything to save him, even escape Death's uncanny prison, full of beautiful objects, material comforts... and stolen glances from a former love. </p> <p><i>Uncertain victory</i>: Despite leaving a part of her heart behind with Death, Evie sets out into a frozen and perilous post-apocalyptic wasteland to meet up with her allies and launch an attack on The Lovers and the vast army they command. Such formidable enemies require a battle plan, and the only way to kill them once and for all may mean Evie, Jack, and Death allying. Evie doesn't know what will prove more impossible: surviving slavers, plague, Bagmen and other Arcana - or convincing Jack and Death to work together. </p> <p><i>Two heroes returned</i>: There's a thin line between love and hate, and Evie just doesnâ€™t know where she stands with either Jack or Death. Will this unlikely trio be able to defeat The Lovers without killing one another first?</p>";
