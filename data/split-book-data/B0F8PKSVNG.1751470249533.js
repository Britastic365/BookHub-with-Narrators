window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From </b><b><i>USA Today</i></b><b> bestselling author Layla Frost comes the final book in this twisty urban fantasy romance series about fated mates, evil soul-stealers, and love so beautiful, it must be magicks.</b></p> <p>The battle was fought. And the battle was lost.</p> <p>Waking up in the middle of nowhere, my connection to my siblings was gone. Jaggedly severed like a stolen soul.</p> <p>I searched for centuries. Living under countless names. In countless places. Never getting close to anyone. Never staying long enough for anyone to notice I didn't age.</p> <p>I gave up on finding them. I gave up on finding the other half of my soul. I gave up… period.</p> <p>Until the day I felt Aurora. My one.</p> <p>I didn't know how the golden-haired beauty ended up in the woods near my cabin. What she'd been through. Why a hollow pain—the kind that could take a grown man to his damned knees—filled her. Or why finding out she was my soulmate made her burst into tears.</p> <p>I would gladly let the world burn to give her happiness, but letting her go was never an option. It had nothing to do with fate and everything to do with her being mine.</p> <p>It was no coincidence that I found Aurora and my siblings at the same time. Evil lurked closer. Bigger and badder than we ever expected. Heaven, Hell, and everything in between were in danger.</p> <p>I felt it in my bones.</p> <p><i>This completed steamy romantasy series is made to be enjoyed in order. If you try to jump in at book four, you'll be as lost as Juno in a corn maze after a handful of her special gummy bears. Start back at </i>Styx <i>and enjoy the magicks from the beginning.</i></p> <p><i>Contains mature content. A complete list of content warnings can be found on the author's website.</i></p>";
