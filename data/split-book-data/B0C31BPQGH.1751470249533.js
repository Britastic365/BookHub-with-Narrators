window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Opposites attract in this modern-day fairytale when American, Sophie MacKnight, inherits a Scottish castle along with a hot grumpy Scotsman who is tasked with training her to be a magickal knight before the Kelpies wreak havoc on the people of Loren Brae.</p> <p>The knight was supposed to be a man. Not me, Sophie MacKnight, a marketing associate from California. This must be a practical joke that the Scots play on visiting Americans. Because otherwise I’ve inherited a haunted castle in Scotland, along with one irritatingly sexy Scotsman, who would be delighted if I turned tail and ran.</p> <p>Frankly, I thought I would fly here, sell the heap of bricks, and head back home to a life that I…well, I was comfortable with at the very least. Instead, the people of Loren Brae are in trouble, and it appears that as the new owner of the castle, I’m next in line to reinstate the magickal Order of Caledonia.</p> <p>Which means, first, I have to learn to believe in magick. And secondly, I have to train to become a knight.</p> <p>And my trainer? None other than Lachlan Campbell, the grumpiest man I’ve ever had the annoyance of meeting. It’s a toss-up who is pricklier, Lachlan, or his kilted Chihuahua, Sir Buster. Not only does Lachlan think that I can’t hack it, but he also resents my claim on his castle. If only he didn’t look so devastatingly hot in his kilt.</p> <p>Now, I’m stuck proving myself to him, all while trying to figure out how to help my new friends in Loren Brae.</p> <p>Sparks fly as our swords meet, and we battle our rising attraction for each other. Who will win in this (Highland) game of love?</p>";
