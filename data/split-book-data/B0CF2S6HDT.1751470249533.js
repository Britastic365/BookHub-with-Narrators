Nice cars, fancy clothes, impeccable manners. She’s got more money than she knows what to do with. </p> <p>When someone steals one of Sophie’s most beloved possessions, she hires the very best to investigate and get it back for her.</p> <p>Working as a private investigator for years, Jax Turner has come into contact with a variety of clients. But there’s never been anybody like Sophie. As much as he wants to whisk her away to his bed, he knows she’s way out of his league.</p> <p>But if Jax can get to the bottom of this case and find Sophie’s stolen item, maybe he’ll be able to dazzle her with his mind. </p> <p>Because a woman with that much money would never give him a second glance, otherwise. </p> <p>But that’s where he’s mistaken. </p> <p>Sophie’s not the woman everyone thinks she is. She just needs Jax to give her the chance to prove it.</p>";
