But Blaise Mackenzie has never, not ever, been one to give up without a fight. </p> <p>Her military career might be over, but her career as a prison guard is just about to get started. </p> <p>And her favorite prisoner? A pissed-off older man, a drill sergeant dishonorably discharged from the Army that tells himself daily that the new ‘Kitty Kitty’ female prison guard is not for him. </p> <p>After following him around for years, watching over him from afar in any way she can, Sin is released early. And the first person that he’s going to see? A stubborn little blonde-headed female that should’ve known better than to trust a man like him.</p>";
