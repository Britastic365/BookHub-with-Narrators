Their marriage is a sham, built on a foundation of murder, lies, and deceit. They're broken. Destroyed. Yet, even after hearing her confession, Ryker cannot leave Brynleigh in the pit.</p> <p>In an act of foolish love, he makes a deal to set Brynleigh free. All she has to do is go back to her maker and find evidence that Jelisette de la Point is a traitor.</p> <p>That's easier said than done, but Brynleigh is left with no choice. She can either accept the deal or rot behind bars. Worse than all that is her relationship with Ryker.</p> <p>Once, she thought they'd get a happy ending. Now, an ocean divides them.</p> <p>She broke the rules and fell in love, but is love powerful enough to save them?</p> <p><i>This is the second half of Ryker and Brynleigh's duet and should be listened to after</i> A Game of Love and Betrayal.</p>";
