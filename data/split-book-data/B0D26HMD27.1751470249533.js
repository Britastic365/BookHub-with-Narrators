All she knows is that her mothers up to something. Nothing new there. Her mother has been trying to dictate Ephie's life since the day she was born. So when an old boyfriend suddenly appears and tells Ephie about the cool little town he lives in, Ephie jumps on the chance to take a trip, not realizing she's doing exactly what her mother wants. Or what kind of trouble is headed her way.<br> <br> Remy Lafitte wasn't supposed to be in New Orleans. He was only there to see a sick friend, but then the mother of a former girlfriend finds him and asks for his help. He cant refuse, and not just because her mother is threatening him. If Ephelia's in danger, Remy will do anything he can to protect her (and her cat). She was, after all, the only woman he's ever loved.<br> <br> Ephie and Remy have a lot of catching up to do, but they may not get the chance when a real threat comes to Nocturne Falls. Suddenly, Ephie's life hangs in the balance and Remy must make a decision. Even if it means breaking his own heart again.</p>";
