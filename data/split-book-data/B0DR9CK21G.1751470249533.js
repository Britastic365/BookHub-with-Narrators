window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Performed with duet narration by Vanessa Edwin and Robert Hatchet!</p> <p>My plan when I win a date in Vegas with my brother’s hockey star best friend? Poker and go to sleep early. Instead, I wake up with a ring on my finger and the sexy athlete naked in my bed.</p> <p>But Asher’s my best friend too so we’ll get this annulled and laugh about this secret for years to come.</p> <p>Trouble is our wedding pics went viral overnight.</p> <p>Now everyone thinks we’re a real couple. We race back home, where I’ve just landed the big art commission of my dreams and he’s launching a sports charity so we need to look like we meant to tie the knot.</p> <p>Easy enough. We’ll claim we’ve been secretly in love, while staying in separate rooms for the rest of the hockey season.</p> <p>The last thing either one of us wants is to ruin a decade-long friendship by falling into bed again.</p> <p>But I experience a new side of my husband at home. He cooks for me, encourages me…and buys me so many toys.</p> <p>And, it’s more fun to share your toys with a friend.</p> <p>We’re just enjoying temporary marital benefits.</p> <p>Except, the more times he calls me his wife, the more I start to wonder if Asher was ever pretending?</p> <p>And if my heart is ready to take the biggest risk of all.</p> <p>Tropes: brother’s best friend, friends to lovers, marriage of convenience, marriage pact, he’s been secretly in love with her for years, forced proximity, my wife, pro hockey</p>";
