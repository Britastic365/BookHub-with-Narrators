window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Keeping Beth by my side is turning out to be far harder than I planned. After all, I couldn’t escape her when we were traveling with Leander and Taylor. She dogged my steps, flitted through my dreams, and took up all my waking thoughts. </p> <p>Now? </p> <p>She’s disappeared like smoke through my fingers. But I will always find her. Nothing can keep me from the one my soul is tethered to, not even this pit of a city, Cranthum. The slavers control everything, and they’re on the verge of the biggest market of the year: the Bazaar. </p> <p>With Beth at my side - along with a few more surprising allies - we will light a spark that will change Cranthum and the summer realm, forever. But freedom always comes at a cost, and the price is often paid in blood.</p>";
