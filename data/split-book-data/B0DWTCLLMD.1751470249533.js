Now, Willa and the Abcurses are determined to strip back the layers, to uncover the truth, and to understand the true nature of the two worlds before it's too late. The only problem?</p> <p>Any wrong step in their quest to restore balance might have terrible repercussions. Every single being—living or dead—might have to pay the price.</p> <p>This is a full novel, 90,000 words. Book 5 of 5 in the Curse of the Gods Series</p>";
