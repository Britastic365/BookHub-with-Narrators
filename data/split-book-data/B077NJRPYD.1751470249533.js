Winter elf, Jack Frost's daughter, Santa Claus' niece, heir to the Winter Throne and now...private investigator.

Unfortunately, that doesn’t stop Spider from getting into trouble.It takes the help of a gentlemen friend (and a few others) for Birdie to make things right again. But not before her love life takes a very interesting turn....</p>";
