window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Check in to County Hospital’s secret ward - where paranormal activities lead to medical emergencies for one tireless nurse. </p> <p>After surviving a brutal vampire attack, nurse Edie Spence is ready to get back to work attending to supernatural creatures in need of medical help. But her nursing skills are put to the test when she witnesses a hit-and-run on her lunch break. The injured pedestrian is not only a werewolf, he’s a pack leader, and now Edie’s stuck in the middle of an all-out were-war. </p> <p>With two rival packs fighting tooth and nail, Edie has no intention of crossing enemy lines. But when she meets her patient’s nephew - a tattooed werewolf named Lucas with a predatory gleam in his eye that’s hard to resist - Edie can’t help but choose sides. The question is, can she trust this dangerous new ally? And can she trust her own instincts when she’s near him? Edie can’t seem to pull away - even if getting involved makes her easy prey. </p> <p>In addition to being a writer, Cassie Alexander is an active registered nurse in California. She is the author of the Edie Spence series.</p>";
