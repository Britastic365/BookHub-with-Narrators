window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Forest trails, cactus flails, and little skunk tails, that's where I get my magic...</b></p> <p>\"Surprise, you're a witch.\" That's not exactly what I expected when I inherited a cozy little cottage in the woods. Nor to have a cactus as my new door guard or a skunk as my familiar! Still, this whole magic thing is growing on me.</p> <p>The pair of hot boyfriends certainly helps make it easier to accept the insanity. But after dealing a serious blow to the coven of wixen who planned to enslave me, I'm kinda screwed. I may have won that battle, but I learned I do not know enough to stop the upcoming war—and a skunk can only teach me so much.</p> <p>What I need is a little help here! Yet when it's offered by the bad boy of the coven, I'm not sure I can trust it. Never mind that he's my boyfriend's ex! Things are starting to get complicated, and I still can't find the lost wild things. If those die, magic will be lost forever!</p> <p>How can I save them if I don't even know where they're being held? Worse, how can I do this? I still don't know what I'm doing! Or maybe I should just let the magic die? That might be the only way to end this once and for all.</p> <p><i>If you like found families, swoony romance, and paranormal problems, you'll love this captivating tale. </i>Spells In The Summertime <i>is the second book in the Where The Wild Things Grow series, set in the larger Moonlight Universe.</i></p>";
