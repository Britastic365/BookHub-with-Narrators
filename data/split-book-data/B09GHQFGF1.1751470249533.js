Being traded to Dallas was not what I was expecting, but neither were the divorce papers I was served.

Over time, our work relationship changed, and we grew closer, leaning on each other for support. He was my rock, my best friend. Then one drunken night changed everything, and I saw what was in front of me all along. I just hope that, when the dust settles, we won’t regret it.</p>";
