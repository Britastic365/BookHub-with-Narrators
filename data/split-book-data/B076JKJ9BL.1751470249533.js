window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>He's on the vacation from hell. She's on her honeymoon with a husband who isn't what he seems. They're both in the wacky world of <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Katie MacAlister's paranormal Otherworld. </p><p>On his first day of vacation, Jim ended up naked, alone, and banished to limbo. Things went downhill from there. </p><p>In a wild ride through Finland with very non-Shakespearean Titania, double-dealing Oberon, and a plethora of militant nymphs bent on revenge, \"The Perils of Effrijim\" is loaded with quirky characters, a fast-paced story, and an adorable demon who just wants to be with his beloved. </p><p>In \"Cat Got Your Tongue\", Joy Randall thought her honeymoon with husband Raphael was going to fulfill all her expectations, but almost immediately they run into a decades-old curse, a spurned ghostly first wife, and a long-dead randy Scottish Laird. As if the odd inhabitants of their castle wasn't enough, Joy finds she isn't going to get the honeymoon she deserves until she settles an ancient feud...which uncovers some pretty shocking secrets about her new husband. </p><p>This collection of two short stories and assorted mini/short pieces were published previously, and gathered here for the first time. <i>The Perils of Effrijim and Other Stories</i> also includes excerpts of the two books that launched the characters in the stories: <i>You Slay Me</i> and <i>A Girl's Guide to Vampires</i>. </p>";
