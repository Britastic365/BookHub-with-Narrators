window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Redwood Pack Book 4.6</i> </p> <p>Adam Jamenson's courtship of his mate wasn't the most conventional. In fact, it didn't exist. Though he knows Bay loves him with every ounce of her soul, he needs to prove to her that he's worth it. Not only for her, but for himself. While they move on and learn to be the Enforcer mated pair, Bay will find herself on a path that leads her to a history beyond just her and Adam's mating. When she finds a locket rich in history and memories, she'll do all in her power to see those involved found and remembered. With Adam by her side, they'll both find the true meaning of forgiveness. </p> <p>Author's Note: This is a novella set between books 4 and 5 to give you a taste of Bay and Adam.
