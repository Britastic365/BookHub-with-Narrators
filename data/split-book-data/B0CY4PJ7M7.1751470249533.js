The scroll does not simply exist—it calls, it tempts, and it corrupts. With her team, Brent Cole, Kingsley Fulcrum, and Detective Sherbet, Sam must navigate treacherous alliances, battle-driven factions, and a past that refuses to stay buried.</p><p>But power of this magnitude comes at a cost. As the scroll tightens its grip, it forces her to confront a chilling reality. Whoever possesses the scroll holds the fate of all supernatural life. The consequence of that responsibility threatens to consume her, turning friend against friend.</p><p>With time running out and danger closing in, Sam must make an unthinkable choice: protect the scroll, destroy it, or surrender to the force that threatens to unravel her very soul. As the battle lines are drawn and betrayals unfold, the only certainty is that no one will emerge unscathed.</p><p>In this thrilling conclusion to April M. Reign’s non-canon series, Samantha Moon must decide not only the fate of the supernatural world but her own path forward.
