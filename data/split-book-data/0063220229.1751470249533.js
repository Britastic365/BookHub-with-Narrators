But he could never have imagined that the servant girl with the strange eyes, the girl he can’t put out of his mind, would one day soon uproot his kingdom—and the world.</p> <p>Perfect for fans of <b>Sarah J. Maas</b>, <b>Leigh Bardugo</b>, and <b>Sabaa Tahir</b>, this is the explosive first book in a new romantasy series from the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling and National Book Award–nominated author Tahereh Mafi.</p> <p><b>“In a tale as exquisitely crafted as one of Alizeh’s own garments, Mafi weaves a spell of destiny and danger, forbidden love and courtly intrigue, magic and revolution.” —Cassandra Clare, #1 </b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>bestselling author of </b><b><i>The Last Hours</i></b></p> <p><b>“</b><b><i>This Woven Kingdom</i></b><b> is an exquisite fantasy.
