window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>My husband is cruel, ruthless, and despicable.</p> <p>I hate him with every fiber of my being.</p> <p>The only reason I haven't killed him or tried to run away is because of the promise I made. I sold myself to save someone I loved...and this is the price I have to pay.</p> <p>I was sitting alone in a bar when the most handsome man walked inside. Striking blue eyes, cheekbones as sharp as glass, and a muscular body fit for a war. He was gorgeous. I couldn't take my eyes off him. When he bought me a drink, I didn't say no. I'd been unfulfilled for so long, and I wanted a real man for the night. My husband had his affairs so why couldn't I?</p> <p>I noticed the peculiar ring on his right hand, a diamond carved into a skull. If only I'd known what that meant, I would have known who this man was.</p> <p>The Skull King.</p> <p>A man more cruel and ruthless than my own husband.</p>";
