After a stunningly sensual night together, Maggie is prepared for the two of them to go their separate ways. After all, she's not a happily-ever-after kind of girl. But Josiah - and danger - change her plans. </p> <p>Josiah isn't looking for love...but Maggie rouses his body and stirs his heart like no other woman. She's got a rocky romantic past, and a smart man would steer clear. But when the murder quotient in Kendall County rises and all signs point to a mysterious group nearby who have been harassing Maggie's family, he can't leave her unprotected - especially when he realizes he's fallen hard for her. </p> <p>As tension mounts and the menace closes in, Josiah will do anything to prove to Maggie that their love is real...but can they stay alive long enough to share it? </p> <p><b><i>Contains mature themes.</i></b></p>";
