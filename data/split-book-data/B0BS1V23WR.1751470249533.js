window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Devoted. Loyal. Shameless. The Boys of Clermont Bay had been my protectors for as long as I could remember.</b></p> <p>And Olly Warner took the job to heart. He was intense and all-consuming, and I had been in love with him for years. Alarmingly handsome and recklessly charming, he attempted to deny there was ever anything between us.</p> <p>But we slipped over that invisible line, and the moment we gave in, something fractured. He was leaving regardless, and I couldn’t hang on tight enough for the both of us. Olly had always been the boy I could never have, but I couldn’t help losing myself in him.</p> <p>A searing affair, the guarantee of a broken heart, and the desperation of careless promises. Olly and I were never meant to be, and we had become nothing more than a pretty lie.</p>";
