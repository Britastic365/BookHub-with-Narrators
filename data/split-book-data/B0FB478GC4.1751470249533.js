window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the moment my twin sister set her eyes on Matteo, she decided he was the one. We were just kids, but that didn’t matter to her. In her heart, she believed they were destined to be together.</p> <p>So when their arranged engagement was announced, no one was surprised.</p> <p>At least, that’s what I thought.</p> <p>But lately, something had felt off. Wherever I went, Matteo was there. Lurking in the dark, concealed in the shadows, always watching.</p> <p>I didn’t know what I’d done to capture his attention. I didn’t want it. Yet, I couldn’t stop my heart from trembling like a bare soul caught in the icy grip of winter whenever he came near. Nor could I ignore my body’s traitorous response to his voice, low and laced with wicked intent.</p> <p>I fought to resist him. I truly did. But it was useless.</p> <p>He knew it. And so did I.</p> <p>So I ran.</p> <p>But that was the thing about the Vitales: they always gave chase.</p>";
