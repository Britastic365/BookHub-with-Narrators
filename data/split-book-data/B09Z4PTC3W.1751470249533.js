window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>My whole life is one tangled lie. A horrible deception. All my past choices steered by the woman who hunts me without pause.</p> <p>She’s powerful, vicious, and cruel, feared by the entire supernatural community. She’s also an immortal. Yeah, she can’t be killed—supposedly. Nothing like an insurmountable challenge, right?</p> <p>I’ve trained for years to defeat any opponent, and this time, I have my mate Bruno, my sister, my pack, and a pair of strange mages at my side, ready to go down fighting with me.</p> <p>My enemy might be invincible, but that won’t stop us from doing everything we can to take her down. Better to live in a world without her in it than to keep going when she’s controlled everything I’ve ever done. Either way, I’ll secure my freedom.</p> <p>With nothing to lose, and everything to gain, I <i>will</i> find the way to kill her before she ends me. With magic, the impossible is never quite what it seems.<br> <br> The Rocky Mountain Pack series is gritty, sexy, and action-packed paranormal shifter romance.</p> <p><i>Wolf Destinies</i> is a full-length novel recommended for mature listeners due to language, sexual situations, and graphic fighting scenes.</p>";
