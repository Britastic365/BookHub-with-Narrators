Carter has always followed the rules - until she makes a mistake that leaves her the talk of her college campus and brings her carefully arranged life crashing to a halt. Now she's stuck in her small hometown for the summer so she can complete her court-ordered community service. To make matters worse, trouble is living right next door. </p> <p>Jaxon Trent is the worst kind of temptation and exactly what K. C. was supposed to stay away from in high school. But he never forgot her. She was the one girl who wouldn't give him the time of day and the only one ever to say no. Fate has brought K. C. back into his life - except what he thought was a great twist of luck turns out to be too close for comfort. </p> <p>As they grow closer, he discovers that convincing K. C. to get out from under her mother's shadow is hard, but revealing the darkest parts of his soul is nearly impossible.</p>";
