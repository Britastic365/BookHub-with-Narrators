Since werewolf cage fighting isn't illegal in Louisiana, Ronan makes big plans to lead his own team in the ring. But when he sets eyes on sweet Celine Cruz, his whole world stops, and she becomes a tantalizing distraction he doesn't need.</p> <p>As an Aura witch, Celine always wants to help heal the broken. She knows all too well what it's like to battle anxiety, and so she's dedicated her life to helping those in need. But the second she meets Ronan, she knows she's in trouble. He's everything her close-knit family would hate: a werewolf with a hot temper and a sinful grin to match who runs with a dangerous crowd. So why can't she stay away?</p> <p>Ronan thinks she's a good girl. Little does he know that all Celine wants is to do wicked things with the bad boy werewolf who revels in breaking all her rules. As their forbidden romance becomes too tempting to resist, Ronan notices that the wolves are circlingâ€¦ and they're coming after his mate.</p>";
