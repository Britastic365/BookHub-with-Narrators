window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The girls in Mama Si's Paradise live like royalty. Real-life princesses. Dolls, she calls them, and what they do is entertain her very beautiful, very wealthy guests.</b></p> <p>They hide the true face of the Paradise so well…</p> <p>Good ole me went in there to apply for a housekeeping position after I caught my boyfriend cheating, and he kicked me out. Nobody in town was hiring, so I thought, what the hell? Even though I knew what that place was, I went.</p> <p>Then Mama Si saw me.</p> <p>She took one look at me, told me that the vacancy was no longer available, but that she had a better offer to make me—to become one of her dolls.</p> <p>I accepted because she promised me freedom. She promised me power. She promised me magic.</p> <p>She lied.</p> <p>My whole world turns upside down for me within days. I end up bitten by a dragon and stuck in an isle where the sun never shines. Stuck in the Evernight Court, as the bride-to-be of one of the five Evernight brothers who rule the Seven Isles—what is left of the world of magic on Earth.</p> <p>They're powerful vampires, hungry for new blood, desperate for an heir, each more breathtakingly beautiful than the last—and all of them trying to make me theirs.</p> <p>I pretend to play along while I search for an escape from their Isle and hope to make it back home in one piece.</p> <p>Except the Evernight brothers are not easily fooled. Secrets hang in the air, and there's a storm lurking in the distance that nobody seems to know about. The more time I spend in their midst, the more I am convinced that I will never find my way back, that I will have no choice but to accept my fate on the Isle.</p> <p>And the first question is, which one of the brothers will make me their bride?</p> <p><i>For mature listeners.</i></p>";
