window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Megan: Have you ever fallen so deeply for someone that you’d be willing to do anything for them? I was willing to do anything for Aaron, including leaving him if it meant keeping him from getting tangled up in my past. Aaron wasn’t going to let me run. Even if there was an army after me, he’d gather arms and prepare for a war.</p> <p>Aaron: Letting Megan go wasn’t an option. She’d become a part of me that I couldn’t live without. Some of the horrifying secrets from her past had been revealed, but I believed Megan’s final secret had the power to rain down hellfire on my MC, and I’d been right.</p> <p>When my father went behind my back and called my cousin Ansel for backup, I knew that all hell was about to break loose, and I ended up preparing to fight an adversary so dangerous, my life teetered on the brink of extinction.</p> <p><b>Warning: </b>This book is an interracial romance that contains strong violence and sexual content and is intended for adults.
