window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>New York Times</i> best-selling author P. C. Cast presents the first novel in her Goddess Summoning series. </p> <p>Home alone on the night of her 25th birthday, Air Force Sergeant Christine Canady yearned for something to cure her loneliness. After drinking too much champagne, she recited a divine invocation to revive her humdrum life. But how was she to know the spell would actually work? </p> <p>When her plane crashes into the ocean, CC's life changes forever. She awakens, bewildered, to find herself in a legendary time and place ruled by magic - and in the body of the mythic mermaid Undine. But danger lurks in the waters, ready to swallow CC whole. Taking pity on her, the goddess Gaea turns her into a damsel, that she might seek shelter on land. But when a dashing knight comes to CC's rescue - a dream-come-true she should be falling for - she instead aches for the sea and the darkly sexy merman who's stolen her heart. </p>";
