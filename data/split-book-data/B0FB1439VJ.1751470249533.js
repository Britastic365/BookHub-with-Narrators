window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The war is over… but the trouble is only just beginning</b></p> <p>Thysandra's world is falling apart. Rebels have overthrown the fae empire she's served for centuries. Worse, she's the one who caused the defeat—tricked into treason by her longtime nemesis and romantic obsession, Naxi, who then promptly abandoned her again, like the empathy-lacking demon she is.</p> <p>Execution by rebels would be a relief at this point. Instead, the bastards name her High Lady of the very court she just betrayed. Punishment or reward, Thys isn't quite sure.</p> <p>Now, she's supposed to restore order at the Crimson Court… but fae are clamouring for violent revenge. Humans want rights and reparations. There's a sentient mountain causing trouble, and Naxi is suddenly prancing around the castle again, refusing to leave, and murdering people left and right. Most ridiculously of all, she's claiming Thysandra is madly in love with her.</p> <p>Agreeing to work together is the only way to restrain the little menace. But when tensions at the court rise to a breaking point, simple cooperation may no longer be enough… Because someone is undermining Thys at every turn. And if she doesn't soon decide how much she can trust this fickle demon she can't help but desire, it may just be the death of them both.</p> <p>With Wing and Claw <i>is a steamy sapphic fantasy romance featuring a former villain coming to terms with herself, a stabby demon with no morals but plenty of charm, and lots of deadly court intrigue. It can be enjoyed as a standalone, although certain events will be more meaningful for listeners of the main Fae Isles series.</i></p>";
