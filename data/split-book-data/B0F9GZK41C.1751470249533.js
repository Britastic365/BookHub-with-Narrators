window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Serenity</b></p> <p>Serenity Rose Johnson has only one hope, and that's to find a pack that will treat her kindly and maybe allow her to follow her dreams of being a fashion designer. She hasn't had it easy, but somehow, she's never given up that hope, not even after her dads sold her to omega traffickers to settle their debts.</p> <p>Her foolish hope helps her to escape her abusers, but she finds herself alone on the side of a deserted road in the middle of winter, in the dead of night. Headlights are the last thing she sees before unconsciousness and certain death.</p> <p>But when Serenity wakes up, she isn't dead, although she might just be in heaven: the mansion of the famous Pack Rhodes, four of the country's most eligible bachelors. Business mogul Sebastián Rivera St. James, rock star Malcolm Rivers, pro linebacker Tane Kekoa, and their pack leader, heartthrob actor Remy Rhodes, just happen to be searching for a pack omega. As the handsome alphas nurse her back to health, Serenity can't help but hope that she might be what they're looking for.</p> <p><b>Remy</b></p> <p>Remy Rhodes has a plan, and Serenity Rose Johnson isn't in it. His family—and the rest of the world—have high expectations for him and, as pack leader, it's up to him to make sure that Pack Rhodes maintains their impeccable reputation. They have wealth, power, and fame. There's only one thing missing, and they'll finally have it all.</p> <p>After years of hard work and preparation, they're ready to complete their pack—they just have to find their perfect omega. Of course, Remy has carefully compiled a list of suitable women who would bring his pack even more prestige. He's more than prepared to choose between five rich, beautiful omegas who belong in Pack Rhodes's world.</p> <p>So, when his friends stumble into the packhouse after a night of partying carrying an unconscious, unbonded omega, Remy is far from happy about it. He's even less happy when he catches the potency of her scent and sees the way she affects his packmates… and Remy himself, if he's being honest. Before long, he has to admit that his pack is falling for the sassy little omega from the wrong side of the tracks.</p> <p>Now, it'll take all his careful control to keep their plans on track and keep their unexpected guest from upending their entire lives.</p> <p><i>Contains mature content.
