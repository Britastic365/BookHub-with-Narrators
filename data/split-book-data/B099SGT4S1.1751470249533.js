They’re all Owen Brodie.</i><br> <i>It’s only funny if you aren’t the hilarious struggling comedian who has been hired to be his son’s nanny for the stand-up tour.</i></p> <p><b>Dear Ms. Hogan,</b></p> <p>I’m emailing to offer you the job as my son’s nanny because Sam had a temper tantrum when I told him I can’t hire you to come on my stand-up tour with us. “She heckled me at a club a few years ago,” I wanted to say. “She is the sassy little turd who trolls me on Twitter,” I could have told him. “She’s an even bigger pain in the butt when we’re face-to-face,” I thought to myself. What I would never tell him is - <i>things could get complicated. For reasons</i>.</p> <p>Let me know if you want the job.</p> <p>With great reluctance,<br> Owen</p> <p>#AdorableHowObsessedYouAreWithMe</p> <p><b>Dear Mr. Brodie,</b></p> <p>Thank you for your email. Please inform Sam that I like him very much and would love to be his nanny and accompany him on your terrible joke of a stand-up tour.</p> <p>I can assure you - things will not get complicated. For many, many reasons.</p> <p>Primarily because Owen Brodie isn’t funny, and he can suck it.</p> <p>Out of financial desperation and a fondness for your son,<br> Frankie</p> <p>#GetOverYourselfPrettyBoy</p> <p>* This audiobook is completely duet style. Narrated by Teddy Hamilton and Emma Wilder. Featuring Zachary Webber, Jason Clarke, Mackenzie Cartwright and Connor Crais.</p>";
