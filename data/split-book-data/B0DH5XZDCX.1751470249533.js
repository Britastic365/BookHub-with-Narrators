window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Get your affairs in order, tissues ready, and plans cleared for the beautifully tragic prequel to the Rogue x Ara series.</b></p> <p>\"Write me a letter for every apple you've taken.\"</p> <p>For centuries, Vaelor Wrynwood has kept his circle small and his love life smaller. While he once dreamed of being an artist, alive and free, that was a lifetime ago. Now, his heart belongs to his people, and there isn't room for anything—or anyone—else.</p> <p>He may not have been thriving, but his kingdom was and that was all that mattered.</p> <p>Until he returns to his orchard to find a human woman strolling through it, barefoot and humming to herself.</p> <p>Their story begins here, with apples, a friendship, and hundreds of letters across worlds.</p> <p>Two hearts who could not be more different. Two souls never meant to cross.</p> <p>Or were they?</p> <p><i>Welcome back to the world of Ravaryn and Auryna nearly thirty years before Rogue and Ara's story begins. While it does contain love, healing, and so many tender moments, it is not your typical fantasy romance—rather, a romantic tragedy set in a fantasy realm. For mature listeners.</i></p>";
