window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Clover: The man may be my brother's new second in command, but to me, Joshua's just the bossy pain in the ass who's way too good at getting under my skin. To be fair, I suppose my less-than-sunny disposition when he's around can take some of the credit for provoking him. I can't help it. He's the pack's alpha cat—a hulking, hot mountain lion shifter, and thus the bane of my existence on principle. Cats and I, we don't mix. A pride of lions from California had slaughtered my parents when I was a kid, making sport of hunting me nearly to death as well. Then not too long ago, a psycho she-cat shot me with a poisoned dart. Seriously. Give me a skunk over a cat any day.</p> <p>Joshua: I'm well aware of how easily I can rile up my boss's little sister. Who can blame me? The feisty she-wolf is like my own personal catnip. With claws. So when a rare second heat sends Clover running for the hills—my hills—there's no way in hell I'm going to let the opportunity to finally claim my mate pass me by. Her head may have her convinced she can't trust me, but the rest of her sure isn't listening anymore.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
