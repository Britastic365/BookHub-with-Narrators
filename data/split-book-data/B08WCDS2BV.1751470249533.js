window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I used to hunt witches. Now I live with one. </p> <p>To further complicate things, my past as a supernatural bounty hunter doesn’t exactly make me popular in these new circles I’m running in.</p> <p>Shocker, I know. Someone wants me dead. </p> <p>He wants me to stay in Nathalie’s apartment and be safe while he handles the threat, all while holding Bree’s future over my head.</p> <p>Not gonna happen. To say I’m f--ked is an understatement. But I’ve been in worse spots before. Lucifer may be gone, but the corruption of magic isn’t. I have enemies everywhere. And this time, they’re going to know what it means to burn. </p> <p>Some things are worse than the devil. To save Bree, I’ll become one of them. </p> <p>If you can’t get enough of books by Ella Summers, Annette Marie, Shannon Mayer, Deborah Wilde, K.F. Breene, Jeaniene Frost, Kelly St. Clare, and Linsey Hall, then dive right in to the dangerous depths of New Chicago. Beware of headstrong heroines with snark. These ladies don’t bark. They bite. </p> <p>Start the series with <i>Touched by Fire</i> or preorder book two now!</p>";
