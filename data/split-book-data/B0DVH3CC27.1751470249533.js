window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Alaia</b></p> <p>After my Yaya passed away, I didn't have anyone that cared for me. I mean, not even a month after Yaya was in the ground, he sat me down in the living room and sold me to a thirty-year-old man. I was sixteen, and my big brother, the man who was supposed to protect me, sold me off like cattle on a farm.</p> <p>My entire life has been to please Zayne. I'm his fourth wife and the youngest wife. Nobody has ever protected or cared for me. I was tossed the cards that life handed me and had to make do with them. That is until Cappadonna Delgato and I cross paths—again.</p> <p><b>Cappadonna</b></p> <p>All it took was for me to see her one time in that visitation room to know that I needed her. Alaia—her name literally means joy and happiness, and I didn't see anything of the sort in her eyes when she stared into my eyes that day. As Allah would have it, our paths were meant to cross on the outside, and they did.</p> <p>I'm a protector, a provider, and a man, and I don't think Alaia has ever had that in her life. I don't care what I have to do or who I have to see to make her mine. She went years without knowing what protection and true love felt like, and I'm stepping up to make sure she doesn't go another day not knowing how I feel or how I'm coming behind her. If I say she's mine, she's mine, and I've never been afraid to shed blood to prove it.</p>";
