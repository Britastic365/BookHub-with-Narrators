You, Knight Deveraux, will learn to coexist.\"</p> <p>I've never heard more wasted words in my life. Then again, the gifted counsel never did have much to say that wasn't. The only members amongst them who speak a thing worth listening to are my parents, the king and queen of the Stygians, the people of Dark magic.</p> <p>Unfortunately for me and my brothers, they've chosen to play nice instead of sinking their talons into anyone who dares demand a thing from their heirs. In this instance at least.</p> <p>Every Gifted is forced to leave our realm behind after graduation to spend the next four years in a world that isn't ours, while pretending it's enough for those with something deeper clawing beneath their skin.</p> <p>It isn't. Not by a long shot, and while it's as boring as I thought it would be, we find ways to entertain ourselves.</p> <p>A little Fae Dust, the power of persuasion, and it's a party worthy of a royal...or four.</p> <p>That was fun the first year, but it's my second now, and the minute I got back to campus, I knew it would be worse than before.
