window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Ray</b></p> <p>As a mechanic in a family full of lawyers, I'm used to being the black sheep. All I want in life is to run my auto repair shop with my trusted employees and live my life in peace. That peace is shattered when a gorgeous girl with innocent green eyes filled with fear shows up at my shop. It's clear she's hiding from someone. There's something about the girl that thaws my cold, lonely heart. It doesn't take long for me to decide that this sweet angel is mine, and I'll do anything to protect her and erase the haunted look in her eyes.</p> <p><b>Penny</b></p> <p>When my father died, I was devastated. When his business partner, Jonah, moved into our home, I was terrified. The way he looks at me and the accidental touches make my skin crawl. It's not long before he's dictating my every move, and I'm forced to drop out of school. My mother is too lost in her grief to see what is happening, and I try to stay strong for her, but when Jonah crosses a line too far to ignore, I know I have to get out. Seizing the first chance I find, I flee. But escaping my new stepfather won't be easy, and when I need a quick place to hide, I stop at an auto shop in the small town of Rosewood. There, I find far more than a temporary asylum. I find shelter, safety, and maybe even... love. Ray is rough around the edges, but something tells me I can believe him when he vows to protect me.</p>";
