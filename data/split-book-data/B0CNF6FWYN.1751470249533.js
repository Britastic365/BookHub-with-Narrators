window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Ghosts and murder follow her everywhere, even to paradise.</b></p> <p>When Charlie Payne’s boyfriend Tom sweeps her off to a romantic getaway on a dreamy tropical island for ten days, she can’t wait to get away from work and hopefully the ghosts that plague her every day as a psychic detective.</p> <p>Their fun getaway takes a dark turn when a wealthy financier dies mysteriously at their resort. All the evidence points to Tom, but Charlie refuses to stand idly by and watch as he’s accused of murder by the living, and condemned by the dead. With the aid of her witchy cousins and the resident ghosts on the tiny island, she sets out to prove his innocence.</p> <p>Along the way, she uncovers a complex web of deceit and secrets that runs as deep as the ocean. With a police inspector ready to arrest her for obstruction, a pirate ghost out for her blood, and a storm on the horizon, the only thing she’s sure of is her feelings for Tom. But every discovery tests her love to its breaking point. </p> <p>Survive a hurricane? Done it. Survive an attack by a pirate ghost? Easy peasy. Survive without the love of her life?</p>";
