window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A career-ending mission sends Trey Durum’s life into a death spiral. Out of control, scarred, and with his spirit broken, he tries to adjust to civilian life. His plan to fade into the background goes up in smoke when Adalynn Walker crashes into his life. The sexy physical therapist has everyone fooled. She’s not sweet. She’s not shy. She’s not patient or kind. She’s a ball-busting sadist who pushes his body during PT sessions and refuses to allow the former SEAL to wallow in his misery. She’s also the woman who sets his soul on fire and makes him forget he’s half the man he once was. </p> <p>Adalynn Walker feels no sympathy for the bitter war hero who blows off his PT appointments more than he shows. The man is infuriating as much as he is captivating. Addy tries her best to keep their relationship professional, but when Trey shows her the man under the cynical, hostile façade, there’s no denying her inappropriate crush is so much more. Trey Durum’s the man she’s been waiting for, but when her past comes back to haunt her, everything turns to hell, and Addy’s life is left in shambles. </p> <p>Trey has one chance to earn Addy’s trust. One chance to prove not only to her but to her family that he’s the man for her. Is the well-trained commando ready for the fight of his life, or will his own scars keep him from the woman he loves? </p>";
