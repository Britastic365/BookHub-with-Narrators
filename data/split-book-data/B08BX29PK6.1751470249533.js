window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Welcome to Nocturne Falls, the town that celebrates Halloween 365 days a year. The tourists think it's all a show: the vampires, the werewolves, the witches, the occasional gargoyle flying through the sky. But the supernaturals populating the town know better. </p> <p>Living in Nocturne Falls means being yourself. Fangs, fur, and all. </p> <p>Fire chief and werewolf Titus Merrow has a pretty good life. Great family, great job, great friends. No love interest, sure, but he’s got too much going on to worry about that. Like the 10K race for charity that he’s helping to plan. Too bad the woman he’s planning it with is so hot. No, wait. He meant annoying. </p> <p>Sheriff’s deputy and valkyrie Jenna Blythe has somehow gotten stuck working on a charity event with her boss’ brother. Not only is Titus Merrow full of himself, but he challenges every suggestion she makes about the race. Why are the handsome ones always so smug? She can’t wait to beat him in the competition and bring home the trophy for the sheriff’s department. Again. </p> <p>But when they answer a call together and things explode, dangerous magic is unleashed. They’re suddenly forced to work together. Literally. And the magic only gets more treacherous as time ticks forward. Not even Jenna’s good friend seems to be able to help them as shady forces lurk in every shadow. </p> <p>Swords and sorcery abound, and Jenna’s past comes back to haunt her. She and Titus are left with no choice but to question everything - and everyone. Who’s targeting them? Is what they’re feeling real? Can love survive against darkness? Can a valkyrie learn to run with the pack? </p>";
