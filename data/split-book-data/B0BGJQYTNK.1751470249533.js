He's </b><b><i>the</i></b><b> boss.</b></p> <p>I can still remember the moment I first heard Cyrus Holt's deep, commanding voice.</p> <p>I didn't know who he was or about the life he'd left behind. I was just a trembling orphan on the run from a monster, and he was the man offering me shelter and not giving me a choice about it.</p> <p>This boss of bosses didn't assign someone else to watch over me. He slept on the floor next to my bed when I woke up scared, then spanked me like a naughty little girl when I lied to him.</p> <p>He could have claimed me that night, ravaging me without mercy or remorse.</p> <p>But he didn't. He made me beg for it first. Because he didn't just want me as his for a night. He wanted me as his to keep.</p> <p><i>Mine to Keep</i> is a standalone novel, which is the first book of the Kept as His series. It includes spankings and rough, intense sexual scenes intended for mature listeners.</p>";
