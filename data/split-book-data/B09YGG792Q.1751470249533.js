Adapted from the novel and produced with a full cast of actors, immersive sound effects and cinematic music!<br> <br> Feyre has undergone more trials than one human woman can carry in her heart. Though she’s now been granted the powers and lifespan of the High Fae, she is haunted by her time Under the Mountain and the terrible deeds she performed to save the lives of Tamlin and his people.<br> <br> As her marriage to Tamlin approaches, Feyre’s hollowness and nightmares consume her.

While Feyre navigates a dark web of politics, passion, and dazzling power, a greater evil looms.
