window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Here’s a riddle for you.</b></p> <p><b>What has dark hair, two souls, and a really bad attitude?</b></p> <p>Good question. Whatever it is, Neveah Lane is currently trapped in a motel room with it.</p> <p>No one should be able to escape from Hell. No one should be able to wriggle out of a contractual soul-bond with a demon. Apparently, the creature that was once Mab, Queen of the Fae, has done both.</p> <p>As the last angel on Earth, Neveah is determined to rescue the human whose body Mab hijacked during her rampage. Meanwhile, everyone else seems committed to capturing an innocent woman and dragging her off for summary execution to kill the thing inside her.</p> <p>Briefly, Neveah thought she’d found an ally in Nigellus, the suave demon spymaster tasked with returning Mab to Hell. But everyone knows angels and demons don’t mix. To avert an all-out war between the realms, both Nigellus and Neveah will go to extreme lengths to achieve what they think is right.</p> <p>Neither of them needs another enemy. On the contrary, both of them need all the friends they can get—but the ugly history between Heaven and Hell looms large.</p> <p><b>Shared adversity might be good for building a bridge.</b></p> <p><b>Unfortunately, a flaming sword is better for burning it to ashes.</b></p> <p>* * * </p> <p><i>The Sixth Demon</i> is a new urban fantasy romance series by R. A. Steffan, set in the same world as the best-selling series The Last Vampire, Vampire Bound, and Forsaken Fae. Download book two today and return to a world shared by humans, angels, demons, fae, and vampires. It’s a place where the supernatural threatens the mundane, nothing is as it seems, and love will either be the world’s downfall—or its salvation.</p>";
