window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From USA Today best-selling author Trisha Wolfe comes a fierce and seductively thrilling Dark Mafia Romance stand-alone as part of the Broken Heirs series. </p> <p>Rapture. Desire. Need. </p> <p>The yearning for our passions is the reason we breathe. I've devoted my life to my pursuit of ballet, my escape from the dark underworld I was born into. As the daughter of a made man, I've accepted certain traditions, but after I'm promoted to principal within a prestigious dance company, I'm so close to escaping that world. Until a devil with blood on his hands and an Irish curse inked into his skin tears into my world. </p> <p>Now passion holds a whole new sinister meaning. With ruination in his steel-blue eyes and me in his crosshairs, Lucian Cross traps me in his gilded cage and uses me to deliver his retribution. Forced to sign a marriage contract, my father traded my life to save his own. I'm bound to Lucian. Owned by a monster who swore an oath of pain and suffering to my family.</p> <p>Lucian's passion is revenge. Every night he forces me to dance until my breaking point. He wants to condition me to loathe the very thing that once gave me hope. The closer we get to the wedding date, the more entangled I become in his dangerous, tempting world until I'm losing myself to him. His vow is my pain. My vow is not to fall for the enemy. But I can't dance with the devil without getting singed by the fire. </p> <p>*CW: Please check author's website for full list of content warnings.</p>";
