She's ignored her own desires for the good of her family, but an unexpected request from Thailand sends her on a mission that could change her life and alter the fate of free Grigori all over the world. Sons of the Fallen hidden in the mountains of Thailand have adapted an ancient human magic for their own purposes. Will this practice bring peace or lead to even greater danger for the Irin race? </p> <p>A simple diplomatic mission sends Leo to Bangkok, but he didn't expect to see a familiar face in surveillance photographs. He's tried everything to drive Kyra from his mind, since he was convinced the gentle kareshta wanted to hide from the world. How did she turn up halfway across the globe, living with Grigori who may or may not be Irin allies? </p> <p>Leo has bided his time. He's given Kyra her space. </p> <p>But this scribe is ready to hear a kareshta sing. </p> <p><b><i>Contains mature themes.</i></b></p>";
