She's a pawn in all of this, but I'll get that information even if it means I have to cut it out of her - piece by f--king piece.</p> <p>This little charade is about to end. They thought they could drag me down into the dirt and grind my soul into the dust. What they failed to realize is that there's nothing left of my soul, and I don't mind getting a little dirty if it means getting my revenge. I may have let her fool me once, but there's no way in hell I'll let her fool me twice.</p> <p>After I'm done with her, I'm going after the big boys.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
