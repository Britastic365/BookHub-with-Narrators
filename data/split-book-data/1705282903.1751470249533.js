This summer is going to be a scorcher. </b></p> <p>A writer who's blocked - I'm a total cliche. </p> <p>Lucky for me, my agent has a cure that's an even bigger stereotype - a month at her villa in Tuscany, with nothing to do but find my muse. </p> <p>When he walks right in the front door, adorable son in tow, it feels like fate has finally done for me what it does for every other clich√©d girl I've seen in the movies. Except that he's completely off-limits. In this case, business and pleasure can never mix. </p> <p>Because Claudio is my agent's ex. </p> <p>Still, he's smart, charming, and wickedly sexy, plus a great father to Vanni. He's fast becoming the cure to all my writing woes. And it's clear he wants me as much as I want him. </p> <p>As the hot Italian summer wears on, it becomes harder and harder to resist. Succumbing to the heat even just one time could ruin my career. Or he could be exactly what I need.</p> <p><i>Contains mature themes.</i></p>";
