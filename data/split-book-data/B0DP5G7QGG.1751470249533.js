window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A protective hero and his best friend’s fearless sister risk everything as desire and danger collide in this heart-pounding romantic mystery from Wall Street Journal bestselling author Brittney Sahin.</p> <p>Hudson Ashford, a former Navy SEAL turned private security expert, has sworn off romance—especially when it comes to his best friend’s sister. Between protecting clients, running his bar, and avoiding the political spotlight as the son of a prominent governor, Hudson keeps his life tightly controlled, leaving no room for complications—or emotions. </p> <p>Isabella Costa, a headstrong billionaire with a compassionate heart, refuses to give up on the future she dreamed of with the man she thought she could never have. But when a dangerous threat from their past resurfaces, chaos erupts. What begins as a routine undercover operation quickly spirals into murder, trapping them in a nightmare from which there’s no escape. Forced into close quarters, Hudson and Isabella must confront not only their shared history but also their undeniable attraction. </p> <p>As enemies close in and deadly consequences loom, can they outrun the secrets of their past? Or will the truth they uncover tear them apart forever? Duet narration by Connor Crais and Ava Lucas. Special guest cameo by Joseph Cannata.</p>";
