window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Audiobook eight (of nine) in the best-selling, multi-award-winning Beyond series.</p> <p>The O’Kanes have a reputation for working hard and playing harder - except for Hawk. He joined the gang with one goal: to ensure his family’s survival through the impending war with Eden. It’s been years since he had the luxury of wanting anything for himself. Now, he wants Jeni. From the first moment he saw her, he’s been obsessed with making her his. Not for a night - forever.</p> <p>Jeni’s been lusting after the former smuggler for months, but he keeps shutting her down. She’s almost given up on getting him in her bed when he offers her the last thing she ever expected - a collar. Accepting it means belonging to him, body and soul. It’s a reckless gamble, but Jeni can’t resist the chance to slip under Hawk’s armor.</p> <p>The only thing more shocking than the dark, dangerous pleasure they discover is how right it feels. But falling in love is even more reckless when forever is far from guaranteed. Because they aren’t just at war, they’re out of time - and every breath could be their last.</p> <p>The Beyond series is dystopian erotic romance. While the audiobooks explore kink and sex with multiple partners in a dark and decadent world, all sex between characters is 100 percent consensual.</p>";
