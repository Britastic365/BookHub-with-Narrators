window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The secret is out.</p> <p>I’m officially dating the entire Student Council, but that’s not the only thing that’s outside the norm at Adamson All-Boys Academy.</p> <p>Nah, I think the murders are a bit more remarkable, although my dad might disagree. He’s not exactly thrilled with my fake fiancé or the other four boys who make my pulse race.</p> <p>With two current students dead and three attackers on my tail, it looks like I’m next. The fact that I’m a target isn’t in question, but are the people closest to me involved somehow? Everyone’s a suspect—my family, my classmates, even my new boyfriends.</p> <p>Okay, that’s it. I’m going to do it: I’m going to attend Adamson in a f--king skirt and kick some ass.</p> <p>Follow the clues, catch the bad guys, secure my future. Because, murder-mysteries aside, this is my final year of high school, and nothing lasts forever, right? Not even a forever crew.</p> <p><i>The Forever Crew</i> is a 100,000-word lighthearted reverse-harem/high school/murder-mystery romance novel with a bully/suspense twist. This is book three of three in the series (with a fourth book crossover coming, titled <i>Orientation</i>, that connects this series with my Rich Boys of Burberry Prep series). Contains foul language and sexual scenes; any sex featured is consensual.</p>";
