Alexandra's journey will test the limits of her sanity at the same time as it challenges her perceptions of justice.</p> <p>Will she be just another victim? Or do they have something different in mind for their little Darling?</p> <p>Hunt Me Darling <i>is a why-choose MFM dark contemporary romance. It contains explicit sexual content and straight-up smut. The male leads are not Prince Charming. They are villains with psycho tendencies, and therefore there is stalking, obsessive and possessive behavior, unaliving people, and lots of dark and twisted content. Intended for mature listeners.</i></p>";
