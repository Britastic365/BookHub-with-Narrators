window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I never planned on sleeping with him. Nor did I intend to make him my enemy. I only went into the bar to scope out my competition–him. The scorching hot night that followed was a mutually pleasurable accident. Of course I knew we were in the running for the same position.</p> <p>It’s not my fault he didn’t know who I was.</p> <p>Gathering intel is my specialty.</p> <p>Maybe if he were better at it, he would have gotten the job instead of me.</p> <p>I tried my hardest to resist our chemistry, but he was too damn hot.</p> <p>Too charming. Too funny. Too masculine.</p> <p>And he smelled so freaking good.</p> <p>My hormones took over.</p> <p>Now we're working together on the Redleg Security intelligence team. Every day. High stress. Close quarters. Sexual chemistry off the charts.</p> <p>But he hates me.</p> <p>The thing is… he should hate me. I treated him like a pawn.</p> <p>But he’s a real man with dreams, passion, and pain.</p> <p>And I’ve never wanted someone as much as I want him.</p> <p>But it’s too late for us.</p> <p>I made us rivals when we could have been so much more.</p> <p>Note: Rival Hero is a bodyguard romantic suspense story with rom-com vibes. It features a strong heroine who's a former CIA intelligence officer and a swoony former Army Ranger hero who will make you laugh one minute and swoon the next. There's action and all the feels, along with a healthy dose of humor and tons of spice. There is an HEA, no cheating, and no \"other woman\" drama. Content warnings are available on the author's website.</p> <p>Tropes: One night stand to office rivals to lovers, good boy goes bad, and forced proximity.</p> <p>Listening Order: Rival Hero is Book 4 in the Redleg Security Series. Each of the first four books in this series features a different couple, including their happily ever after and is a \"complete story\" with no cliffhangers. However, the series is best enjoyed in order to avoid suspense-related plot spoilers. Each book starts right where the prior book ends. If you do not wish to listen to them all, then you can listen as a stand-alone.</p>";
