window.bookSummaryJSON = "Greg Bear is \"a writer who is rapidly redefining the shape of the modern hard science-fiction novel\" (Keith Ferrell, <i>Omni</i> magazine), and in <i>Moving Mars</i> he explores one very plausible scenario for the future of Earth's neighboring planet.<p>Mars is a colonial world governed by corporate interests on Earth. The citizens of Mars are hardworking, brave, and intelligent, but held back by their lack of access to the best education, and the desire of Earthly powers to keep the best inventions for themselves.</p><p>The young Martians - the second and third generation born on Mars - have little loyalty to Earth and a strong belief that their planet can be independent. The revolution begins slowly, but matures to its inevitable conclusion.</p>";
