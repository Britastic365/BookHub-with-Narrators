window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A smoking-hot MFM suspense romance performed by Robert Hatchet, Allyson Voller, and Jay Alder.</p> <p>A year ago, I let a stranger kiss me in a crowded bar. Now, he and his best friend are my new bosses.</p> <p>When I fled Arizona, I knew keeping a low profile was the only way to stay off my crooked ex’s radar. Which means no dating, no deep friendships, no sticking my neck out. So it’s completely wrong that I not only let a handsome, rugged stranger kiss me in a crowded bar, but that when he and his friend become my new bosses, I change from a hardworking, respectable teacher into a needy, desperate mess.</p> <p>The more I try to resist them, the sexier they get, until one late night mixed with a stolen kiss turns the tables, and the fire that’s been smoldering between us explodes.</p> <p>But it was just a matter of time before the nightmare from my past found me, threatening the sweet haven we created.</p> <p>Can I trust my two heroes to help me fight back, or will what I’m running from destroy us once and for all?</p> <p>Start listening to this steamy and suspenseful \"why choose\"-style romance today!</p>";
