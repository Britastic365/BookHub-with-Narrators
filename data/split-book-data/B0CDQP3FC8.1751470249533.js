window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>Fighting fate isn’t for the weak.</i></b><br> <br> <i>Cait</i><br> I am many things, but a supernatural being is not one of them. At least not until a crescent mark appears on my wrist and everything changes. I’ve been marked by a wolf goddess, yet no one knows what that means, myself included.<br> <br> On top of that, I find out my best friend is a wolf shifter and her pack alpha is my supposed mate. Just like that my future is decided—unless I find a way out.<br> <br> <i>Roman</i><br> When fate sends a human mate my way, I’m certain it has to be a mistake. An alpha is supposed to have an equal at his side. Cait might be strong in her own ways, but what she is makes her an easy target in my world.<br> <br> Regardless, Cait is mine to protect and I have every intention of showing her this is where she belongs—in my pack, by my side. Even if she seems intent on rejecting me.<br> <br> <br> <i>This complete wolf shifter series includes three stories plus bonus content. Each story is told in dual POV from our two main characters and totals over 900 pages!<br> <br> Luna Marked features a strong willed, not-so-human leading lady and a fierce yet loyal alpha who is determined to win her heart—no matter how many times she might reject him. If you love slow burn Paranormal Romance books, then be ready to devour this series! This is the second series in the Mystics and Mayhem world, but they can be listened to in any order.</i></p>";
