But this is not a wondrous fantasy world. This is real life, and Nell just wanted to go home and eat macaroni. As Nell stares at the smoldering corpse, she realizes something with horrifying certainty: She's magic.</p> <p>And not the cute pulling-a-rabbit-from-a-hat kind of magic.</p> <p>Unfortunately, during Nell's little outburst, she suffers a mortal injury. Fortunately, Darragh, a rugged and magical outcast, witnessed the entire incident. To save Nell's life, Darragh whisks her away to a world where magic reigns. However, as is so often the case with magic, it comes at a price. In this harsh world, the entities that lurk in the darkest corners of Nell's nightmares await her in hungry anticipation.</p> <p>As Nell and Darragh vanquish monsters and ghouls, their affections for one another take root. Just when this treacherous tale is beginning to look like a love story, Darragh is captured by a wretched, cadaverous queen.</p> <p>Now, it's up to Nell to save him</p> <p>The Forest Where the Phoenix Sleeps <i>boasts portal magic reminiscent of A Darker Shade of Magic, the romance of</i> A Court of Thorns and Roses, <i>the action-packed adventure of</i> Daughter of the Moon Goddess, <i>and the humor of</i> Tress of the Emerald Sea.</p>";
