window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>USA Today</i> best-selling author, Ella Fields, delivers a heart-wrenching tale of impossible yet unstoppable love in this all-new standalone enemies to lovers fantasy romance. </p> <p>The king of wolves was more beast than man, more tyrant than king, and so much more than he seemed. </p> <p>Raised to avenge his murdered parents, he’d been trained and conditioned until nothing but violence and hatred lined the walls of his dead heart. </p> <p>For nearly four years, I’d done all I could to help my kingdom as we faced the wolf king’s unconquerable evil — hardly anything at all. </p> <p>As the only heir to the Gracewood line, I’d been relegated to menial tasks that would keep me and my secrets safe. </p> <p>A chance to do more than fret behind our castle walls arrived when I breached them after overhearing my parents’ plans for my future. Fleeing, I unknowingly raced into a fate we’d all desperately hoped to avoid. </p> <p>By the time I saw him coming, it was far too late. For my family. For my kingdom. </p> <p>For my heart. </p> <p>Before I could staunch the bleeding, the king had me under his giant paw, and one wrong move after another caused those razor-sharp claws to sink deeper and deeper beneath my bruised skin. </p> <p>I might have been trapped, naïve, and furious, but I still had a kingdom to save — and a plan. </p> <p>Yet when we collided, the bloodshed, the fear, his atrocities...all of it dissolved like stardust upon the night sea. </p> <p>The stars had mapped out our destiny, but it didn’t matter what they or my heart wanted. </p> <p>I refused to see the enigmatic male, the heartless lost boy with a soul beneath the flesh of a monster. </p> <p>The savage king who’d destroyed everything I loved would fall — even if my heart fell with him. </p> <p><i>Inspired by Hades and Persephone, Rumpelstiltskin, and The Swan Princess, The Savage and the Swan is not connected to any other Ella Fields novel. It’s a full-length standalone romantic fantasy containing mature content.</i></p>";
