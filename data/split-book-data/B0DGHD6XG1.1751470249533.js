window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Always protect the heart of the ice.</b></p> <p><b>Max</b></p> <p>This wasn't supposed to happen to me. I'm supposed to be at the top of my career. Untouchable. Worshiped. Finally proving to all the jerks in my life that I made it. I'm at the top.</p> <p>Then a video that shouldn't exist leaks and everything comes crashing down. I'm about to lose it all and I can't seem to get out of my own way. My agent banishes me to a place that technology can't touch while he tries to salvage my career.</p> <p>I'm caught between rage and deep depression, lashing out at everyone and everything around me. I have myself to blame but right now, all I want is to drown in my misery. Even when something unexpected and good comes along, all I can do is push and push until I'm once more drowning all alone.</p> <p><b>Deryke</b></p> <p>I don't know what's come over me. Why does this disaster of a hockey player suddenly call to my heart and everything inside my body and mind? I mean, the world knows what's in his pants and I've never been even slightly turned on by that! Why now? Why him?</p> <p>Even when he's bratting so hard I want to break him, I can see that he acts the way he does because he's hurting somewhere deep inside. He won't let me in, but for some unknown reason, I can't let Maximus Latham go.</p> <p>He needs me. He needs someone to believe in him and not disappear the minute he messes up. He needs someone to love him for him, not for being the hockey god he is. Except I'm not sure I can reach him in time before he self-destructs.</p> <p>But damned if I'm not going to try.</p> <p>The Crease <i>is an LGBT+ story. For mature listeners.</i></p>";
