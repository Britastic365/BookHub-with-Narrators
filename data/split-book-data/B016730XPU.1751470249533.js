And she wants in, no matter what it takes. When a custom order comes up for a plus-sized red head, she volunteers for the job. Maybe pretending to be a sexual slave for Chase's camera will finally get her noticed by the two men she thinks will understand even her darkest cravings. </p> <p>Chase can't believe he and Murphy agreed to this deal. Eve is their employee, and they learned the hard way not to mix business with pleasure, no matter how sexy she is. Now, Eve wants to play in a game she thinks is pretend and he can't stop thinking of their rope against her creamy flesh. But once they start, there's no turning back. They'll have to have her. </p>";
