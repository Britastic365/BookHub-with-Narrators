She’s the second in charge of the Blackblood faction and is determined to make my life a living hell.</p> <p>I never could stand vampires, but now I’m addicted to their venom. Somehow, I need to find a way to survive because all thralls are destined for one thing—death.</p> <p>Then I meet Kyle, a vampire from another clan. I know straight away there’s something different about him. I’ve never hungered for anyone the way I do Kyle, which is terrifying because I’m a virgin.</p> <p>But I was right—Kyle isn’t all he seems. He works for the Dupont family, the vampires who rule over New Orleans, and his mission is to bring the Blackbloods down before they try to claim the Dupont’s territory.</p> <p>I know I shouldn’t trust my feelings for a vampire, but Kyle is my only chance for survival. The battle for New Orleans—and my heart—is going to be bloody....</p>";
