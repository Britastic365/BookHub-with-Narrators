Her embrace slays his soul.<br> <br> Dante Gabor has survived many things since becoming a vampire, but jumping from a plane and crash landing in the desert without a parachute was pushing it, even for him. To survive the relentless sun, he buries his broken body in its own sandy grave. But healing is painfully slow, and he's forced to rise and hunt for larger prey. Half mad with thirst, he's brought to his knees by the seductive taste of a lone female whose sweet blood heals his body, but leaves him craving still more.<br> <br> MINE.<br> <br> Laney Moss loves the Mojave desert that surrounds her home and hikes the upper trails often, prepared for anything she might run across. But nothing prepared her for the monster that comes with the setting sun to stalk her. In the moments before he attacks, one word crashes through her terrified mind—Vampire. She manages to get away, but he tracks the call of her blood and ignites a passion in her that frightens her nearly as much as it thrills her.<br> <br> Dante is left with no choice but to take her home to his secret lair.<br> Now, he just needs to convince her to stay.</p>";
