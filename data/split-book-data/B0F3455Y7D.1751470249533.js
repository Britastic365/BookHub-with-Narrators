A deadly drug is wreaking havoc among the Packs, and to make matters worse, Brock is blackmailing us to nominate him for a seat on the Wolf Council. If he wins, it’s not just us that he’ll be coming after—he wants every Shifter under his control. But this Alpha gig is not proving easy, and if Ryan and I can’t get past our issues and work out how to rule together, we could lose everything.</p> <p>Ryan</p> <p>Protecting Mai is a constant battle; my mate has made some dangerous enemies. With my wolf demanding I stop at nothing, and Mai fighting my every move, I have to navigate our new situation with care—something I’m not exactly good at. Only now we’re in a race against time, and if I don’t get this right, it could destroy Mai. There is only one thing I know for sure; I’ll do anything to protect my mate, my pack, my family.</p> <p>Listen to The Resolute Mate and enter the Shifter Realm today!</p>";
