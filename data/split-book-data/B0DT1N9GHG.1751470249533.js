window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Is Love Stronger Than Vengeance?<br> <br> <b>A Betrayal...</b><br> <br> Everything Poppy has ever believed in is a lie, including the man she was falling in love with. Thrust among those who see her as a symbol of a monstrous kingdom, she barely knows who she is without the veil of the Maiden. But what she does know is that nothing is as dangerous to her as him. The Dark One. The Prince of Atlantia. He wants her to fight him, and that's one order she's more than happy to obey. He may have taken her, but he will never have her.<br> <br> <b>A Choice....</b><br> <br> Casteel Da'Neer is known by many names and many faces. His lies are as seductive as his touch. His truths as sensual as his bite. Poppy knows better than to trust him. He needs her alive, healthy, and whole to achieve his goals. But he's the only way for her to get what she wants–to find her brother Ian and see for herself if he has become a soulless Ascended. Working with Casteel instead of against him presents its own risks. He still tempts her with every breath, offering up all she's ever wanted. Casteel has plans for her. Ones that could expose her to unimaginable pleasure and unfathomable pain. Plans that will force her to look beyond everything she thought she knew about herself–about him. Plans that could bind their lives together in unexpected ways that neither kingdom is prepared for. And she's far too reckless, too hungry, to resist the temptation.<br> <br> <b>A Secret...</b><br> <br> But unrest has grown in Atlantia as they await the return of their Prince. Whispers of war have become stronger, and Poppy is at the very heart of it all. The King wants to use her to send a message. The Descenters want her dead. The wolven are growing more unpredictable. And as her abilities to feel pain and emotion begin to grow and strengthen, the Atlantians start to fear her. Dark secrets are at play, ones steeped in the blood-drenched sins of two kingdoms that would do anything to keep the truth hidden. But when the earth begins to shake, and the skies start to bleed, it may already be too late.<br> <br> Adapted from the novel and produced with a full cast of actors, immersive sound effects and cinematic music!<br> <br> Performed by Katie Boothe, Stewart Crank, Torian Brackett, Wyn Delano, NJ Agwuna, Wayne LeGette, Dawn Ursula, David Cui Cui, Rayner Gabriel, Robb Moreira, Arden Wannall, Zura Johnson, Christopher Davenport, Crystal Lee Gregory Linnington, Alejandro Ruiz, Aure Nash, Troy Allan, Christopher Graybill, Bradley Foster Smith, Drew Kopas, Christopher Williams, Nanette Savard, Ken Jackson, and Karen Novack.</p>";
