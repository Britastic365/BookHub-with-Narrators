window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Langley Vaughn is in desperate need of a date. But not just any date. She's looking for a date to the wedding from hell. It isn't every day you're forced to be in the bridal party while your first love marries your archnemesis...otherwise known as the world's worst stepsister. The entire situation is a nightmare, and Langley is sick and tired of taking orders and forcing a fake smile. She needs to find a date who's not afraid of her family's money...someone willing to shake things up. Someone ready to go to war with the well-to-do. She needs someone who won't back down. </p> <p>Iker Alvarez would do anything and everything to get his hands on some quick cash. Thank goodness for a desperate, pretty little rich girl with too much money and her heart set on an outrageous scheme. Being in the right place at the right time might just be the answer to both of their prayers - and this smart soldier has never let a golden opportunity slide by. Only, he didn't plan on liking the blonde socialite as much as he does. He is totally unprepared for the pull he feels toward her, coupled with his growing desire to protect her from the vultures and villains living under the same roof. He knows he isn't the guy Langley can count on in the long run, but damn, if he doesn't want to do everything in his power to be that man. </p> <p><b>Contains mature themes.</b></p>";
