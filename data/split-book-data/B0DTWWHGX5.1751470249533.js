window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Note to self: never cast a spell you find on the internet.</b><br> Most people cry when they’re left at the altar. Me? I cast a spell to find the perfect man. But when a very bare and uh…impressive…incubus appears in my living room, I know I messed up. Serves me right for trying a spell I found on the internet!<br> <br> I’m both disappointed and relieved when Prax is summoned away. I think he’s gone for good, until I wake the next morning to my sexy incubus in nothing but an apron, making me breakfast in bed.<br> <br> But my magical screw-up has attracted more than one dirty-minded demon, and now I’m dealing with a bunch of dangerous and wildly inappropriate unwanted suitors. As we scramble to break the spell, I discover that Prax is genuine, funny, and super protective. Plus, our chemistry is off the charts! I’m falling for him. Hard.<br> <br> Too bad incubi aren’t known for forever-afters. Will I be able to nullify the spell in time? And will it cost me another broken heart?</p> <p><b><i>Signed in Incubus</i></b><b> is a standalone paranormal romance. Sweet, funny, &amp; ultra steamy. HEA guaranteed.</b></p>";
