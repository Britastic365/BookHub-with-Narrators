window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Brody</b></p> <p>I’m not the kind of guy you leave alone in your house. I’m especially not the kind you leave alone with your innocent daughter.</p> <p>My newest client doesn’t seem to care. He just wants his office remodeled. His college-aged daughter isn’t my usual type, but under those prim clothes and too big glasses, the sweet little bookworm hides a tight little body that’s tempting AF.</p> <p>I make her nervous. I should.</p> <p>I’m going to make her mine.</p> <p>She doesn’t know about men yet.... She’s about to learn.</p> <p><b>Megan</b></p> <p>Dad’s carpenter makes me feel things I don’t understand. I don’t have any experience with older guys like him, or any guys really. They look at me and see a quiet nerd. But this bad boy—I feel like he sees right through me. Like he knows the dirty fantasies that haunt my dreams. The things I do under the covers. He makes me needy and breathless. But I’m shy and awkward—what do I have to offer a man like him?</p> <p>Author’s Confession: This book is super sweet, unfailingly filthy, and the heroine is nerdilicious. And who doesn’t love a bad boy who’s good with his hands? Very good with his hands. Very, very good.</p>";
