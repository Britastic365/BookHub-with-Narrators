window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Rampage. Everyone loves him. He is Redemption's top heavyweight fighter and the biggest gossip in the gym. But he isn't the teddy bear everyone thinks he is. He's hiding a dark secret - and he hates himself for it. Twice a week, Rampage transforms into Master Jack, a notorious Dom only the most hard-core submissives will play with. How can he - a Southern gentleman, bred to respect and protect women - want to dominate them? But Penny Worthington wants him. Beneath her pearls, kitten heels, and prim British exterior beats a tortured heart - and Master Jack is the only one who can set her free. </p>";
