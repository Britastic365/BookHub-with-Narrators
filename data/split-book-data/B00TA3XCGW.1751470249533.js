window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>For centuries Dethan has been trapped in a fiery inferno for defying the gods and snatching the power of immortality. Condemned to have his battle-hardened body licked by flames only to regenerate and be consumed all over again, Dethan has lost all hope--until the goddess of conflict appears. She will release him from torment--if he'll use his power and strength as a warrior to raise an army and defeat a fierce enemy faction of gods. Free to live as a man once again, Dethan meets Selinda, heir to the throne of Hexis, and his thoughts quickly turn from the conquest of cities to the conquest of this headstrong beauty. </p> <p>Betrothed to a cruel, calculating power monger, Selinda needs a champion, and so Dethan enters into another bargain: If she will share her bed--and her body--with him, Dethan will save her city from destructive forces within and without. As the lovers ignite a searing passion, Dethan will risk all, even the wrath of the goddess of conflict, for a chance to make Selinda his forever. </p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
