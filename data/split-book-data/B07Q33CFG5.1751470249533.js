window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The survival of the last living dragons rests with me and my misfit friends. So... yeah. No pressure. Mind you, this whole thing would be easier if two of our number weren’t hell-bent on killing each other. Rayth and Nyx have both been hiding secrets for a very long time, but now they face a choice. Let go of their ugly pasts, or watch the future burn to the ground. </p> <p>We won’t be able to hide five hungry, growing dragons in the mountains forever. As soon as someone catches sight of them, every soldier in Utrea will be after us. And there’s no way we can fight for our dragons’ survival when we’re this busy fighting among ourselves. I’ve always been the queen of questionable life choices, but falling for four proud, stubborn, damaged men at the same time is a new benchmark even for me. What we’re building with the dragons - and each other - could be amazing beyond belief. It could also end in tragedy beyond measure. </p> <p><i>The Dragon Mistress,</i> by <i>USA Today</i> best seller R. A. Steffan, is a medium-burn fantasy romance series where the heroine doesn’t have to choose one person at the end. It is part of the Eburosi Chronicles, along with <i>The Horse Mistress</i> and <i>The Lion Mistress</i>. It’s not necessary to have listened to any of the other books in the series before starting the<i> Dragon Mistress</i> arc. </p>";
