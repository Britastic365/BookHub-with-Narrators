window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Still grieving the loss of her sister who died two years ago, the last thing Veronica \"Ronnie\" Locke needed was to lose her job at one of Chicago's finest restaurants and have to move back in with her parents. So when a window of opportunity opens for her - running a kitchen at a small Hawaiian hotel - she'd be crazy not to take it. The only problem is, the man running the hotel drives her crazy: Logan Shephard. It doesn't matter that he's got dark brown eyes, a tall, muscular build that's sculpted from daily surfing sessions, and a deep Australian accent that makes your toes curl. What does matter is that he's a grump, and he gets under Ronnie's skin like no one else. But the more time Ronnie spends on the island of Kauai, falling in love with the lush land and its carefree lifestyle, the closer she gets to Logan. And the closer she gets to Logan, the more she realizes she may have pegged him all wrong. Maybe it's the hot, steamy jungles or the invigorating ocean air, but soon their relationship becomes utterly intoxicating. There's just one major catch: the two of them together would incite a scandal neither Ronnie, nor her family, would ever recover from. Contains mature themes. </p>";
