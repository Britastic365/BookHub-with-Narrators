But, lately, it hasn’t been easy to see the glass half full. I’m weeks away from having a baby and trying really hard to marry the father and love of my life, and it’s been one catastrophic disaster after another.</p> <p>Between a waxing disaster (you know what I mean, ladies!) and the theft of our weddings bands, it appears our union is doomed. But ever the optimist, I’m determined to figure out who or what is trying to sabotage my Valentine's Day nuptials. And I’d better hurry up because as of right now, the wedding's off!</p> <p>Books in the Peculiar Mysteries series from <i>USA Today</i> best-selling author Renee George are laugh-out-loud, grip-the-edge-of-your-seat, and swoon-as-you-fall-in-love tales of mystery, humor, and romance that take place in the small (fictional) Ozark shifter town of Peculiar, Missouri.</p>";
