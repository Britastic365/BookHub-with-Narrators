A Kindred warrior with a beast inside...<br> Can Mia complete her mission?<br> Or is Trey Hitting the Target when he aims for her heart?</p> <p>Ormyu Five is the world divided in two<br> To the north, a police state ruled by the heavy hand of The EYE, which spies on its people constantly and keeps iron control over their lives.</p> <p>To the south lies Bountiful, a country of free thinkers bustling with trade and blessed with balmy weather. But those from the Northern Block never get to experience its temperate climate for the two halves of Ormyu Five are divided by an impenetrable wall of blue energy called the Great Barrier.</p> <p>Mia lives in the North and can’t remember a time when she wasn’t looking over her shoulder. Everyone spies on everyone else and reports to The Eye. It is a land of paranoia - a place of constant fear. Even Mia herself has been forced into the ranks of informants - she works as a nurse but also as a covert agent, reporting weekly to her Commandant in The EYE’s headquarters for new assignments. Imagine her surprise and dismay when she recognizes her new target - a huge male with a mane of golden brown hair and pale piercing eyes - as the one she has been dreaming of for months. </p> <p>Treygar is a rare Lei’on Kindred which means he keeps a hungry beast locked within himself. He came to Ormyu Five with his people, looking for a new genetic trade on the strangely divided planet. What he doesn’t expect is to start dream sharing with one of the inhabitants of the backwards world but that is exactly what happens. He wants to go and find the mysterious, curvy little female but before he can, he runs into her at the transport station. </p> <p>Mia is scared to death of the huge Kindred warrior. She’s been dreaming of him for months but she assumed It was just that - a dream. Even worse, he is the target she had been sent to the South to track…and possibly to kill. Can she keep herself from falling for Trey and complete her mission? Or is the big Kindred aiming for her heart, <i>Hitting the Target</i>?</p>";
