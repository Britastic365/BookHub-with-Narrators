window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I was gifted as a slave-bride to an alien giant. </p> <p>That's the start of my day. At least I have my guide dog, Kota, with me. I'd be lost without her...literally. </p> <p>Yes. I'm blind. </p> <p>And our new alien owner is kind enough that he's not holding me to the wife or slave deal even though that's what I was intended for. We've basically been dropped into a scene from <i>Little House on the Alien Prairie</i>, complete with his one-room cabin, and he's been the perfect gentleman. He's pretty great, and I'm actually starting to wish I could take him home with me. </p> <p>He doesn't know it yet, but the threat of him going into \"rut\" is no longer a deterrent....</p> <p><b><i>Contains mature themes.</i></b></p>";
