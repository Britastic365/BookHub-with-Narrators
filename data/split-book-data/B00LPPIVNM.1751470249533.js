window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The fourth in the Inside Out erotic romance series by <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Lisa Renee Jones, this steamy audiobook resolves Chris and Sara's relationship and leads into Mark's story. </p> <p>\"Chris and I have faced our demons and bared our souls to each other in Paris. Now that we are back home in San Francisco, I want to believe that nothing can tear us apart. Not Ava's accusations against me to the police, or Chris's fear that he will destroy me as he feels he did Amber. And not Mark, who was once too intimately a part of our lives, and who I can see crumbling inside out. He believes he is invincible, just as I want to believe Chris and I are invincible. We have to be invincible. We need each other too much for any other ending.\"</p>";
