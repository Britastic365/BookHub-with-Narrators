window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Adam Wright may be a self-made billionaire, but he's also a beast.</b></p> <p>Most children grow up hating a storybook villain. Based on the injuries that man inflicted on my brother, I grew up hating a real one. When he sort of kidnaps me and drags me back to his fairytale mansion, it feels like yet another clich√© antihero stunt.</p> <p>Here's the thing, though. Most villains don't weep real tears when they see you having a diabetic episode. They don't abandon their billion-pound empire so they can roll up their sleeves and pull your company back from the brink of bankruptcy. They don't put you first, care for you, at every single opportunity, dammit. Not in the storybooks I've read, anyway.</p> <p>My body succumbs first. It doesn't stand a chance. It's game over from the moment I wake to find him sleeping next to me, the Empire State Building tenting his pants.</p> <p>I despise myself. I shouldn't want him. Not when I know the despicable acts he's capable of. But when my heart starts to succumb, that's when I know I'm really in trouble. Because what if the villain I've loved to hate all these years is really my hero? And if indeed he is, how on earth will I persuade my brother of that?</p> <p>Unbind <i> is an age gap, enemies-to-lovers, billionaire romance that can be enjoyed on its own or as part of the Alchemy series. It has no third-act breakup, a big HEA, and a whole host of other tropes, too: sex club, reformed felon, forbidden love, \"we shouldn't be doing this,\" Beauty and the Beast vibes, brother's worst enemy, caregiving, twitchy palm, redemption arc, and a festive finish.</i></p>";
