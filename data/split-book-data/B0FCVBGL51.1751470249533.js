I should keep my distance.</i></b></p> <p>After barely escaping an abusive relationship, I came to Glacier Hollow, Alaska for peace. Running my café in a quiet mountain town was supposed to be a fresh start. No chaos. No heartbreak. Definitely no brooding former Navy SEALs with stormy blue eyes.</p> <p>Then Zeke MacAllister became our new sheriff.</p> <p>He’s gruff, guarded, and way too tempting for a man who clearly isn’t looking to be saved—or to save anyone else. But beneath the hard edges and military calm is a man I can’t stop thinking about.</p> <p>Just as sparks ignite between us, Zeke’s past crashes into our present, and I’m caught in the crossfire.</p> <p>He swore he wouldn’t let anyone in.<br> <br> I promised I’d never fall again.<br> <br> But some fires are impossible to fight.</p> <p><b><i>Protector of Talon Mountain</i></b><i> is the sizzling start to the Men of Talon Mountain series—where danger runs deep, the mountains keep secrets, and the hottest thing around might just be the man sworn to protect it all.</i></p>";
