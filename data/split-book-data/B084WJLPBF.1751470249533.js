window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I was born a monster. Cruelty ran in my veins like poison. It ran in the veins of every Vitiello man, passed on from father to son, an endless spiral of monstrosity. A born monster shaped into an even worse monster by my father’s blade and fists and harsh words. I was raised to become Capo, to rule without mercy, to dish out brutality without a second thought. Raised to break others. </p> <p>When Aria was given to me in marriage, everyone waited with baited breath to see how fast I’d break her like my father broke his women. How I’d crush her innocence and kindness with the force of my cruelty.</p> <p>Breaking her would have taken little effort. It came naturally to me.</p> <p>I was gladly the monster everyone feared. Until her.</p> <p>Author's note: <i>Bound by Honor</i> in Luca's POV.</p>";
