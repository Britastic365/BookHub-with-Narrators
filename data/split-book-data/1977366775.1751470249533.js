At age 18, I broke up with my boyfriend of almost one year because he wasn't who I thought he was. He further proved that when he put his hands on me. Two weeks later, my grandmother died. I moved to a new town with my last living relative, my older brother, Carbon, to finish my senior year of high school at Croftridge High.</p> <p>Then, I met Duke Jackson. One decision changed my life forever.</p> <p><b>Duke:</b> </p> <p>My life was in a good place. My sister was happy and healthy and I had my club.

I wanted more, and it was her.</p> <p>I almost had her, but I messed up and she walked away. I was angry and hurt, so I let her go, until the night she came crashing back into my life. Secrets were exposed and ghosts from the pasts resurfaced, but I refused to let her walk away from me a second time without a fight.</p> <p><b>Contains mature themes.</b></p>";
