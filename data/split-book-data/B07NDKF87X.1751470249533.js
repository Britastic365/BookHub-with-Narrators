window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Once upon a time there lived a Fairy. </p> <p>And not just your run of the mill kind of Fairy. The reincarnated Fairy Queen of Zanthia. <i>The Queen. </i>She was a modern woman - a human no less. Armed with a potty mouth, a firm grasp of every note in Michael Jackson’s song catalogue, and some friends in very high places, she was set. Yet this Queen wasn’t exactly sure she wanted the job. </p> <p>Fine...it’s me. </p> <p>I’ve been happily human for 30 years. Now I’m discovering I’m the reincarnated Fairy Queen over a land chock-full of freaks who want me dead. Awesome. However, I’ll admit the perks are pretty cool. I definitely have more magic in my little pinky than should be allowed by law in any universe. Not to mention, the love of my life is a Fairy so smokin’ hot, he makes Hell look like a Winter Wonderland. </p> <p>Problem is, my hotter-than-Hades Fairy is imprisoned in Zanthia for nefarious reasons I won’t go into, but now I must head back to that crap hole where I’m the Queen, and save the damn day. </p> <p>I won’t go alone. Nope. I’m packing a narcissistic Mini Elf, two ancient singing Vampyres who couldn’t carry a tune if their undead lives depended on it, and the sister of my imprisoned love, The Kev. For him, I vow to discover my truth. Consequently, I’m unsure if this truth is meant to save or destroy. What I do know? The alternative is unacceptable. </p> <p>Fairy tales are meant to have happy endings. I’m determined to make that a reality. </p> <p>Ready or not…here comes the freakin’ Fairy Queen.</p>";
