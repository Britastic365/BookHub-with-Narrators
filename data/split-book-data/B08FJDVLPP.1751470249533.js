window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>My heart hasn't beat in a 1,000 years. I haven't uttered a word in prison, and the guards keep their distance. If they get too close, they die - until at last, my magic binds my soul to another.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the person destined to save me is a night elf - the enemy of my kind. And yet, when I see her in the cell across from mine, an ember starts to burn in my chest. When we escape together down the palace walls, itâ€™s almost like I can feel again.</p> <p>As we journey to find the magic that will save us both, attraction simmers between us. But I keep my secrets close. Because, if she finds out what I am, she will find a way to kill me, even if it means sacrificing herself to do it.</p>";
