window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The Phoenix has risen. Things are getting hot.</b></p> <p>The quint is aligned, and as much as I hoped life would simplify once the five of us mated...it's a big \"Hells no\" on that. </p> <p>Don't get me wrong, the guys are great, with me, with each other. Sexy sparks are flying in every direction and having a front-row seat is enough to ignite me into flames - even if I wasn't a mythical firebird. </p> <p>Now we need to get ahead of the chaos coming at us. Open the portal. Unite the realms. Everyone lives happily ever after. </p> <p>But not everyone is as on board as they pretend. Who do we trust? Who's working against us? As we get closer to our goal, the opposing forces level up their attempts to keep us from fulfilling our destiny. Is it the Council? The Black Knight? Someone in the upper levels of the Fae Concealment Office? Whoever it is, they must be stopped before someone I love gets killed.</p> <p><b>This is book four in a steamy reverse harem paranormal romance series. Expect sexy polyamorous situations (MMMFM), rollicking action, ongoing storylines, and shifter lovers who find what they need from not only their queen but each other as well. Med-burn, med angst, vivid sexual content, and language.</b></p>";
