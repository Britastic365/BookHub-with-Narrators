Survival depends on your ability to kick ass and take names.</p> <p>Radiation transforms select humans into mutated creatures who are banished from society - Enders. The males are libido-less wild animals incapable of satisfying the females, who are hot, forward and badass.</p> <p>Cutter has kept to himself for 10 years, avoiding the conflict with a sharp tongue, stiff drink and his two best friends, his six-shooters, Alpha and Beta. But the perils of the wastelands won't leave him the hell alone. Two sisters, one human and one Ender, offer him a generous salary to protect them as they set off on a doomed peace mission. It's an offer he can't refuse, even as he knows there's no chance in hell of their succeeding.</p> <p>All the odds are stacked against them, but Cutter soon learns his destiny is to be more than just a bodyguard, even if it involves forging together a crack team of gorgeous human and Ender operatives who will make the insane mission much more pleasurable.</p> <p>Warning: Contains a harem.</p>";
