window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Find out what happens when a college graduate meets a sexy billionaire in a coffee shop and discovers a chemistry that burns hotter than a steaming latte!<br> <br> Derek</b><br> For as long as I can remember, building an empire has been my only focus. Most people think of me as the all-powerful billionaire, intimidating, and unyielding. I like keeping that wall between me and the rest of the world.</p> <p>Valentina De Cordoba is the breath of fresh air I never saw coming. She’s the beautiful stranger sitting in the corner of Cafe Trieste. I feel alive when she’s near. Even when she doesn’t know she’s the reason the coffee shop has become my safe haven.</p> <p>Month after month, I stay away because I can’t drag her down into the dark world my life has become. At best, I could break her heart. At worst, I could destroy her and everything she holds dear.</p> <p>But then I see her crying. Those brown eyes filled with tears make something inside my chest crack open. Consequences be damned, I break the one rule keeping me alive…I get involved.</p> <p><b>Valentina</b><br> My lists are how I get things done. The most important task on my crumpled piece of paper right now is to find a home for my son and me.</p> <p>As a single mom, I don’t have time for complications or distractions of any kind. The playboy billionaire offering me a place to lease would fall under both of those categories.</p> <p>But when my well-outlined plan goes up in smoke, I find myself with no choice but to accept the handsome stranger's help. So what if he's hotter than hot. So what if my broody landlord is now also my new neighbor? So what if I fall?</p>";
