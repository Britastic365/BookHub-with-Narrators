window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It was supposed to be a one-night stand; a completely anonymous hookup with no strings attached. When that same girl shows up for recruit training and my best friend introduces her as his little sister, however, things get... complicated. Because even though I agreed to a one-night stand, I can’t get Quinn Jacobsen out of my head. It isn’t long before the two of us start sneaking around, and the deeper we get into our web of lies, the more it starts to unravel.</p> <p>ALPHA JAX is book three in the Six-Pack Series, a collection of interconnected paranormal romance books that tell the stories of six Alpha werewolves and the strong-willed women who bring them to their knees. This book contains mature content and themes, steamy scenes, and frequent use of profanity. While this book can be listened to as a standalone, this series is best enjoyed in order.</p>";
