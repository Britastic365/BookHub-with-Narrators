window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Welcome to Las Vegas, home of the Sin City Collectors. The job description is easy: Bring the offending supernatural in to the Boss and don't ask any questions. </p> <p><i>Queen of Hearts, Vol. 1</i> </p> <p>Feline shifter Claudette Marchon traded life as a showgirl to become a Sin City Collector, giving up the glamour to earn some serious cash in order to buy her own business. Mission accomplished, she now runs a pawn shop specializing in gems and jewelry. </p> <p>Life is good until a Collection job requiring her specific skill set lures her back in. The Queen of Hearts, a museum-worthy ruby and diamond necklace has been stolen from the Boss's private collection and she's his last hope to do what two other Collectors have already failed to do. Bring in the necklace. And the thief. </p> <p>But gargoyle Jason Tennant isn't quite the dangerous criminal Claudette expects. In fact, he's not a thief at all. He's former Special Ops and being set up by the real mastermind, forcing her to decide between the man she's falling for and the man she works for. Proving Jason innocent may risk the Boss's wrath, but Claudette's heart says it's a gamble worth taking. </p> <p><i>Dead Man's Hand, Vol. 2</i> </p> <p>Demi-goddess and muse Seraphina Kostos has been tasked with bringing her employer's wayward teenage daughter home. Not the hardest job Seraphina's ever had - until her boss calls in a favor in the form of extra help. The man who arrives is unlike any she's ever encountered. </p> <p>Sin City Collector Ares rarely goes on typical Collections. Mostly because his skill set involves taking lives, not saving them. As the son of a vampire and a grim reaper, his touch holds the ability to reap souls. Sure, it makes for a lonely existence, but he's learned to deal with that. Or has he? </p> <p>Beautiful Seraphina has him questioning everything he's ever known. Living the rest of his life alone suddenly seems impossible. But what kind of future is there with a woman he can't touch or hold or kiss? </p> <p><i>Double or Nothing, Vol. 3</i> </p> <p>Gage Hudson is a vampire on a mission. All he wants - all he's ever wanted - is to locate the vampire who killed his brother and exact his revenge. Even if that means losing his job as a Gotham City Collector. And he knows what loss feels like, because his desire for revenge has already cost him the love of his life. </p> <p>Sin City Collector and pixie Minka Winslow has revenge fantasies of her own and they all involve Gage. When he walked out on her with no explanation, she took the heat for the Collection he ruined. Fortunately for him, she's put that part of her life behind her. </p> <p>At least until the two are forced to work together to stay alive. When an enemy from their past returns to threaten them, they have no choice but to reconcile long enough to survive. Then new information changes everything. Just how much will they gamble to make things work this time? </p>";
