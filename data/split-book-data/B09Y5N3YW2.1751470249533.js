window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Experience the paranormal like never before...</b></p> <p>\"The gateway is open.\"</p> <p>These cryptic words wake college student Jess Ballard from a terrifying dream into an even more terrifying reality. Jess’ life has never been what anyone would call easy; doing damage control in the wake of your nomadic, alcoholic mother doesn't exactly make for a storybook childhood.</p> <p>But now, her world has fallen apart just when it should be coming together: her mother gone—dead under mysterious circumstances; her life uprooted to stay with estranged relatives she’s never met; and there’s something odd about some of the people she’s been meeting at school: They’re dead.</p> <p>Aided by Tia, her neurotic roommate, and Dr. David Pierce, a ghost-hunting professor, Jess must unravel the mystery behind her hauntings. But the closer she gets to the truth, the more danger shadows her every move. An ancient secret, long buried, is about to claw its way to the surface, and nothing can prepare Jess for one harrowing truth...her encounters with the world of the dead are only just beginning.</p> <p><i>Spirit Legacy</i> is the first installment in the thrilling paranormal series The World of the Gateway by E. E. Holmes.</p>";
