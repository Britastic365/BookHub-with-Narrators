We defeated the dragon. I thought we’d won. But we’ve ended up losing so much more….</p> <p>Cain’s severely wounded, and I don’t know how to save him. Losing him shouldn’t bother me, but it does. A lot. </p> <p>Elias and Dorian have a plan: seek out help from people who wield the darkest and cruelest of magic. We soon find that the only one with enough power to bring the Prince of Hell back from death is a master of death itself. But nothing can be done for free and the price has us traveling across the world and facing a slew of new dangers, ones none of us are prepared for.</p> <p>Even with everything shot to hell, the demons remain a constant temptation I don’t need. Being with them only seems to fan the flames, but letting me go depends on finding all of Hell’s relics.</p> <p>And if I’m being honest, I’m not sure what I’ll do once my soul is freed.</p> <p><i>The thrilling and seductive adventure continues.
