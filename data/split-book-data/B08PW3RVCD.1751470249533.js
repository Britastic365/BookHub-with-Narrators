window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>If I don’t find an outlet for this rage, I’m going to lose my shit.</p> <p>Lily is off-limits. Ever since we got back to Fortune Academy, it’s been too dangerous to get anywhere near her. For her sake, I keep my distance.</p> <p>The rage demon that’s corrupted our mate-circle has gotten under my skin…and he knows it.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p><b>Dante </b></p> <p>“Are you feeling sorry for yourself again?” a male voice teased, filtering into the room as the Dark Mage walked right past my wards.</p> <p>“Go away, Hendrik,” I growled. </p> <p>Hendrik stepped out of the shadows as he peeled off his coat. “I could use another session,” he said, grinning as he gave the offer to spar a double-meaning. </p> <p>“Last time was a mistake,” I snapped as I went back to the vampire stake I was working on. I sliced my dagger over the tip, sending a tendril of wood falling to the ground. “We’re just being influenced by the demon.”</p> <p>“I kind of like it,” he admitted as he ran his fingers over the weapons on the wall. He glanced at me when he picked a short fighting stick. “Do you think you can beat me this time?”</p> <p>A grin spread across my face as the thrill of violence surged through me. I took on his taunt, wasting no time with my attack, but the Dark Mage was ready for me and shoved me hard enough against the wall to snap a rib. I released a breath and went still, letting the bone knit back into one piece.</p> <p>“Do you feel it?” he asked, his breath hot on my cheek.</p> <p>“I…don’t know what you’re talking about,” I lied. My strength had its limits and the Dark Mage knew it. I needed time to regenerate, or magic. Neither of which I had access to right now.</p> <p>He continued to wear me out, forcing me to strain against him to catch tiny gulps of air to stay conscious.</p> <p>“Concede, or I won’t be able to stop,” he warned. </p> <p>The dark edge of his voice said he needed one of two things right now to take off the demon’s edge. </p> <p>Murder…or sex, and I had a feeling I knew which one he wanted from me.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p><i>“Burn in Hell” is Episode 1 in the Fortune Academy Underworld Episodic series.
