window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Welcome to Nocturne Falls, the town that celebrates Halloween 365 days a year. The tourists think it's all a show: the vampires, the werewolves, the witches, the occasional gargoyle flying through the sky. But the supernaturals populating the town know better. </p> <p>Living in Nocturne Falls means being yourself. Fangs, fur, and all. </p> <p>Willa Iscove, fae jeweler, has her first stalker. Really, he's just one of her lovesick customers. The ring she crafted to help him find new love has backfired, making Willa the object of his affections. In a bid to rid herself of her amorous client, Willa makes a wish in the Nocturne Falls fountain using the piece of opal in her pocket and in doing so, unknowingly conscripts as her guardian the sexy gargoyle on duty. </p> <p>Former Army Ranger and gargoyle Nick Hardwin has some serious suspicions about the pretty fae who just invoked the ancient pact for protection. Her kind have been at odds with his kind for ages. Now she wants his help? He's determined to figure out what she's up to. Which won't be a hardship considering how much fun she is to be around. And kiss. </p> <p>But then her stalker turns out to be the tip of the iceberg and things go really wrong, really fast. When they're both kidnapped, Willa is forced to make a hard decision. The life of her family or the freedom of the man she's fallen for? </p>";
