Somewhere underneath all of that handsomeness, there lies a monster.</p> <p>And if anyone can sense a monster, it's me.</p> <p>I understand cruelty. I've lived and breathed it my entire life. I existed on the \"charity\" of others until I realized that it wouldn't be enough. My demons would soon be set free. They were coming back for me and to be ready for them—to be ready for him—I needed to make myself invincible.</p> <p>But it's not enough. If I'm going to survive, then I need to make an alliance with a monster of my own: Abel Frazier.</p> <p><b>Contains mature themes.</b></p>";
