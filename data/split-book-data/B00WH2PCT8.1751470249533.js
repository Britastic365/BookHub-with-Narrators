window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Maddox Jamenson almost lost his mate before he knew she existed, but his life is now exactly how he'd dreamed it. The war with the Centrals is over, and his family is healing one day at a time. Ellie is reveling in the simple perfection that is her life and family now, but that doesn't mean she can shed the self-doubts and concerns that come with being a new mother, mate, and Redwood. </p> <p>When a disturbance in their quiet life threatens to ruin everything they've fought for, Maddox and Ellie will not only have to learn to rely on each other more than ever but find within themselves the power to forgive. </p> <p>Author's note: This is a novella set after book seven to give you a taste of Maddox and Ellie. It is best that you have already immersed yourselves in the Redwood Pack world; however even new listeners will enjoy a glimpse of one of the Redwood's favorite couples. </p>";
