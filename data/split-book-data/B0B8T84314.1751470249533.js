By night, I blow off steam at an underground fight club. I never thought the pandemic would bring Deanna Delgado back into my lifeâ€”the woman who ghosted me three years ago after one unforgettable night. But the brewery needs a miracle to survive.

There's so much more to Angel than he lets on. Is he the man I can trust with my body and my heart? Or is he just another lost cause?</p> <p>\"Delightfully raunchy, yet tender and loving.
