I can’t give her what she needs, but there’s one in the village who can…<br> Gabriel is tall, strong, and handsome—all things I once was. As my days grow lonelier, I accept that I need them—<i>both</i> of them.<br> They’ll act out every dark, twisted fantasy my monstrous form prevents me from participating in.<br> And with any luck, they’ll grow to enjoy their new prison.<br> But the closer we become, the more the roses wither and die. <i>The castle is changing</i>.
