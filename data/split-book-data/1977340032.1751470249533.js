So when a new guy swans in and thinks he'll get a patch in no time just because he's got friends in high places, Jake is there to stand in his way.</p> <p>Only that the guy is older, more experienced, drives a Harley, and has the kind of boots Jake craves to lick. But he won't. Because he only f--ks patches.</p> <p>Vars is ready to find a new home in the Kings of Hell MC after a messy relationship led him straight to hell. In comparison, the pretty, blue-eyed prospect could be just the pleasant rebound he needs.</p> <p>The boy is a brat, but that could be amended with a firm hand and a gag. If only Jake was ready to admit to his submissive needs, Vars would gladly take him under his wing. That is, until he finds out something inhuman resides inside of Jake. Vars didn't cheat death only to call out to it again.</p> <p>But stuck together in one room, keeping each other's secrets, they might just have to become allies, no matter how unwilling. Because if there is something Vars can't resist, it's a boy with pleading eyes.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
