window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>She broke their laws. Now, he has come to punish her...</p> <p>In my human settlement on the hostile plains of Dakkar, I am an outcast, a strange girl orphaned since birth, alone, and dreaming of a life I don't have. I hunt to survive, though it is forbidden, though it breaks the strict Dakkari laws that we all must follow.</p> <p>When my desperate actions catch the attention of a Dakkari horde king - a cold, powerful, and merciless warrior leader, with eyes like flint and a body like steel - he seeks to punish me...and he succeeds.</p> <p>But then he does the unexpected.</p> <p>Instead of taking my life, he claims me as his own.</p> <p>He steals me from my village and brings me back to his battle-bred horde. There, I warm his bed. I make bargains with him on starry, cold nights. I look into his grey eyes and see not a monster, but a demon king who captures my soul.</p> <p>But demons have a way of never letting go...and as the cold season descends upon Dakkar, I begin to wonder if I even want him to, even when it hurts.</p> <p><i>Claimed by the Horde King</i> is a full-length SFR novel with an HEA. It is the second book of the Horde Kings of Dakkar series.</p>";
