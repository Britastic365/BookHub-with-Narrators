window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Deacon has an ugly history, a history that broke him, leaving him a ghost of a man. Out of necessity he left the normal world to descend into the criminal world and found he fit. So he stayed. Cold as ice and living off the grid, Deacon has no intention to connect, not with anyone. Then he returns to some remote cabins in the Colorado Mountains and finds they have new owners. One of them is Cassidy Swallow, a young woman willing to work hard to live her quiet dream in a house by a river surrounded by aspen and pine. </p> <p>Suddenly Deacon finds he's at war. Cassidy's pull for him to connect is strong. He fights it, but he loses, always coming back for more. But when he does, he gives her nothing. From the first time she sees him, Cassidy knows Deacon is dead inside. She knows heâ€™s the kind of man who could destroy a woman. But one night when Deacon's control slips, Cassidy takes a chance. He might break her. He also might be her dream come true. </p>";
