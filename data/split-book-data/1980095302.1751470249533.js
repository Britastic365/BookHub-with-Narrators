window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A fast-paced series starter perfect for fans of <i>Aru Shah and the End of Time</i> and filled with adventure, mythology, and an unforgettable trio of friends. </p> <p>On Emblem Island, all are born knowing their fate. Their lifelines show the course of their life, and an emblem dictates how they will spend it. </p> <p>Twelve-year-old Tor Luna was born with a leadership emblem, just like his mother. But he hates his mark and is determined to choose a different path for himself. So, on the annual New Year's Eve celebration, where Emblemites throw their wishes into a bonfire in the hopes of having them granted, Tor wishes for a different power. </p> <p>The next morning Tor wakes up to discover a new marking on his skin...the symbol of a curse that has shortened his lifeline, giving him only a week before an untimely death. There is only one way to break the curse, and it requires a trip to the notorious Night Witch. </p> <p>With only his village's terrifying, ancient stories as a guide and his two friends Engle and Melda by his side, Tor must travel across unpredictable Emblem Island, filled with wicked creatures he only knows through myths, in a race against his dwindling lifeline.</p>";
