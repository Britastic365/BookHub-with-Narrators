window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Hate at first sight couldn’t possibly exist, right? </p> <p>That’s what Grace Buchanan thought, before her useless car stranded her on the side of a deserted road just inside the Green Valley city limits. </p> <p>When Tucker Haywood — tall and handsome and full of southern charm— shows up to help, her reaction to him is the strongest thing she’s ever felt in her life, and it makes no freaking sense. </p> <p>It doesn’t make much sense to Tucker, either. Not why she hates him, or why he finds her so intriguing. He knows well enough that Grace is moving to Green Valley for a fresh start, not to distract him when he’s got no room for something like her in his life. </p> <p>The complications between them are endless, but that doesn’t stop her definitely not love-at-first-sight feelings from changing into something else entirely. </p> <p>Grace and Tucker are about to learn the hard way that in Green Valley, hating someone has never tasted so sweet. </p> <p><i>Batter of Wits is a full-length contemporary romance, can be listened to as a standalone, and is book five in the Donner Bakery series, Green Valley World, Penny Reid Book Universe.</i></p>";
