window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>James</b> </p> <p>She was my sin and my temple. I both worshipped and defiled there. Gloried and desecrated. Revered and debased. </p> <p>I've been remade four times in my life. </p> <p>It is a distinct feeling. Impossible to mistake. The very marked sensation of being unraveled and reknit into a new thing, a new person. It can be good or bad, helpful or harmful, but above all, it is unstoppable. </p> <p>I was remade when my parents died, went from a happy childhood into navigating a very dark world, with endless responsibilities, surrounded by enemies, and despairingly alone. </p> <p>It happened again at the hands of a cowardly predator. I'd become angrier with that one, more cynical, and it undoubtedly turned me into the kinky f**k I was today. </p> <p>The third happened swiftly. One day I looked up into a pair of pale blue eyes and saw the other half of my soul. Checkmate. I went from a completely controlled existence, a life where I made every decision with cold calculation, to a man overcome with feelings and emotions that were foreign but somehow wonderful. </p> <p>And all too soon after that cataclysmic change was this fourth one, this one where I begged a God I'd never entertained to spare the life of a woman that I could not live without. </p> <p><i>Mr. Beautiful</i> is a continuation of the Up in the Air series, told from the male point of view, with POVs from James, Stephan, Tristan, Frankie, and Akira. </p> <p>This book is intended for readers 18 and up. </p>";
