Or so it appears. </p> <p>Appearances can be deceiving. </p> <p>The night I met Gracie Morgan was the night that my life changed forever. I saved her that night, but it feels like she's been the one saving me ever since. <i>(Hawk)</i> </p> <p>Hawk didn't just save me that night. He took me home with him and his family made me one of their own. I felt safe with them and quickly began to fall for the man that was my guardian angel. <i>(Gracie) </i></p> <p>The events of that night have not faded from anyone's memory. The Angel's Halo MC delivered their own vengeance against the guys that had hurt Gracie, and the ones that just stood by and did nothing. </p> <p>But they didn't realize they were dealing with a sociopath like Kevin Samson. Now no one was safe.... </p>";
