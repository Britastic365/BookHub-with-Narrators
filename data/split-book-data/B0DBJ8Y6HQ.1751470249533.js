window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Does Cupid have a nice list? Never mind. Forget it. I'm breaking up with Valentine's Day.</b></p> <p>It started innocently enough with a harmless inquiry about a cute guy at a coffee shop. The goal was to get back into the romance game. The search turned into a social media frenzy. #DesperatelySeekingDane was not available. Talk about a buzzkill.</p> <p>Just when I thought things couldn't become more dramatic, a TV production company reached out to me as a last-minute contestant in a dating contest because of my five minutes of online fame. It was an instant yes because one of the three bachelors was a major movie star and my lifelong crush.</p> <p>Here's the twist: I'm matched with the third-place prize, a daredevil hockey player I can't stand. Let's just say we have a brief but storied history involving shrill whistles, spilled coffee, and a bloody incident in an elevator.</p> <p>However, it turns out the date is only the opening act. We end up in each other's debt, resulting in a meet-the-parents situation. But we kind of hit it off. As things heat up between us, sparks fly and the ice begins to melt. Can I be falling for the guy I loathe?</p> <p><i>This is a clean, sweet, closed-door hockey romcom with lots of sweet kisses and a happily ever after.</i></p>";
