Sharp fangs and eyes that held an unearthly red glow. He had paw-like hands tipped with claws and horns that arched back from his inhuman face.</p> <p>I was to live with him, to be his in every way—all ways—he saw fit.</p> <p>I was to be his wife, and so I offered myself up as the proverbial sacrifice to the very devil himself.</p> <p>I just didn’t expect to enjoy being with a monster as much as I did.</p>";
