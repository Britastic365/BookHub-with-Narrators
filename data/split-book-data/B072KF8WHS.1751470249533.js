She scrapes by as best as she can in a hard, dangerous world. When she runs afoul of the law, she's left as bait in dragon territory. She only has one chance to survive - to somehow tame a dragon and get it to obey her. </p> <p>Except the dragon that finds her is as wild and brutal as any other...and he's not interested in obeying. What he is interested in is a mate. </p> <p>Contains mature themes. </p>";
