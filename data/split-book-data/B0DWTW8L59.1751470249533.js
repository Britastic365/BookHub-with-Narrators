When I looked into my Joy's eyes, I wanted to give her the stars, moons, and the sky wrapped up with a big fat ass bow. So, for her, I would go to war to make sure Tweety had no part in touching her ever again.</p> <p>My son's life was touched because of a man who doesn't understand that I'm at the top. Now, I'm about to touch every person he has ever loved until my hands are wrapped around his throat. For my seeds, I will shed blood.</p>";
