window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>They shouldn't want me. I rejected them and ran… and I'll find a way to escape again.</b></p> <p>I grew up knowing three important facts. One, my parents hated Nexus shifters. Two, I was taught everyone should be scared of me, and they should be. Three, I'm a monster.</p> <p>I'm a Nexus, a powerful shifter bonded to five other souls… only I rejected them all at the mating ceremony and ran away with my parents when I was fifteen.</p> <p>After five years on the run, I've finally been found. My Nexus mates dragged me back to the biggest pack community in the mountains of Scotland, where they'll make sure I follow each of their rules and never let me out of their sight while they torment me for breaking the bond.</p> <p>Onyx, with his charming smiles and pretty suits, hides the true alpha lurking within. Aleksander, with his unforgettable hazel eyes and deadly secrets, wants to ruin me. The twins, Hollis and Rhodes, capture ladies' hearts like it's an art form. One wants to break mine in the name of revenge. And finally, Finnegan. He is the biggest threat to the Nexus shifter race, and he hates me the most.</p> <p>They are dangerous alpha shifters who have powers from the Wolf Gods, and I'm the reject who broke their hearts, tore out the bond between us, and left them alone.</p> <p>Every moment I spend with them is dangerous…</p> <p>They don't know the monster lurking under my skin, begging to come out to play. If they keep pushing… it won't be stopped.</p> <p>Then there will be nothing left.</p> <p>Starlight Mates<i> is a dark romantasy with men who growl more than speak. You can expect tropes like who did this to you, touch her and die, rejected mates, forced proximity, and why-choose.</i></p>";
