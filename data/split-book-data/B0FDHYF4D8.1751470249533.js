window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>The King’s Maiden</i> is first in a series and ends on a CLIFFHANGER. It is a slow burn, modern-day retelling, loosely based on the legend of King Arthur. Aspects of the lore will be layered throughout the entire series, but it is not a fantasy romance. The FMC will eventually end up with more than one love interest, and the ultimate goal is for all the characters to live and love without limits, so please check the content warnings on the author's website.<br> <b> <br> Camelot Court is a world of secrets. Nothing is as it seems, and to join The Quest, one must </b><b><i>Pledge with Trust...</i></b><br> <br> Twenty-five thousand dollars to let some entitled, rich guy boss me around for a month?<br> <br> <i>Sign. Me. Up.</i><br> <br> Most days, I did that for free and called it being female. But it turns out the rumors circulating campus are true. A secret society wants to pay me for <i>their</i> privilege.<br> <br> Life has thrown me nothing but lemons since I lost my father. Crippling student loans. Unpaid medical bills. Overdue rent. Enter The Quest, the solution to all my problems.<br> <br> To win it, I have to become a Maiden,<br> Navigate a snake pit of secrets and betrayal,<br> And fight to resist temptation, all for the chance at a fresh start.<br> <br> Submitting to D’Arthur University’s brotherhood of Knights won’t be an easy feat. Camelot Court’s most notorious members will test my honor and my limits.<br> <br> But to the victor goes the spoils…<br> <br> And The Quest is one game I can’t afford to lose.<br> <br> <b>Cover by Jay Aheer @simplydefinedart<br> Audiobook produced by Audio Sorceress</b></p>";
