And now we want her back.</b></p> <p><b>McKay</b></p> <p>I wasn’t the one who broke her but I played my part. She came to us when she was 10. I raised her. I loved her. I taught her how to survive in a world of evil men. But it wasn’t enough.</p> <p><b>Adam</b></p> <p>I wasn’t the one who saved her but I did my best. She needed me as much as I needed her. Bought and paid for on the auction block. But not for the reasons you think. She was my weapon.</p> <p><b>Donovan</b></p> <p>I wasn’t the one who lied to her, but I hid her truth. She was broken before I got there. Wild and angry. Defiant and bratty. But she trusted me most. She loved me best. So I set her free.</p>";
