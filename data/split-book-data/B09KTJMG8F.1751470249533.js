window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A magical mercenary is crowned a queen of the Otherworld - an honor that could cost her life - in the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author's paranormal thriller.</p> <p>Eugenie Markham is a shaman for hire, paid to bind and banish creatures from the Otherworld. But after her last battle, she's also become queen of the Thorn Land. It may sound nice, but her kingdom is in tatters, her love life is in chaos, and Eugenie is eager to avoid a prophecy about her firstborn destroying mankind. Now young girls are disappearing from the Otherworld, and no one - except Eugenie - is willing to find out why.</p> <p>Eugenie has spilled plenty of fey blood in her time, but this enemy is shrewd, subtle, and nursing a very personal grudge. And the men in her life aren't making things any easier. Her boyfriend Kiyo is preoccupied with his pregnant ex, and sexy fey king Dorian always poses a dangerous distraction. With or without their help, the reluctant queen has a sworn duty to uphold, even if it means facing the darkest and deadliest side of her nature.</p>";
