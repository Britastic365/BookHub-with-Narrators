window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Zanders: Chicago hockey isn't complete without meâ€”everyone's favorite player to hate. I know my role, and I play it well. In fact, I thoroughly enjoy spending the majority of my game time in the penalty box before leaving the arena with a new girl on my arm each night.</p> <p>What I don't like is the new flight attendant on our team's private plane. She works for me, not the other way around. But I'll be sure to remind her of that, and I can guarantee, by the end of the season, she'll be begging to quit her job.</p> <p>But every road trip blurs the lines, and I can't quite figure out if I keep pushing that flight attendant call button in order to push her buttons or if it's more than that.</p> <p>Stevie: I've been a flight attendant for years. I thought I'd see it all, but when my new job lands me onboard working for the most egotistical and self-righteous diva in the NHL, I start to second guess everything. Including the promise I made to myself of never hooking up with an athlete again . . . no matter how annoyingly tempting he may be.</p> <p>Zanders is unfiltered, unapologetic, and too attractive for his own good. He loves his image, but I hate everything about it.</p> <p>Everything but him.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
