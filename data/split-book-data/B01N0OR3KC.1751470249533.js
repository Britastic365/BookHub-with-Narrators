window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In a spellbinding new Argeneau novel from <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Lynsay Sands, a dangerous rescue is just the beginning of red-hot adventure. </p> <p>Ever since Domitian Argenis recognized Sarita as his life mate, he's been waiting for the perfect moment to claim her. Those fantasies did <i>not</i> include him being chained to a table in a secret lab or both of them being held hostage by a mad scientist. Somehow, they have to escape. </p> <p>Sarita has seen some crazy things as a cop, but nothing to rival Domitian. A vampire? Seriously? But his healing ability, his incredible powers, and their mind-blowing physical connection - none of it should be possible, yet her body knows differently. Now, not only do they have to save each other, but other innocent lives are at stake. Failure is not an option, for Sarita intends that Domitian show her exactly what an eternity of pleasure feels like. </p>";
