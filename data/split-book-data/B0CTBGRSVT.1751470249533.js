window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Spending seven minutes in a closet with a stranger has to be the stupidest dare I’ve ever agreed to until it becomes seven minutes in heaven.</b></p> <p>‘Back to Highschool’ frat parties aren’t my scene. But when the games start, and I’m dared to join in, I can’t resist.</p> <p>You see, dares have always provided an excuse to be a crazy and exciting version of me. The kind of girl who steps into a closet wearing a little black dress and a blindfold, with no idea what to expect.</p> <p>As the door closes, not one, not two, but three bodies press against me. Six hands roam over places that haven’t seen action for months. Seven minutes pass in a flash, and when time is up, I stagger out of the closet a disheveled, satisfied, and intrigued mess.</p> <p>Because with just a glimpse of one tattooed hand, I know who achieved the unachievable. My stepbrothers knew how to blow my mind when no one had ever managed it before.</p> <p>I’m mad as hell and freaked out at what we’ve done. I tell myself it’s all kinds of wrong, but my body won’t stop reminding me of just how right it felt.</p> <p>I shouldn’t want more, but I do.</p> <p>But without another dare, there’s no way I’ll be brave enough to find out if they can send me to heaven again.</p> <p>Or will I?</p> <p>HUGE DARE is a stepbrother reverse harem romance with a happy ever after ending. It’s book 1 in the Beyond Huge Series, standalone romances with characters who continue to make appearances!</p>";
