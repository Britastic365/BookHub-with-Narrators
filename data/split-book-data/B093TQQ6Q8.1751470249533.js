window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The Albertini Family is back in this holiday romance!</p> <p>Quint Albertini likes his life as a smokejumper and search and rescue expert. He has his dog, his friends, and his freedom. He’s had it with women who can’t commit or who want him to change, and now all he has to do is dodge the family match-makers so he can live his peaceful life when he’s not leaping head first into danger.</p> <p>When Heather Davis gets trapped on a mountain during a wild winter storm, her carefully laid plans of safety and security go right out the snow filled window. Her saviors, dog and man, quickly capture her heart, even though she’s trying to remain under the radar from a disastrous past that seems to keep coming for her.</p> <p>While Quint and Heather try to ignore the blazing hot attraction between them, the Albertini family has no intention of letting a possible romance fizzle out - especially during the magical holiday season.</p>";
