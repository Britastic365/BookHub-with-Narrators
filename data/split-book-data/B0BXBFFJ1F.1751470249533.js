window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Destiny or desire: where does your allegiance lie?</b></p> <p>I am told my union to the crowned prince will determine the fate of the kingdom, but it isn’t my betrothed who haunts my dreams. It’s the half-breed prince who stands at his side.</p> <p>He is darkness and sin, and when he whispers promises of wickedness in my ear, I crave a man who I can’t have. Every thought I have is treasonous. The way my hands ache to touch him deceitful. Even my dreams make me a traitor to the kingdom I am sworn to protect.</p> <p>But when the kingdom is attacked, I am forced to make choices I’m not prepared for. Our lies and deception are entangled in the shadows and stars, and as they unravel so shall my fate. Betray a kingdom or betray my heart.</p> <p><i>A Kingdom of Stars and Shadows</i> is book one in the Stars and Shadows series, and it ends in a cliffhanger.</p>";
