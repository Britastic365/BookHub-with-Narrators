window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>MM encounters to shake Valhalla.</b></p> <p>Oli is not happy with his lot in life as a thrall, a slave to the noble family he has served since birth. If he believed in the old gods, he would curse them to their faces that a thrall is the most he could ever be. Few even worship the gods anymore, yet Oli is tasked with tending to their altar at the foot of the oldest tree in the nearby wood—where he is happy to defile it whenever the noble family's son wants him on his knees.</p> <p>After his most recent tryst, however, he learns how real the gods are.</p> <p>Whisked away by the trickster god, Loki, in exchange for his freedom from life as a thrall, Oli is to apply his sensuous skills to appease the male gods still in mourning after Ragnarök. The time of the old gods is over, but as penance for the role he played, Loki employs Oli's help to usher in the next chapter of the gods' existence with a bang.</p> <p>Most alluring of all, however, might be Loki himself—the one god playing hard to get.</p> <p><i>Indulge in the divine desires of the Norse gods in this enticing standalone novel. It can be enjoyed independently of other installments of Lovers of the Gods, and unlike</i> Last Courtesan of Olympus, <i>is as much a romance as it is a romp through the nine realms.</i></p>";
