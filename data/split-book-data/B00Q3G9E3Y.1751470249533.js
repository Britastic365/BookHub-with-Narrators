window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It's not really about the boots â€¦ or is it? <i>Boot Points</i> is a set of short tales about Violet Parker's purple boots. It is set in the story time between the third and fourth books in the Deadwood Mystery series. Each tale not only explains more of Violet's history, but also shows the role each character plays in Violet's life. In addition to this short story, there is a deleted scene from <i>Nearly Departed in Deadwood</i>, the first book in the Deadwood Mystery Series. Also, there are three short stories called \"Dancing with Dialogue,\" \"Rainstorms,\" and \"Metro Madness\" pulled from Ann's short story vault.</p>";
