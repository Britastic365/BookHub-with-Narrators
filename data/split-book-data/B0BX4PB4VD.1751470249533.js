window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Everything about billionaire Coleman Grant III oozes power and sex. And not the perfunctory kind either, but the sheet clawing, heart stopping, gasping for air after you've screamed so loud you can't breathe kind. From his dark wavy hair that stands in an artfully rumpled mess to the blue eyes that sear your skin and his full, sensual lips—on the surface he's pure perfection. Too bad he's an asshole—an arrogant, uptight corporate raider hell bent on destroying the environment one species at a time.</p> <p>Everything about Olivia Ramsey screams hippie humanitarian. From her blond hair tied in a sloppy bun to her faded jeans with the Bonnaroo patch sewn on the thigh and her combat boots still splattered with mud from the previous day's site visit. So it makes perfect sense that they would get married. In Vegas. Stone-cold sober.</p> <p>Cole needs a wife. Olivia needs to save an endangered species. But what starts as a marriage of convenience soon turns into a battle of wills and sexual tension. Love is a game, and Olivia and Cole are ready to win.</p>";
