Dancing around your terrible hotel room to \"Come and Get Your Love\" like Star-Lord in <i>Guardians of the Galaxy </i>- naked? Yeah. Me too.</p> <p>And yet, here we are.</p> <p>This isn't even the most unprofessional thing that's happened between us in the past couple of weeks.</p> <p>The first was when I agreed to let her have Christmas Day off, but only if she goes with me to three family gatherings as my fake girlfriend.</p> <p>The second was when she caught me belting out a Christmas song on stage in the awful hotel bar.</p> <p>The third was the hot, drunk, angry sex that followed, but I do not regret it.</p> <p>And she hasn't even found out the real reason I need her by my side this holiday season.</p> <p>I need to pull it together before I do the dumbest, most unprofessional thing of all - fall head over heels in love with the only assistant who's lasted more than a month at the job and claims to hate me and my moods more than she hates eggnog.</p> <p><i>And I've seen how much she hates eggnog.</i></p> <p><b>This audiobook is dual narration, with portions that are duet-style.</b></p>";
