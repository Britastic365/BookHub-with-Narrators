No matter the cost. No matter the lives that stand in my way. She has always been mine. She just doesn’t know it yet.</p> <p>Dominic</p> <p>My brother has lost it, more so than ever before. I couldn’t figure out what had changed at first. One look at her though, and it all made sense. He gave me one job, protect his girl, a girl he’s never even spoken to. I held true to my promise and then some. I didn’t mean to kiss her, to touch her. One thing is for sure, though. I’m not losing her, even if I have to go through my brother to have her.</p>";
