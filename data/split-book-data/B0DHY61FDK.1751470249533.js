window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Leaving wasn’t an option. She had to stay to protect everything, and everyone, she’d grown to love. Especially him.</b><br> <br> Ryleigh Lodge has secrets. Her new friends, the men and women at The Refuge, already know that for months she lied about her name, her hacking skills, and how she got the job in the first place. But there’s one last secret. One so explosive, it could cost her everything…her friends, her new home…the man she’s been falling for since the day she arrived at The Refuge. Not that she hasn’t already ruined any chance with Tiny. Fact is, she should have left a long time ago. Now Ry’s brought evil to their door—and she’s the only one who can stop it. Leaving is no longer an option.<br> <br> Spencer “Tiny” Denny has trust issues. And no one can blame him; even if he hadn’t seen his fair share of hell as a former Navy SEAL, the last time he loved a woman, he barely escaped the relationship with his heart intact—figuratively <i>and</i> literally. He should’ve known the pull he felt toward Ryleigh was too good to be true. So the second he heard about her lies, he put her on lockdown, watching her like a hawk and treating her like the enemy…until he discovered her actions were borne of deep fear. Now Tiny’s keeping her close for different reasons. Partly to keep her safe…and partly because his feelings for her have only grown stronger.</p> <p>When the threat that’s been hunting Ryleigh for ten long years finally makes a move, for the first time in her life, she’s not fighting alone. Tiny’s got her back, and with his love and support, she’s ready to do battle…for their friends, their found family, and for The Refuge.</p> <p><i>Deserving Ryleigh</i> is the 7th and final book in <i>The Refuge</i> Series. Each book is a stand-alone, with no cliffhanger endings.</p>";
