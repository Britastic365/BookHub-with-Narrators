And seduce the only woman he has ever loved...without getting killed. </b></p> <p>Cybernetic spy models are different from other humans-turned-machine. For one thing, they never completely lost touch with their humanity or their memories. But retaining their identity doesn’t mean the military didn’t mess with their lives. Seth lost the woman he loved because of their web of lies. When the chance arises to make things right, he relies on his superior intellect - and irresistible charm - to prove his innocence, and make Anastasia his again. </p> <p>Anastasia might possess upgraded parts and programming, but the scientists never could cure her of her biggest weakness: jealousy. The volatile emotion made her walk away from love once. Can she overcome it and recognize the truth? Or will she continue to let the military manipulate her emotional strings? </p>";
