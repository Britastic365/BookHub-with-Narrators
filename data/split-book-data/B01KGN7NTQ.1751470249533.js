Me. </p> <p>His name is Nate and I should hate him, but I don't. </p> <p>I'm not supposed to know his real name, even worse, I'm not supposed to care. He is nothing to me but means to an end. The plan is simple: break free, collect the pieces of my broken soul, kill the bastards and run away. </p> <p>His name is Nathaniel Thomas Vela, and I've never seen his face, though I hear that it's beautiful. </p> <p>Behind the rugged and handsome exterior, there's a quiet murderer, a killer who thinks guns are for pussies and ends people with his bare hands. </p> <p>His name doesn't matter, neither does his face, but what does matter is my heart. And right now, sadly, it's his. </p> <p><i>Blood to Dust</i> is a standalone, full-length novel. It contains graphic violence and adult situations some may find offensive. </p>";
