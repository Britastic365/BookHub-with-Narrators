window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Fate be damned.</b></p> <p>Now imprisoned in Moros, buried deep in the Land of the Dead, Finnian is determined to right a wrong he made centuries ago. Somewhere in the hellish landscape is his father, and he intends to find him and flee their chains together.</p> <p>Cassian, the High God of Death and Curses, has one desire: get Finnian to confess where he’s hiding a valuable weapon—one <i>deadly</i> to deities.</p> <p>For centuries, the High Goddess of Fate has plagued Cassian over a dispute that took place between them long ago. Desperate to end her antagonizing once and for all, Cassian grants Finnian with a choice to either hand over the weapon or endure one of his curses.</p> <p><i>The Kiss of Delirium.</i></p> <p>After centuries of using necromancy, stealing the High God of Death and Curses’s souls, and playing a heated game of cat-and-mouse, Finnian knows all the ways to crawl under Cassian’s skin. Racing against the silent clock of the curse chipping away at his sanity, Finnian must figure out a way to outwit his long-standing enemy and learn the whereabouts of his father before his mind erodes entirely.</p> <p>However, the more their fates begin to tangle, the more old feelings ignite.</p> <p>Chaos is inevitable.</p> <p><i>Even in Death</i> is the second book in the Fragile Divine, an interconnected dark fantasy romance series about the frailty of gods and goddesses. You can expect high stakes, all the emotions, a mythology-inspired world, urban settings, mental health rep, and a little horror. The series must be listened to in order.</p> <p>Publisher's Note: <i>Even in Death</i> is not intended for listeners under 18 years of age.
