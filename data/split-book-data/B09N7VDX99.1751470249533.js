window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>USA Today </i></b><b>best-selling author Claudia Burgoa brings us a snarky and sassy small-town romantic comedy with a swoon-worthy billionaire, a second chance romance, and big laughs. </b></p> <p><i>Sometimes what you're looking for is right where you left it. </i></p> <p>Every summer, Mane Cantú came to Luna Harbor to visit his grandfather. When we were teenagers, we fell in love. </p> <p>We promised to be each other’s forever. </p> <p>He promised to come back for me. Spoiler alert: he broke all of the promises. </p> <p>I grew up, but that big heartbreak was it for me. I built a successful lavender farm and a shop, and that’s now my only priority. All is well until Mane’s grandfather falls ill and all the Cantú family comes back to Luna Harbor. For good.</p> <p>What’s worse is that Mane’s now famous. Like, real-life famous, not Luna Harbor famous. He made a name for himself with his band, and he and his perfect face dare to open a bar next to my store with his band mates. </p> <p>Well, he may have started the war, but I plan to finish it. </p> <p>Except now we’re seeing each other everywhere, and I’m starting to remember the way we used to be. </p> <p>Still, I’m sticking to my guns. I’m not falling for the prodigal son. </p> <p>Until one kiss changes everything.</p>";
