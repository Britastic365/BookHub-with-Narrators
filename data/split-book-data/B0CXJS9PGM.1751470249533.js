A love that will either destroy their kingdom or save them all.</b></p> <p>Raised in a world where humans are oblivious to magic, I always thought I was ordinary. Until a breathtakingly handsome stranger pulled me into a world where creatures of unimaginable power reign, hidden from mortal eyes.</p> <p>The whispers in my mind? They weren't madness. It was the voice of my inner beast. It turns out I'm not a human at all—I'm a dragon princess.</p> <p>My infuriating captor claims it's my destiny to marry a prince, to become the savior of an ancient dragon race, and end a curse that's left them barren. But Draconia, the isle of dragons, is a maze of ruthless royal courts, treacherous lands, and dark secrets.</p> <p>With each passing day, my heart is tossed in a tumultuous storm between two princes: the charming future king—my betrothed, and his mercurial brother, who ignites a fire that could raze the entire kingdom.</p> <p>And I desperately need that inner fire because it's the key to surviving the deadly Imperia Trials. In this brutal contest, the last dragon standing will reign over our divided kingdom. Beyond love and duty, it's a battle for survival.</p> <p>But how does one choose between heart and soul when both could mean certain death?</p> <p><i>This book contains a growly alpha dragon, a fierce princess, smoldering slow burn with forced proximity, and fated mates. Dive into a realm where passion, duty, and power collide. Intended for mature listeners.</i></p>";
