window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>There's a maniacal murderer on the loose, brutally slaughtering young women with a ferocity that rivals that of vampires Harry Koegh has spent his life combatting. The Necroscope's been asked to solve the crimes...asked by the dead spirits of the madman's victims.</p> <p>Harry cannot turn down a request from the dead...even if it costs him his soul. In the climactic battle with the vampires, mankind prevailed and purged the vampires from earth - thanks to Harry, his team of psychically-gifted spies, and Faethor Ferenczy, long-dead \"father\" of the world's vampires, who betrayed his own kind.</p> <p>But Harry's alliance with Faethor has a terrible cost - Harry's very humanity is under attack from the vampire evil coiled in his mind!</p>";
