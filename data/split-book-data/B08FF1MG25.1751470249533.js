window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>There’s no such thing as a right time to fall in love. It happens, or it doesn’t. Possible to fake, but not force. Impossible to simply wish away. This is the path that Rob and Iris find themselves on. </p> <p>He’s adjusting to cross-country move, a new job, and an existence that doesn’t include the woman he thought he’d spend his life with. She’s overburdened by her family, learning the beauty of loneliness, and just trying to...breathe.</p> <p>Neither of them quite ready to entertain the idea of dating, let alone love, but they can’t seem to avoid each other.</p> <p>He calls it “fate”. She calls it “crazy”.</p> <p>Maybe, neither of them is wrong. </p> <p>When pretense is stripped away, and feelings - good, bad, and ugly - are laid bare, all they’re left with is their truth. It’s up to them to figure out what to do with it.</p>";
