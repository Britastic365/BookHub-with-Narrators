And when I’m the only soldier out of hundreds that the Soul Eater leaves alive, I realise that something about me has intrigued him.</p> <p>But what is it? What could a twenty-three-year-old guy from the south, with no one and nothing in the world, have possibly done to capture the attention of a death monster with horns, blackened fingertips and a face hidden in the dark depths of his hood?</p> <p><i>Soul Eater </i>is book one of Monstrous, a post-apocalyptic fantasy series featuring monsters and human men falling in love. It is a m/m love story and contains sexually explicit content and graphic depictions of torture and violence.</p>";
