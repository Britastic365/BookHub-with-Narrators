I do carry the trace of an angel. But not for the reason he thinks.</p> <p>When the truth about me is revealed, it isn’t the demons who are after us this time. It’s the archangels. And they’ll stop at nothing to eliminate the evidence of their own darkness—me.</p> <p>With a host of vengeful angels chasing us, Dominick makes a pact with the Prince of Demons. A pact that leads us straight into the demon prince's Parisian lair--a place so decadent and demonic that we may never escape. Or want to.</p> <p>With angel armies and demon hordes gathering, who can we trust? And if Dominick makes a deal with the devil to save me, will his soul be lost forever? </p> <p><b>Dominick and Ella’s story finishes in the demonically steamy book three in the Dark Fallen Angels trilogy.
