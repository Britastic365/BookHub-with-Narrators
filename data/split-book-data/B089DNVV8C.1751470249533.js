But he still thinks that she should shoot a little higher, anything that gets her the heck out of Kilgore, Texas.</p> <p>Two, he likes riding bulls. It’s a dangerous job, and when he gets on the back of one of those thousand-pound death machines, he can finally feel his head clear enough that he can think.</p> <p>Candy and Banks would never get along.
