window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Welcome to Nocturne Falls, the town that celebrates Halloween 365 days a year. The tourists think it's all a show: the vampires, the werewolves, the witches, the occasional gargoyle flying through the sky. But the supernaturals in town know better. </p> <p>Living in Nocturne Falls means being yourself. Fangs, fur, and all. </p> <p>Vampire Sebastian Ellingham wants one thing: to marry Tessa Blythe, the Valkyrie he's fallen madly in love with. So meeting her parents seems like the natural thing to do. He's even looking forward to it, until he discovers they've already found her a husband. Now the only way to keep Tessa in his life is to complete a series of tests meant for a very different kind of supernatural. And failing means losing her forever. </p>";
