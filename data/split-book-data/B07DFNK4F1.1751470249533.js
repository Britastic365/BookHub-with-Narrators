window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>As a former assassin in the Hunter program, Asher is one of a small group of Gen One Breed vampires who survived the horrors of a madman's laboratory and the cruelty of the training that made him one of the most lethal beings in existence. Now, 20 years after his escape from those hellish origins, Asher is a loner whose heart is as cold as his skills are merciless. But when he thwarts a killing under way in the middle of the desert outside Las Vegas, Asher meets a beautiful woman who draws him into a deadly game against powerful enemies....</p> <p>Orphaned as a child after her mother's murder, Naomi Fallon didn't survive 26 years on the street without using up most of her nine lives. But when her latest caper lands her in the Mojave against a Vegas gangster's henchmen, she's certain her number is up. Then he appears - immense, brutal, and far from human. Naomi's never needed anyone's help, least of all one of the Breed. But, after one risk too many, only a man with Asher's skills can keep her safe. Yet, the solitary, seductively handsome vampire has enemies of his own and a secret that will not only shatter her faith in him but her heart, proving what she's feared all along - that trust is only an illusion, and love may be the sharpest weapon of all.</p> <p><i>Contains mature themes.</i></p>";
