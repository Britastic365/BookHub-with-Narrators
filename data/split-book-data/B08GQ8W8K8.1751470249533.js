Will avoid responsibility at all cost.</p> <p>Banished from his pack for being gay, Yev has one last chance to redeem himself in the eyes of his family. He needs to stick to the rules for a year and bury his sexuality forever.

Life would be great if he could just avoid any and all responsibilities.</p> <p>He doesn’t want to be his mom’s caregiver, doesn’t want to take over the family fox farm, doesn’t want to return to his village, and doesn’t want a steady boyfriend.</p> <p>His world turns upside down when he’s arrested by an infuriatingly attractive forest ranger. If that wasn’t bad enough, he’s now hunted by werewolves for discovering their drug-smuggling operation, and...he turned into a fox?</p> <p>Helpless and wounded, he seeks sanctuary with the very man who got him into this mess, but what’s a fox to do? If there’s someone who can help him understand his changeling origin, it’s Yev. A werewolf.</p> <p><b>Possible spoilers:</b></p> <p><b>Genre:</b> paranormal M/M romance with dark elements.
