window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A human's shattered trust, a love turned to ash, and three fae warriors who must choose. Will they fight for the woman they betrayed or fall to the darkness they awakened within her?</b></p> <p>I never saw it coming, but I should have. Their betrayal has ensured my punishment at the hands of the monster I thought was dead.</p> <p>Varrik is determined to break me, his brutal games stripping away my hope for a future as surely as my flesh is flayed from my bones, a canvas for his depraved diversions.</p> <p>Kallum, Grey, and Dane—the fae males I'd foolishly allowed into my heart—have delivered me to my worst nightmare. They watch as I suffer, their heated gazes and gentle touches a cruel mockery of the fragile bond we'd begun to forge. But as I lay in the darkness, my own grows stronger, whispering seductive promises of destruction.</p> <p>The Harbinger.</p> <p>This time, I won't ignore it. I'll embrace the only weapon I have left—Death itself—letting each vicious act fuel the fire of vengeance burning inside us until the lines between who I was and who I'm meant to be are blurred beyond recognition.</p> <p>One thing is clear: together, the Harbinger and I will watch as our enemies kneel in the ashes of their own making, choking on the same blood and tears they've wrung from my broken body... even if that means the three men I let into my heart are destroyed as well.</p> <p>Because in this twisted world of pain and power, the only way to survive is to let the flames consume us all.</p> <p>Owned by the Fae <i>is the second dark romantasy in the Dark Realms: Duet 1, The Harbinger. If you like twisted fae antiheroes and a strong yet vulnerable FMC, multiple PoVs, and dark tropes with bite, listen to the end of Lia's story now. Please note that in this insidious, dark realm, humans are considered nothing but slaves.</i></p>";
