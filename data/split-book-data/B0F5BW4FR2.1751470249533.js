window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Tarley Fareview, idealistic and stubborn, does what she can to support herself in spite of an unjust Kaloma law that says she's beholden to a man's keeping. When she defends herself after being harassed by a man, she is forced to flee into the woods disguised as a boy. She happens upon a dying man and must decide if she will risk her life to save him. Unable to walk away, Tarley chooses to intervene and saves the stranger, only little does she know that by doing so, she’s risking the heart she promised herself she’d never give to anyone.</p> <p>When the Crown Prince of Jast, Lachlan Nikolas—forced by his father to attend treaty negotiations with the kingdom of Kaloma in disguise—is attacked, his horse bolts, and they both careen over a cliff, falling into a raging river and their untimely deaths. Only, miracle of miracles, Lachlan doesn’t perish and instead is given a second chance at life, but at a price. When he wakes, he’s not only been stripped of his clothes but also his identity. Saved by a strange woman, Lachlan is forced to reinvent himself, open his heart to discover the truth about worthiness, and discover what it means to sacrifice oneself for true love.</p>";
