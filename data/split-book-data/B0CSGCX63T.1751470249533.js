window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>**This is Robert's story before he became the Robert you know in the Forty Proof Series.**</b></p> <p>In 1876, we were called to Savannah, Georgia to help with an infestation of demons. If we'd known what we, my wife Evangeline, and I, were walking into, we'd have run the other way.</p> <p>As it was, we shared tea with a vampire and stepped into a battle we did not understand until it was too late. </p> <p>On the night we arrived, Evangeline went missing, taken from our room.</p> <p>Now, in a strange city, filled with demons, and monsters, I must find her before those monsters make her one of their own.</p> <p>The only question that remains is one for you, dear listener. </p> <p>Are you brave enough to come with me on this journey, my friend? It is not for the weak of heart, but for those who believe that love is always strong enough...and that a kind soul or two can make all the difference in your life as you face the darkness.</p> <p><b>**You can listen to this novella WITHOUT having listened to any of the other books in the Forty Proof Series. Robert's story continues in Midlife Bounty Hunter**</b></p>";
