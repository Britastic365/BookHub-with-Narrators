window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The first body is torn apart, blood and flesh discovered across both state and federal lands. As the victims multiply, a pattern emerges—each is related to past cases investigated by Laurel Snow, with the assist of Huck Rivers, Washington Fish and Wildlife captain. When friends and loved ones are targeted, things become even more chillingly personal.</p> <p>As Laurel and Huck team up again to navigate the gruesome and increasingly bizarre killings, they must also keep a safe distance from Laurel's half-sister, Abigail, a dangerously clever sociopath. Ever since their father reappeared in town, Abigail has been convinced she must protect Laurel from his malignant narcissism—a scourge she's sure they've both inherited. Huck is not spared either as a shocking development in the case touches his own life.</p> <p>With the murders, and the suspects, multiplying around them, and the lives of everyone in their orbit at stake, only Laurel's sharp analytic skills, Huck's deep gut instincts, and their growing bond will enable them to face the demons within and the threats without—before they're next on an elusive killer's hit list . . .</p>";
