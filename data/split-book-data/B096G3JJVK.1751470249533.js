window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Half fae. Half dragon. All theirs. </b></p> <p><b>Or so they say. I’m not really the Queen of Dragons, am I?</b></p> <p>I’m just Lissa, a screwed-up ex-foster kid with a dangerous taste in men...and these four dragon shifters think my destiny is to save their world. Our assets: a can-do attitude, a hot rock, and me. What could go wrong?</p> <p>When Drake walks out of a lake naked to rescue me from my terrifying ex, he turns my life upside-down. And that’s before his three gorgeous best friends crash through my ceiling. Turns out they’re battling to save all of dragonkind from extinction. Oh, and dragons are real, their magic is running empty, and there’s only one way they can recharge. It involves me, them, and the best night of my life.</p> <p>I’m on board with this plan...if only the witch who's taken control of their ancestral home and my throne would stop hunting us down. When I’m thrown into the deep end, only quick thinking and my fiercely protective dragons can save me. But there’s no end to the secrets this world holds...and my past is one of them.</p> <p>Either I become who I was born to be, or we all perish. It's time to embrace the flame.</p> <p><b><i>Drake’s Flame</i></b><b> is the first book in The Fae Dragon’s Harem, a paranormal reverse harem FMMMMM series with MM scenes. Book Two, Gale Force, is already available. So scroll up and start listening now, and dive into a whole new world of magic, danger, and passion...and more hot dragon shifters than you can shake a frankly unnecessary purple rabbit at.</b></p>";
