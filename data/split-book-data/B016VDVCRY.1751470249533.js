window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Eva Webb didn't know what she'd find the night she secretly followed her fiancé. She had feared he was meeting another woman. </p> <p>But it was so much worse than that. </p> <p>The man she loved betrayed and kidnapped her, packing her onto a truck destined for the black market to be sold to the highest bidder. </p> <p>But when the vehicle is ambushed, she is delivered into the hands of her fiancé's enemies: mercenary brothers who would stop at nothing to take him down. </p> <p>For Gabriel and Syn Rivera, hijacking the truck and stealing its cargo was another job, another way of taking back what was stolen from them. Discovering Eva on board was an unexpected bonus. They now held in their grasp the one thing that could bring down an entire organization, making her a pawn in a deadly game - a game in which she'd need their protection to survive. </p> <p>But that protection would come at a price. </p> <p>Now captive to the brothers, Eva would learn that they have always shared their women, and she would be no exception. They would keep her safe. They would protect her. They would make her theirs. </p> <p>But in a world where criminals often wear two faces, where putting your trust in the wrong people can get you killed, will Eva find she has mistaken lust for love, or will this unlikely union survive? </p>";
