window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Cole and Laila have been inseparable since they could crawl. And they've </b><b><i>never</i></b><b> thought about each other </b><b><i>that way. </i></b><b>Except for when they have. Rarely. Once in a while, sure. But seriously . . . hardly ever.</b></p> <p>Cole Kimball and Laila Olivet have been best friends their entire lives. Cole is the only person (apart from blood relatives) who's seen Laila in her oversized, pink, plastic Sophia Loren glasses. Laila is always the first person to taste test any new dish Cole creates in his family's restaurant . . . even though she has the refined palate of a kindergartener. Most importantly, Cole and Laila are always talking. About everything.</p> <p>When Cole discovers a betrayal from his recently deceased grandfather that shatters his world, staying in Adelaide Springs, Colorado, is suddenly unfathomable. But Laila loves her life in their small mountain town and can't imagine ever living anywhere else. She loves serving customers who tip her with a dozen fresh eggs. She loves living within walking distance of all her favorite people. And she's very much not okay with the idea of not being able to walk to her <i>very</i> favorite person.</p> <p>Still, when Cole toys with moving across the country to New York City, she decides to support her best friend—even as she secretly hopes she can convince him to stay home. And not just for his killer chocolate chip pancakes. Because she loves him. As a friend. <i>Just</i> as a friend. Right?</p> <p>They make a deal: Laila won't beg him to stay, and Cole won't try to convince her to come with him. They have one week in New York before their lives change forever, and all they have to do is enjoy their time together and pretend none of this is happening. But it's tough to ignore the <i>very inconvenient</i> feelings blooming out of <i>nowhere</i>. In both of them. And these potentially friendship-destroying feelings, once out in the open, have absolutely no take-backs.</p> <p>If <i>When Harry Met Sally</i> had a quippy literary love child with <i>Gilmore Girls'</i> Luke and Lorelai, you'd get Cole and Laila. Just . . . don't tell <i>them</i> that.</p> <p><b>Author's Note: Cole and Laila are best friends who slow-burn (like, for nearly forty years, so…SLOW) toward love and yet never see it coming in this low-spice/clean, laugh-out-loud friends-to-lovers rom-com. All it takes is the threat of being separated, a trip to NYC, one night in one bed, a fake blind date for the ages, and a little dancing on a penthouse rooftop for the slow-burn to finally, </b><b><i>finally</i></b><b> ignite.</b></p>";
