window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Savage. Reckless. Wild. These are only some of the words used to describe me. I'm all of those things, and I never wished to be anything else in almost 500 years of existence.</p> <p>Then she came along. Aurora Leal, the daughter of the High Witch and destined for that role. She's practically royalty in the magical world, but most importantly, she's forbidden fruit.</p> <p>I was taught never to mess with witches, and I had no intention of breaking that rule until the night she crashed into my life. I couldn't resist the pull, and like an idiot, I succumbed to her charms.</p> <p>Now I'm screwed. What was supposed to be only a hookup left a permanent mark. I ended up mated to the sassy witch. An eternal commitment wasn't something I ever wished for, but when your destined mate is promised to someone else, that's a much bigger problem.</p> <p>I only have two choices. Either I find a way to break the mating bond or Aurora will become a widow before she says I do. That will definitely start a war between vampires and mages. But the more time I spend with her, the less inclined I am to give her up.</p> <p>Damn, I guess I'm killing some mages, then.</p> <p><b>Contains mature themes.</b></p>";
