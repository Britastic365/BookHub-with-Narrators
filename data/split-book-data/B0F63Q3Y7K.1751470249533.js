I want a baby with no baby-daddy in the picture, and Hunter has promised to vanish once his mother passes. If we abide by the contract, we both get what we want, no harm, no foul.</p> <p>But nothing about being with Hunter is simple. Not our explosive chemistry. Not the irreplaceable way he makes me feel. And certainly not the way my heart melts every time I wake up cradled in his arms.</p> <p><b>I’m falling hard for this damaged man, but when wounds from his past tear us apart, I’m sent running back to my small town with a secret.</b></p> <p>A shocking secret that will change both our lives forever...<br> <br> <b>THE FORBIDDEN BILLIONAIRES series is complete:</b><br> <i>Take Me I'm Yours<br> Make Me Yours<br> Pretending I'm Yours<br> Baby I'm Yours</i></p>";
