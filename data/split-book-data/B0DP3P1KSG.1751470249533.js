For years he's translated their descriptions of attackers into \"WANTED\" posters. While listening to the victims' pain is emotionally draining, Tino accepts this as part of the job--until he discovers that he and his newest client have a personal connection. He is devastated to see Dorothy's injuries and determined to help the police catch her attacker, but he must also deal with the return of her niece, his first love who left him when their lives were just beginning.<br> <br> <b>Charlotte Walsh</b> has always regretted leaving Tino. Her fear of being stuck in marriage like her parents' drove her away from Tino and his dreams of a house with a white picket fence. Her life did not play out as she'd expected and, after an assault by a stalker, she has returned to Philadelphia, only to have her aunt targeted for violence.<br> <br> Now she and Tino must work together to find the man who left her aunt for dead, but they soon realize the killer's true target is much closer than they think.</p>";
