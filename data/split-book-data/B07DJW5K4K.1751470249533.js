window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the author of </b><b><i>Everything We Keep</i></b><b> comes the final novel in the Amazon Charts and </b><b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><b> bestselling Everything Series. Brimming with suspense, mystery, and romance, </b><b><i>Everything We Give</i></b><b> brings to a powerful close the gripping series of love, lies, and the secrets families keep.</b></p> <p>Award-winning photographer Ian Collins made only one mistake in life, but it cost his mother her freedom and destroyed their family, leaving Ian to practically raise himself. For years he’s been estranged from his father, and his mother has lived off the grid. For just as long, he has searched for her.</p> <p>Now, Ian seemingly has it all - national recognition for his photographs; his loving wife, Aimee; and their adoring daughter, Caty. Only two things elude him: a feature in <i>National Geographic</i> and finding his mother. When the prized magazine offers him his dream project on the same day that Aimee’s ex-fiancé, James, returns bearing a message for Ian but putting a strain on his marriage, Ian must make a choice: chase after a coveted assignment or reconnect with a mysterious woman who might hold the key to putting his past to rest. But the stakes are high, because Ian could lose the one thing he holds most dear: his family.</p>";
