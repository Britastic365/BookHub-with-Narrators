window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Deepest passion. Darkest betrayal.</p> <p>Once, she was my world. The only one I loved. Then it was all ripped away—including my freedom.</p> <p>Vengeance kept me alive. It paved every step, shaped every plot. Until I finally caught her.</p> <p>I learned that line between love and hate is wafer-thin. Where once my dreams were filled with revenge, now that I have her, all I think about is the intoxicating passion we once shared.</p> <p>But there's no turning back the events her capture has set into motion. It unravels a carefully constructed world, one where enemies surround me. Everyone, that is, except her.</p> <p>Now, we only have each other—and the love that once united us, to fight our way to long-buried truths that will change everything.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
