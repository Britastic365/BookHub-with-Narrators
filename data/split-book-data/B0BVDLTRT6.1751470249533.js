Instead, her inhumanly beautiful captor spares her life, but carries her off on his velvet wings into the one place from which no human ever returns:</p> <p>The heart of the Fae Isles. The treacherous Crimson Court, where the Mother of faekind has ruled unchallenged over fae and humans for decades.</p> <p>The Silent Death is supposed to be the Mother’s loyal servant, her invincible warrior, her ruthless, soulless killer. But in the shadows he is playing a game of his own, and he needs Emelin’s magic to win it.</p> <p>If she agrees to work with him, she could free all of humanity. But can she trust a fae male with so much blood on his hands? Worse, when his smouldering dark eyes and dangerous secrets reveal glimpses of the heart behind his murderer’s mask…can she trust herself?</p> <p><i>Court of Blood and Bindings </i>is the first book of the Fae Isles series, an enemies-to-lovers fantasy romance featuring a strong-willed heroine and a broody, morally grey hero. It contains a generous dose of smouldering glances, angry yearning, and midnight meetings of the illicit type, as well as other mature themes.</p>";
