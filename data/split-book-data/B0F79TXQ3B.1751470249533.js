window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>The only thing worse than letting him in is the thought of letting him go.</i></b></p> <p><b>Jackson</b></p> <p>If there’s one thing I don’t need upsetting my quiet and comfortable routine in the small town of Darling, Montana, it’s newcomer Ash Alcott crash landing on my family’s ranch like some sort of blonde angel.</p> <p>I don’t need his flirting. Or his smile. I don’t need the way he makes me question whether or not I’m truly happy being alone at forty. I <i>certainly</i> don’t need to be giving him riding lessons or appreciating the meals he cooks for the ranch.</p> <p>The man is dangerous for my equilibrium. And he could up and leave at any given moment, tiring of this way of life. It’s happened before.</p> <p>No, I’m better off ignoring the way he looks at home in a new pair of boots and how my family and the ranchers all adore him. Ash may have brought some sunshine into our lives, but it’s best he learn sooner rather than later…</p> <p>Ain’t nothing sweet about being saddled with a cowboy like me.</p> <p><i>Sweet Like Whiskey is a grumpy/sunshine, small town romance between a stubborn cowboy and the optimistic out-of-towner who’s determined to win him over. There’s ranch life, close-knit family dynamics, gorgeous mountain views, moonlit shenanigans in a hayloft, and one very HEA. It’s book 1 in The Darling Brothers series but can be listened to as a standalone.</i></p>";
