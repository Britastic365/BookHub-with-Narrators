window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A cold case heats up in this gritty, suspenseful thriller from </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author Mary Burton.</b></p> <p>FBI special agent Zoe Spencer uses skeletal remains to recreate the faces of murder victims through sculpture. Though highly scientific, the process is also sensitive and intimate; she becomes attached to the individuals she identifies, desperate to find justice for each.</p> <p>As Zoe examines old remains, she sees a teenage girl looking back at her - the victim in a cold case from over a decade ago. Zoe wants nothing more than to tell this young woman’s story and to bring her killer to justice.</p> <p>Zoe’s case leads her to the victim’s hometown and to homicide detective William Vaughan, Zoe’s on-again, off-again lover. As the two become more involved in the case, they quickly realize that it isn’t as cold as they first believed: someone’s still out there hunting women. And with more women gone missing, time’s running out. Can they work together and stop this madman before he kills again?</p>";
