She's stuck in the small town of Crystal Lake with no money, education, or way to escape. And then Aiden and his friends come into town. People aren't sure if they're a gang of bikers or something else. There's this odd sense of power whenever they are around. But when Imani meets Aiden, desire instantly bridges between them.
