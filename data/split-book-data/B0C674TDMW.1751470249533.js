The views are fantastic, and the impressive amenities offered by my hosts have made it easy to come back for more. 10/10 would recommend.</p> <p>I’m starting to think there’s some truth to this whole mate-bond thing—if the murderous rage I feel whenever anyone threatens what’s mine is any indication.</p> <p>Scary Leia is ready to throw hands…or claws…or tentacles.</p> <p>Now my ride-or-die is stuck here with me, and our enemies are closer than we think. My men believe they can’t be heroes, but they’ve already proven there’s more to them than meets the eye.</p> <p>I intend to clear their names if it’s the last thing I do. Olympus is about to learn there is no monster greater than a bad bish like me.</p> <p><i>Herculeia the Hero</i> is book two in a duet. You will want to listen to <i>The 12 Hunks of Herculeia</i> first.</p> <p>Includes a bonus story from the Monstrously Mythic series.</p> <p>Intended for mature listeners.</p>";
