window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>You don't have to be a wolf to show your claws, but it helps. </b></p> <p>My five boyfriends - yes, five - are being much too patient with me. That's pissing a few people off. It seems that when living with a pack of wolves, there are certain expectations for the alpha's mate...and I suck at this. A few months ago, I had no idea shifters even existed! I just wanted a safe home, and this is it, although it's not at all what I imagined. When an ex-girlfriend decides to make my life a living hell, pack rules say that if I want to keep my place, I need to win my own fights. That's not easy when she's young, fit, beautiful, and a wolf. And I'm not. </p> <p>But with the help of a few friends, a little medical advice, and a whole lot of pent-up sexual frustration, one thing is going very, very well. Five boyfriends really are better than one. I just have to balance them with my child and these new pack responsibilities. </p> <p>Because, this was my second chance. I'd intended to learn how to be strong, but I was thinking more about having my own opinions and less about dominance challenges. I should be focusing on the bully picking on my daughter at school. The pack's children are being singled out by some kid, and that is a problem, but this woman will not leave me alone! </p> <p>If I want to be strong, I need to stop letting others push me around. It's time for the claws to come out. </p> <p>The Wolves Next Door series contains some profanity, consensual sex, and one adult woman who falls for multiple younger men.</p>";
