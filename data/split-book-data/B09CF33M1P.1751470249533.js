window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author Gena Showalter delivers </b><b><i>The Immortal</i></b><b>, the second dark and sexy book in her Rise of the Warlords series, featuring a cold, merciless assassin and a stubborn harpy warrior... one fated to die by the other's hand.</b><br> <br> Halo Phaninon, assassin of gods, is as cold and merciless as a machine. For victory, he crosses any line. When tasked to kill twelve of mythology’s fiercest monsters in twenty-four hours, Halo eagerly accepts. Except, each morning he awakens to the same day, forced to relive new horrors. Only one other person retains their memory—the beauty who threatens his iron control.<br> <br> Ophelia the Flunk Out hates her disaster of a life. She’s the family disappointment, a harpy warrior without a kill and powerless—or is she? Nearly every night she’s doomed to repeat her own murder, but each morning she arises to spar with Halo, the ruthless warlord increasingly determined to save her…and lure her to his bed.<br> <br> Halo’s insatiable desire for the stubborn Ophelia drives him wild…and he only craves more. If he remains in the time loop, they stay together. But if he escapes, they lose each other forever.</p> <p><b>Don't miss the rest of the Rise of the Warlords series:</b></p> <ul> <li><b>Book 1: </b><b><i>The Warlord</i></b></li> <li><b>Book 2: </b><b><i>The Immortal</i></b></li> <li><b>Book 3: </b><b><i>The Phantom</i></b></li> <li><b>Book 4: </b><b><i>The Wrath </i></b><b>- Coming Feb 2024!</b></li> </ul>";
