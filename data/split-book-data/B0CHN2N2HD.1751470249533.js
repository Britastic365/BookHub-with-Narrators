window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A young warrior-in-training faces high school, romance, and a host of magical foes in the </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author’s YA urban fantasy novel.</b></p> <p>I've seen so many freaky things since I started attending Mythos Academy last fall. I know I'm supposed to be a fearless warrior, but most of the time, I feel like I'm just waiting for the next Bad, Bad Thing to happen. Like someone trying to kill me—again.</p> <p>Everyone at Mythos Academy knows me as Gwen Frost, the Oracle girl who uses her psychometry magic to find lost objects—and who just may be dating Logan Quinn, the hottest guy in school. But I'm also the girl the Reapers of Chaos want dead. The Reapers are the same bad guys who murdered my mom. It turns out she hid a powerful artifact from them before she died. They think I know where it is, but this is one thing I can't use my magic to find. All I do know is that the Reapers are coming for me—and I'm in for the fight of my life.</p>";
