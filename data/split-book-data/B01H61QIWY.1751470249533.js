window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Troy Brennan:</b> </p> <p>Every Southie in Boston knows that name. The son of a dead mobster. The heartthrob with steel-blue eyes. \"The Fixer\" who can make or break you in this city. Oh, and my new husband. </p> <p><b>Sparrow Raynes:</b></p> <p>That's me. No one seemed to remember my name up until he barged into my life. But then he caged me. Kidnapped me. And killed every chance I had to run away from the place where we grew up. Put simply, Troy Brennan clipped my wings. I have dreams, big ones, but I doubt he'll ever let me chase them. I have no idea why he decided to take me as his wife. But I do know this: pissing off this man will not do me any good. At all. </p> <p><b><i>Sparrow</i> is a standalone, full-length novel. It contains graphic violence and adult situations some may find offensive.</b></p>";
