He’s highly trained, has a skill set meant for analysis and investigation, and meant to do important things. Yet, he’s chasing a 20-year-old starlet’s daughter around New York City because the spoiled brat never learned how to behave. </p> <p>Remington Blair doesn’t need a babysitter, but her parents insist. Keeping Flynn Coleman on his toes will be the most fun she’s had in a while. Besides, just hearing him call her name with that accent is enough to keep her running.</p>";
