window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>\"I know what’s been done to you, and I will see you avenged.”</i></b></p> <p><b>Gabriel.</b> Broken. Lonely. Scarred. Delusional?</p> <p><b>Abaddon.</b> Lord of Locusts. Master of the Bottomless Pit. Angel of Destruction and Vengeance…. But is he real?</p> <p>After a psychotic episode in his childhood, Gabriel is left shattered and unable to join society. Trapped in the orphanage he grew up in, he is plagued by nightmares of events that never happened, events that left him scarred, flinching at touch and achingly lonely.</p> <p>Until one day, he decides on a whim to not take his meds.</p> <p>Born from a cold womb in the ground, Abaddon awakens to the world with one goal: to destroy a cult that commits blasphemous crimes in his name. What he doesn’t expect is meeting a boy who survived one of their rituals.</p> <p>That is when God reveals Abaddon’s true purpose. He shall protect the boy from the vultures circling him and avenge his pain. He shall take Gabriel under his wing and provide all the love and affection the boy never got to experience.</p> <p>As they set out to hunt the monsters together, Gabriel entrusts his body and soul to his beautiful guardian angel, yet he can’t stop questioning whether Abaddon is real or just a creation of his touch-starved mind.</p> <p>Either way, vengeance has begun to cut through the cultists with its scythe, and there is no turning back, no matter how deep the rabbit hole goes.</p> <p><b>WARNING: This book contains adult content that might be considered offensive.
