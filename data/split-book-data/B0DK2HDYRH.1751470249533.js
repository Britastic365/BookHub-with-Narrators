window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>To the rest of the world, I'm a damsel; rejected by my own mates and bonded against my will.</p> <p>Now, I need them to see that broken omega, so easily underestimated, because it's up to me to save my pack.</p> <p>With threats closing in, time is running out, and if I can't find answers, I might lose Dusk, Ransom, and Umbra—the alphas I've fallen for. Alphas who have already had everything stolen from them. But I know my pack—I know the sacrifices they would make for my protection, and I can’t let them give up any more.</p> <p>I've always wondered what it means to be an omega. Now, I finally understand; if I want them to survive, it's up to me.</p> <p>They've protected me long enough.</p> <p>Now, it's my turn.</p> <p>This book is a MFMM why choose, with dark themes between love interests unlike other PoisonVerse books. This is the final part of a trilogy that exists in the larger PoisonVerse Universe!</p>";
