window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I'm no chosen one, and that's just the way I like it.</p> <p>Armed with little more than my perfect memory, weak chaos magic, and questionable sanity—you won't see me kicking down doors and taking names. I skip leg day and bring snacks instead. That's not exactly heroine material.</p> <p>As an outcast witch without a coven, I exist on the fringes of supernatural society. You don't know me unless I want you to, because that's how people like me stay alive. But I messed up—and subsequently caught the attention of three incredibly dangerous supernatural men.</p> <p>The ex who betrayed me. The liar whose secrets could rip apart my life. The devil I want to forget.</p> <p>They're all bad for me, but won't take no for an answer, regardless of how blunt I say it. They think they can wear me down. Convince me. Outlast me. Clearly not one of them knows me as well as they think, because what I lack in magic and bad*ssery, I make up for with stubbornness and an iron will.</p> <p>Romance almost broke me once—and I don't make a habit of repeating my mistakes. Not even glue would hold me together if these three men got ahold of my tattered heart. If I have to die on this hill to save myself, so be it.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
