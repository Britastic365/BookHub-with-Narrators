In order to survive, she temporarily teams up with Salcombe, posing as his high-society wife and pretending to help him while desperately searching for a way to foil the impending war and reunite with Lessie.</p> <p>With no allies to aid her and danger lurking around every corner, Zara's chances of success grow slimmer by the day.
