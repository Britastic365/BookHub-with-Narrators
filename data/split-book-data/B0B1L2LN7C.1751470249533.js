window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Caught in the web of intergalactic politics, three unlikely people will have to find a way to work together.</b></p> <p>The Grutex scientist Erusha once considered the fading memories of his past lives to be an unfortunate side effect of the rebirthing process, but now he wishes more than anything that he could forget. The little human is his mate, the light shining in the darkness of his soul. He fears she will never forgive him for the things he’s done, and what will happen when his newly found bondmate discovers Erusha’s horrific past?</p> <p>Telisa Moore is determined to ignore the pull she feels for the Grutex scientist. She thought she’d left him far behind in the lab when she and her fellow humans escaped, but he’s been invading her dreams. To make matters worse, he isn’t the only alien male taking up space in her mind. The battle-scarred Venium Head of Security looks at Telisa as if he can’t decide if he wants to pull her into his arms or send her out of an airlock. Either way, she’s got far more important things to worry about. Like how she’s going to convince the leaders on Earth to ally with the Venium.</p> <p>Nakkov would give anything to be able to return to the battlefield, to stand with his brothers and sisters against the enemies of Venora, but his mechanical arm and leg make him unfit to serve in the military as he once did. Serving as Head of Security pales in comparison to his lifetime as a warrior. He despises the looks of pity and the way his crewmates treat him as if he were some broken creature, but that isn’t how Telisa or Erusha treat him. Nakkov doesn’t want a mate, and he certainly isn’t thrilled to find out his bondmate is a Grutex traitor, but fate seldom cares about things like that.</p> <p>With war looming and a target on their backs, Erusha, Telisa, and Nakkov will have to find a way to come together in order to save millions of lives that hang in the balance.</p> <p>Includes bonus story <i>A Hybrid Holiday.</i></p>";
