window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Crank </i>is a standalone romance in a new small town, blue-collar series from <i>USA Today </i>best-selling author Adriana Locke. Join listeners everywhere as they fall in love with the delicious Gibson boys.</p> <p>This is one mistake Sienna Landry can't buy her way out of.</p> <p>As Walker Gibson looks at her, then at the damage to his precious truck (that she may or may not have accidentally inflicted), she knows she's in trouble. It's not the busted headlight and dented grill that's sunk her though. It's the downright sinful man in front of her that's the problem.</p> <p>The small-town mechanic is broody. Rough. Smells like engine grease and gasoline, and Sienna isn't sure why that's so sexy, but it is. It so is. She's ready to peel off her panties at the drop of his wrench.</p> <p>He wants her too. She can feel it when he brushes against her. Experience it as he presses her against the wall of the shop. It's thinly veiled in his deep, brown eyes when he looks at her like she's everything he's ever wanted. So why won't he give in?</p> <p>The damage to Walker's truck is the first of many mistakes between the two of them, ending with truths that rock Sienna's world. Nothing can fix her broken heart except the love of a man that won't, maybe even can't, love her back.</p>";
