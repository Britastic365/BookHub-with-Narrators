Now it was up to me to help her. I made a promise to her best friend, Anastasia, that I would do what I could to save her.<br> <br> And I never break a promise. Something about this redheaded beauty captured me from the moment I laid my eyes on her. The scars, visible and invisible, spoke to me on the most basic level and was the evidence of her strength. A strength I could relate to. I had seen firsthand what her fiancé was capable of.<br> <br> Failure was not an option. And with the addition of a man that was now considered a traitor threatening her too. Time seemed to be running out. I would show them both what happens to my enemies. Nobody touches those under my protection. But will my ruthlessness send her running from me?
