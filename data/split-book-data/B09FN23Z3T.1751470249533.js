window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I'm a fox in a wolves' den.</p> <p>My assignment was simple: Go undercover and report back about wolf sightings in the area.</p> <p>Instead, I found myself in much deeper with the wolves of Crescent Valley than I'd ever imagined. Lone wolves are mixed up with dangerous humans who know our secret, and it could put all shifters at risk.</p> <p>Making matters worse, my feelings start to grow for my alphahole boss who has the weight of a secret on his shoulders, a delicious psycho who is obsessed with me but melts my heart, and a mysterious fighter who has something to prove.</p> <p>Can I protect them while protecting our kind, or will everything crumble around me?</p> <p><i>Fox Undercover</i> is a fox and wolf shifter romance told in multiple POVs. The main character does not choose between the men. It contains mature scenes, male/male in later books, language, and a cliff-hanger.</p>";
