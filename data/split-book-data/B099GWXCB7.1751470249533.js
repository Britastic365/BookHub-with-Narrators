window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Trapped in a world of sin and sexy alpha angels. Forever defined by my black wings.</b></p> <p>My father, King of the Nora, sent me to Noir Reformatory to atone for crimes I didn't commit.</p> <p>So, what's a girl to do? Escape, obviously.</p> <p>Except I need allies to accomplish that feat, and no one wants anything to do with King Sefid's daughter. If anything, my claim to the throne has only made running that much harder, and worse, I'm stuck with two hot angels standing in my way.</p> <p>Auric is my supposed guardian, his white wings marking him as my superior in this deadly playground. Only, I'm his princess, and I refuse to bow to a warrior like him.</p> <p>And Novak, the notorious Prison King, is hell-bent on teaching me my place. Which he seems to think is beneath him. In his bed.</p> <p>This prison resembles a training camp for soldiers more than a reformatory for the Fallen. I suspect something nefarious is at play here, but of course no one believes me. I'm the guilty princess with black wings. Well, I'll prove them all wrong. I just hope it isn't too late.</p> <p>My Name is Princess Layla. I'm innocent. And I do not accept this fate.</p> <p>Authors' note: This is the beginning of a three-part dark paranormal m√©nage romance story featuring Layla, Auric, and Novak. This book ends on a cliff-hanger. The Noir Reformatory series is a paranormal prison series written by <i>USA Today </i>best-selling authors Lexi C. Foss and J.R. Thorn writing as Jennifer Thorn.</p>";
