window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>I've never been a good bet.</b></p> <p>I wear my emotions on my tattoo-covered sleeve, I say all the wrong things, and I revel in pissing off a certain redhead far more than I should. In other words, I'm the last person the court would choose to parent any child, let alone three of them.</p> <p>Yet being their father is all I want.</p> <p>So when the woman I love to hate offers to help make all my dreams come true, I jump at the chance. Marrying Ava is a convenient solution: she's my kids' favorite person and the court will absolutely approve of the woman who runs the biggest charity in Boston.</p> <p>But there is nothing convenient about the way I feel when she fights with me, or when we kiss. And I'm not sure which I enjoy more.</p> <p>This marriage may have a time limit but I'm beginning to think I'd like to keep my wife. She'll probably fight me on it, but as they say, all's fair in love and war.</p> <p><i>Narrated in duet style.</i></p>";
