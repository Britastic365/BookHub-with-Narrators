The combination of a velvet mask and a Mrs. Claus-meets-dominatrix costume gives Holly the courage to approach the hot-bodied man across the room who is as lickable as a candy cane.</p> <p>Detective Nick West is working undercover to find the sexy vixen who supposedly robbed his buddy at Sugar Plums. His interest in the pole dancers vanishes faster than a flying sleigh upon his introduction to Mistress Christmas - a leggy brunette with smoky eyes and a lush mouth that begs for hours beneath the mistletoe. </p> <p>One lap dance and their attraction flares hotter than a fireplace on a cold winter evening. And Nick is only too happy to oblige when Holly blurts out her secret Christmas wishâ€¦a night filled with sweet and dirty carnal pleasures that will land them both on the naughty list.</p>";
