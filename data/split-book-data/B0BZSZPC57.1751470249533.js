Not to mention, one hell of a love life I have no intention of giving up. I would die for any of them, but that’s not the plan.</p> <p>It’s time to see if I can stop this black swan.</p> <p>Tick. Tock.</p> <p><i>Black Swan</i> is book three in A Demon's Guide to the Afterlife series. This is the final book in Fury's story.<br> <br> This is an adult paranormal romance series with multiple love interests and some dark elements. If you don't like strong but flawed women and alphahole heroes that need to learn a thing or two about boundaries, this book is not for you. If you love works by Kristen Banet, Ivy Asher, Raven Kennedy, Jaymin Eve, and Kristy Cunning, then dive right in to the Afterlife. It'll be one hell of a ride.</p>";
