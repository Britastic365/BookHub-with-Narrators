window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>They all made a terrible mistake. One they will pay for. </i> </p> <p>For the past 10 years I’ve been a victim. A victim to my pack. A victim to my true mate, who rejected me in the most brutal of ways. And a victim to Shadow Beast, who used me for his own gains. </p> <p>Or did he? </p> <p>The beast of mystery never reveals his whole hand, but one thing is for sure...in my time with him, I've changed. Now I will no longer walk the path dictated by the powerful men in my life. Never again will I let my strength be taken from me. </p> <p>I must evolve or die. </p> <p>And we all know, with a choice like that, there’s really only one answer. </p> <p><i>Reclaimed </i>is book two of three in the Shadow Beast Shifters series, and ends on a cliff-hanger. If you like sexy, dark paranormal romances, with humor, steam, action, a tough heroine and an antihero, this is for you.</p> <p>It's full length (100,000) words and is recommended for 18+ due to language and sexual situations. </p>";
