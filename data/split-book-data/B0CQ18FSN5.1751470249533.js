window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>New beginnings…</p> <p>Talaya Richmond is content with her life as a social worker in London, where nobody knows her father was a notorious serial killer. The notion that nefarious tendencies could be passed via DNA still haunts her, but she’s determined to build a new life, one where pain and despair are distant memories.</p> <p>A meeting with billionaire oilman and infamous playboy Ridge Donovan should have been routine. Instead, it opens a door to dark desires she never knew she possessed.</p> <p>CEO to Donovan Oilwell UK, Ridge Donovan believes he’s back on track after his mother’s death two years ago. New house, new car, new position—all things he’d made an easy transition toward, but the one thing he’s determined to hold on to is his never-lose-his-heart mantra. That is, until Talaya Richmond interrupts his morning routine with claims of a paternity suit and an undeniable sensuality that incites his deepest cravings.</p> <p>Old secrets…</p> <p>While intent on unraveling the tale spun by a previous one-night-stand, Ridge is drawn closer to the alluring Talaya and the haunting pain in her eyes. When he learns Talaya is a murder suspect, instead of walking away—because their bond over shared trauma has become unbreakable—Ridge whisks her away to the safety of Sansonique, his family’s private island. Amidst the pristine beauty of the Caribbean, two headstrong strangers struggle to make peace with their past demons, prepare for a confrontation with a killer, and embrace a passion that just might destroy them.</p>";
