window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Guns n' Boys is a series about one couple and needs to be listened to in order.</b> </p> <p>Home sweet hell. </p> <p>A wedding should be a joyful affair, but it is far from that for Seth Villani. Thrust into an arranged marriage, back under the same roof with serpents and wolves who are his family, Seth has to watch his back if he is to survive until the despised event. Though with his love affair with Domenico Acerbi slipping out of his grasp and his father forcing blood on his hands, sometimes Seth wishes the dark waves of the sea nearby could swallow him whole. </p> <p>Coming back home to Italy is full of bitterness and regret for Domenico. He knows he will have to see Seth, the first man who’s found a way to his heart in years, walk down the aisle and marry. Seth belongs with Domenico, and having him ripped out of his arms is an offense he cannot bear. Yet despite the tension between them, and the growing resentment, Domenico still needs to watch Seth’s back, because there’s a target on it, and no matter how much Domenico doesn’t want Seth to marry, he will not have him dead. </p> <p>Possible spoilers: </p> <ul> <li>Themes: enemies to lovers, mafia, homophobia, assassin, organized crime </li> <li>Genre: dark, twisted M/M romance/crime thriller </li> <li>Length: 90,000 words </li> </ul> <p><b>Warning:</b> Adult content. If you are easily offended, this book is not for you. </p> <p>Guns n’ Boys is a gritty story of violence, offensive language, steamy scenes, abuse, and morally ambiguous protagonists. Behind the morbid façade, there is a splash of inappropriate dark humor, and a love story that will crawl under your skin. </p>";
