window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A fortuitous encounter. A meeting that should never have happened. </p> <p>Many years ago, two children from completely different worlds forged a connection, a fateful connection, an unbreakable bond that would change their lives forever... </p> <p>Salome knows only one way to live - under Prophet David’s rule. In the commune she calls home, Salome knows nothing of life beyond her strict faith, nor of life beyond the Fence - the fence that cages her, keeps her trapped in an endless cycle of misery. A life she believes she is destined to always lead, until a horrific event sets her free. </p> <p>Fleeing the absolute safety of all she has ever known, Salome is thrust into the world outside, a frightening world full of uncertainty and sin; into the protective arms of a person she believed she would never see again. </p> <p>River ‘Styx’ Nash knows one thing for certain in life - he was born and bred to wear a cut. Raised in a turbulent world of sex, Harleys, and drugs, Styx, unexpectedly has the heavy burden of the Hades Hangmen gavel thrust upon him, and all at the ripe old age of twenty-six - much to his rivals’ delight. </p> <p>Haunted by a crushing speech impediment, Styx quickly learns to deal with his haters. Powerful fists, an iron jaw, and the skillful use of his treasured German blade has earned him a fearsome reputation as a man not to be messed with in the shadowy world of outlaw MC’s. A reputation that successfully keeps most people far, far away. </p> <p>Styx has one rule in life - never let anyone get too close. It’s a plan that he has stuck to for years, that is, until a young woman is found injured on his lot...a woman who looks uncannily familiar, a woman who clearly does not belong in his world, yet a woman he feels reluctant to let go... </p>";
