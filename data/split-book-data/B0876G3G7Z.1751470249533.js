Tall and thin with long blond hair and gorgeous blue eyes, Anna Hayes was absolutely beautiful.</p> <p>She also wanted absolutely nothing to do with him.</p> <p>As a professional hockey player, that was a rare thing for Blue Anderson. He was young, rich, good looking, and in the best shape of his life. He wouldn’t say he had to beat women off with a stick, but...maybe he had to brush them off with a broom. Still, bad puns aside, the truth was Blue didn’t have any trouble finding someone - or someones - to share his bed.</p> <p>Except Anna.</p> <p>Never beautiful Anna with the razor-sharp wit and seriously dirty mouth.</p> <p>Despite his appreciation for her model good looks, Blue knew when to stay away. And his plan was to remain far far away from the woman who never failed to roast him within an inch of his life.</p> <p>He wanted someone nice, not a woman who’d barbecue his balls off.</p> <p>But then Blue did something stupid - something that felt incredible, but was also incredibly stupid.</p> <p>He kissed prickly, gorgeous Anna Hayes.</p> <p>And every one of his carefully laid plans went right out the window.</p>";
