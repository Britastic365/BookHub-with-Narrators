They have been split into three since before my birth, but they were not always this way. Once, we prospered, magic filling our lands before it was locked away with<i> </i>them: the monsters.</p> <p>Now we suffer and starve even as our king grows stronger and richer. Then my sister is called upon to make the ultimate sacrifice. Unable to lose the one person I love, I take her place willingly, protecting her the only way I can.</p> <p>My name is Cora Black, and I’m barely twenty years old when I’m sacrificed to the monsters. If only they knew that I crave the same darkness that lives within their monstrous facades. If only the king knew I am just as much a monster as them.</p>";
