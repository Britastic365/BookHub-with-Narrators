window.bookSummaryJSON = "Reece Gilmore has come a long way to see the stunning view below her. As the sole survivor of a brutal crime back East, she has been on the run, desperately fighting the nightmares and panic attacks that haunt her. She settles in Angel's Fist, Wyoming - temporarily, at least - and takes a job at a local diner. <p>Now she's hiked this mountain all by herself. It was glorious, she thinks, as she peers through her binoculars at the Snake River churning below. And then she sees the man and woman on the opposite bank. Arguing. Fighting. Suddenly, he's on top of her, his hands around her throat....</p> <p>Enjoying a moment of solitude a bit farther down the trail is a gruff loner named Brody. But by the time Reece reaches him and brings him to the scene, the pair is gone. And when authorities comb the area where she saw the attack, they find nothing - no signs of struggle. No freshly turned earth. Not even a tire track.</p> <p>No one in Angel's Fist seems to believe Reece. After all, she's a newcomer in town with a reputation for being jumpy and jittery - maybe even a little fragile. Maybe it's time to run again, to move on. But Reece knows there's a killer in Angel's Fist, even if Brody, despite his seeming impatience and desire to keep her at arm's length, is the only one willing to believe her.</p> <p>When a series of menacing events makes it clear that someone wants her out of the way, Reece must put her trust in Brody - and herself - to find out if there is a killer in Angel's Fist before it's too late.</p>";
