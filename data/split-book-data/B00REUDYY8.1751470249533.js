window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A collection of short fiction from Terry Pratchett, spanning the whole of his writing career from schooldays to Discworld and the present day. </p> <p>In the four decades since his first book appeared in print, Terry Pratchett has become one of the world's best-selling and best-loved authors. Here for the first time are his short stories and other short-form fiction collected into one volume. <i>A Blink of the Screen</i> charts the course of Pratchett's long writing career: from his schooldays through to his first writing job on the <i>Bucks Free Press</i> and the origins of his debut novel, <i>The Carpet People</i>, and on again to the dizzy mastery of the phenomenally successful Discworld series. </p> <p>Here are characters both familiar and yet to be discovered; abandoned worlds and others still expanding; and adventure, chickens, death, disco and, actually, some quite disturbing ideas about Christmas, all of it shot through with Terry's inimitable brand of humour. With an introduction by Booker Prize-winning author A.S. Byatt, this is an audiobook to treasure.</p>";
