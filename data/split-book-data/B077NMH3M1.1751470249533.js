window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Thrilling, witty, and oh-so-sexy, Lynsay Sands' Argeneau novel brings together a beautiful Immortal and the man who is her destiny....</i> </p> <p>For someone who's been around for over 140 years, immortal Elspeth Argeneau hasn't done a whole lot of <i>living</i>. Now that she's moved away from her controlling mother, she's tracking down rogue vampires and enjoying some overdue freedom. A fling would be fun. A life mate can wait. Yet to Elspeth's surprise, her landlady's hot grandson checks both boxes. </p> <p>Wyatt fell instantly in love with Elspeth four years ago. He's stunned to run into her again, especially as she has no memory of him. Then again, there are a lot of things about Elspeth that don't make sense, like the miraculous speed with which her wounds heal. And the chemistry that transforms every touch into an explosion of desire. But with mysterious \"accidents\" besieging Elspeth, the ex-Special Forces soldier appoints himself her bodyguard. But time is running out to uncover the truth about her enemies - and rediscover the man determined to love her for eternity. </p>";
