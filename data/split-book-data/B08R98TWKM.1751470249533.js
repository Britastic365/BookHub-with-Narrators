window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Ansel: My cousin, Aaron, helped to rescue a damsel in distress from her cartel family, and of all people, he left her under my protection. Regina didn’t know it, but I’d claimed every part of her the day I’d set eyes on her. When a faction showed up and made the fatal mistake of touching her, they had no idea they were unleashing a monster willing to destroy hell and set fire to the high waters to protect her. </p> <p>Regina: How could I not fall for a man who was the walking definition of sexy and was willing to risk his life to protect mine? I’d agreed to be his submissive in a lifestyle I didn’t understand and ended up uncovering a few of my own hidden desires. Our relationship defied logic, but I believed that Ansel would bring the fires of hell down on anyone that attempted to touch me. </p> <p><b>Warning</b> </p> <p><b>This book is an interracial romance that contains strong language and violence, light BDSM, and explicit sexual content.
