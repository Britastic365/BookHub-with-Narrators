window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>“The answer is no, Lyra”, my mother utters her favorite - I swear - phrase. </p> <p>No means I have to travel with them to another planet - again. </p> <p>No means leaving all my friends 50 years in the past. Thanks, Einstein. </p> <p>Seventeen-year-old Lyra Daniels can’t truly blame Einstein or her parents for their impending move across the Milky Way Galaxy. It’s all due to the invention of the Q-net, which made traveling the vast distances in space possible - with one big caveat: the time dilation. But that never stopped Lyra's ancestors from exploring the Milky Way, searching for resources and exoplanets to colonize. What they didn’t expect to find is life-sized terracotta warriors buried on 21 different exoplanets...Make that 22. </p> <p>As the Galaxy’s leading experts on the warriors, Lyra's parents are thrilled by the new discovery, sending them - and her - 50 years into the future. Her social life in ruins, she fills her lonely days by illegally worming into the Q-net. The only person close to her age is the annoyingly irresistible security officer who threatens to throw her into the brig. </p> <p>After the planet they just left goes silent - meaning no communications from them at all - security has bigger problems to deal with than Lyra, especially when vital data files go missing. But that's just the beginning, because they’re not as alone as they thought on their new planet...and suddenly time isn't the only thing working against them. </p>";
