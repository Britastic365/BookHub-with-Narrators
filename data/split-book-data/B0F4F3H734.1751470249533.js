window.bookSummaryJSON = "I knew the moment my soul burned. I knew the moment the Wraith of Fire had touched me. And now… Was it really so hard for the Heavens to produce some white light?

Not when I was caught in this nightmare world. One where I was to be terrorised by its ruler for an eternity. A tyrant King that wanted a new game to play. One I had no chance of winning. Not when it was my heart, that was on the line.";
