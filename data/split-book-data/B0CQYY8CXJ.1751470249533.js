window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In the heart of the South Pacific lies Point Nemo, the most desolate and remote place on Earth.</b></p> <p>At its core is a dead zone, devoid of life, where government agencies crash their obsolete satellites and space stations, confident they won't harm a soul. When the International Space Station suffers a catastrophic failure and plummets through the atmosphere, it's here that Mission Specialist Julie Rohr, an astrobiologist studying living space dust called xylem, finds herself marooned.</p> <p>Julie's only hope for rescue lies in the hands of her estranged father, Dr. Finn Maddern, a renowned mycologist. Plucked from the depths of the Amazon rainforest, Finn is thrust into a daring rescue mission alongside a team of specialists. Their destination: an impossible island at the center of Point Nemo—an island that shouldn't exist—composed of xylem.</p> <p>The island is a living enigma, giving birth to strange and terrifying creatures, each generation more evolved and deadly than the last. As the team delves deeper into the island's alien mysteries, they find themselves in a race against time: the island is moving. If it escapes the dead zone and reaches fertile waters, nothing in humanity's arsenal will be able to stop the invasive species from colonizing and remaking the world.</p> <p>With their team dwindling and the stakes rising, Finn and Julie must confront their past and face an unthinkable choice. To save humanity, a sacrifice must be made. A life exchanged for the world. The burden of survival and the weight of their family's legacy falls on their shoulders.</p> <p><i>Point Nemo</i> by <i>New York Times</i> and #1 Audible bestselling author Jeremy Robinson is a chilling journey into the unknown, a tale of sacrifice and survival that blurs the line between science fiction and horror. It's a testament to the lengths a parent will go to protect their child and a stark reminder of our fragile place in the universe.</p>";
