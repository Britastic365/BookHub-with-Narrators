window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After drinking from the fountain of immortality along with his brothers, Maxum is condemned by the gods to be entombed in the earth. Even though he has now been granted a reprieve by day, each night he is buried anew, his rock-hard body immobilized, his bones crushed by the pressure. When he emerges, his body heals, but his spirit remains scarred. </p> <p>There is only one way for Maxum to be completely free: He must kill the god who cursed him. The task will require tremendous power, so Maxum must gather talismans to equip him for the battle. To help him on this quest, Maxum approaches the alluring Airianne and strikes a bargain as tempting as it is audacious. A skilled thief, Airianne could be a valuable ally if only Maxum could trust her. Will this stealthy seductress also try to steal his heart, or will their boldness end up getting them both buried? </p>";
