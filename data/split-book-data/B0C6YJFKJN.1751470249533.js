window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A magical collection of stories new and old spanning across all of Anne Bishop’s most beloved fantasy worlds.</b></p> <p>Here, together for the first time, the shorter works of <i>New York Times</i> bestselling fantasy author Anne Bishop are included in one dazzling volume.</p> <p>A master of bringing fantasy worlds to life, this collection showcases Bishop’s impressive range, from rarities of her earliest writing to the Realms of the Blood, from darker fairytale retellings to the Landscapes of Ephemera, and from standalone stories of space exploration and fantastical creatures to the contemporary fantasy terrain of the World of the Others.</p> <p>Includes previously published and unpublished tales, as well as two brand-new stories, written especially for this collection: “Friends and Corpses,” a murder mystery in which the corpse has some decidedly unusual qualities, and “Home for the Howlidays,” a heartwarming return to the Blood Prophet Meg Corbyn and the shapeshifting Simon Wolfgard from The Others.</p>";
