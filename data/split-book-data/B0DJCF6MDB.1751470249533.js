Everyone is telling me to move on, but how can I? What I did was unforgivable, even if some believe otherwise. My whole world imploded the night I left a human dying on a classroom floor.</p> <p>I don't deserve anything good in my life, I know that. But I'm desperate for peace. Just a few moments where I can escape from everything I've done.</p> <p>When Toby offers me a solution that promises just that, I jump at it. I never imagined having a Dom but with Toby in that role?</p> <p>Nothing has ever felt so right.</p> <p>Problem is, this isn't a relationship, it's a contract. A temporary one.</p> <p>Which means I need to guard my heart and stop myself from falling for this enigmatic vampire.</p> <p>Like I said, I've never been good at doing the right thing.</p> <p><b>Toby</b></p> <p>I never learn.</p> <p>Every time I see a needy sub, I can't stop myself from offering my help. Every time, I forget that it's a contract and fall too hard and too fast.</p> <p>I'm the one who fixes them, never the one they choose to spend eternity with. That's the way it always goes.</p> <p>When Blaise bursts into my life, I already know how it's going to end. I can't stop myself from wanting to help him, but this man has the capacity to break me in entirely new ways. Maybe if I keep the boundaries strict between us, I can walk away at the end without another scar on my heart.</p> <p>Like I said, I never learn.</p> <p>Temperance <i>is the third book in the Damned Connections series. Featuring a needy sub and a Dom who's trying to avoid heartbreak, this spicy MM PNR romance will pull at your heartstrings.
