window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The Darkness is always portrayed as evil, but what if the Darkness simply wants to be accepted like any other element? To be good and save humans and shifters alike?</b></p> <p>Celestia Rainbow goes from the lands of the living to another realm far darker and more depressing than she'd ever imagined. Not only does she have to accept the darkness inside her, but she must now change her perspective and realize that there are two sides to every tale.</p> <p>Without her men and family to assist, it's time for Odion to help Celestia find the truth of who she isâ€”or, inevitably, who they all were in the past. A journey into the Dark World opens a door of memories and delivers all the answers she needs to be the unicorn shifter she was destined to be.</p> <p>Time is running out as dimensions across the galaxies are being overtaken by the Darkness. It's up to Aslan's Elite Unicorn Shifter to use everything she's discovered, reunite with her lovers, family, and trusty familiar, and save the world as they know it before it's engulfed in black.</p> <p><i>Will she be able to find her rainbow crown and fulfill the true prophecy she was destined to achieve? Only one way to find out.</i></p>";
