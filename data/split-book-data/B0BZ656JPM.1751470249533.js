window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Here there be monsters.</p> <p>It was an offer too good to refuse: spend one month in the most haunted house in the world. When the reclusive owner of Duskwood Manor opens the door to five teams of paranormal investigators, there's no way my team can say no.</p> <p>But there are no ghosts here. There are monsters. They live under my bed, in my closet, and watch me from the shadows, whispering filthy visions in my ear at night. Begging me to come with them to their world—the Void, where the monsters roam free . . . where they teach me what it really means to want.</p> <p>Every night I disappear from the mortal world to play in theirs, swallowed by their insatiable, terrifying shadows. Consumed by their claws and fangs. Caressed by slick tentacles and endless, delicious hunger.</p> <p>But the longer I stay in the Void, the harder it is to ignore its call.</p> <p>There is a price to pay for stepping foot in this manor . . . and the monsters have demanded me.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
