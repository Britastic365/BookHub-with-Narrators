window.bookSummaryJSON = "We're the D'Artigo sisters: savvy---and sexy---operatives for the Otherworld Intelligence Agency. But being half-human, half-Faerie short-circuits our talents at all the wrong times. My sister Delilah shapeshifts into a tabby cat whenever she's stressed. Menolly's a vampire who's still trying to get the hang of being undead. And me? I'm Camille---a wicked-good witch, trying to juggle faulty magic, gorgeous men, and the demonic war in which we're embroiled. Sometimes it's hard to know who we can trust... <p>The equinox is coming, and mayhem rules. A crown-prince unicorn offers us a legendary gift, but it vanishes. Goblins and trolls swarm the streets of Seattle. And now Smoky, the sexiest dragon alive, decides to stake his claim---on me. Overshadowing it all, the third spirit seal surfaces, and Shadow Wing is after it. But I've discovered a secret that could change everything. A dangerous force from the past is rising again, intent on restoring balance to the worlds---whether we like it or not.</p>";
