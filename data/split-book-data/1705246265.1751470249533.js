window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>My name is Scarlet Jones, and I'm a witch...of some kind. Probably. </p> <p>I grew up in a family full of strong Blood witches, in which my strange magic never belonged. I thought I was the only one of my kind out there, a true freak of nature, and I liked it that way. I lived on my own, learning to hunt these creatures nobody seemed to know anything about, a bunch of mindless thingies who were in the habit of sucking my magic dry wherever they found me. I even set up a party for them, just so I could teach them some manners. </p> <p>But my plan went to hell when four strangers crashed the party, people who apparently were like me. Just like that, I no longer felt like a special little flower. With four unconscious bodies at my feet and no idea what was going on, I thought that was the worst it was going to get. Boy, was I wrong....</p> <p>The rest of my life is only just beginning, and by the looks of it, it is not going to be a smooth ride. </p> <p><i>Contains mature themes.</i></p>";
