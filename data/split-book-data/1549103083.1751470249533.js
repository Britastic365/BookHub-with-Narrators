window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>The Marriage Contract: Booktrack Edition</i></b><b> adds an immersive musical soundtrack to your audiobook listening experience!</b></p> <p>Teague O'Malley hates pretty much everything associated with his family's name. And when his father orders him to marry Callista Sheridan to create a \"business\" alliance, Teague's ready to tell his dad exactly where he can stuff his millions. But then Teague actually meets his new fianc√©e, sees the bruises on her neck and the fight still left in her big blue eyes, and vows he will do everything in his power to protect her.</p> <p>Everyone knows the O'Malleys have a dangerous reputation. But Callie wasn't aware just what that meant until she saw Teague, the embodiment of lethal grace and coiled power. His slightest touch sizzles through her. But the closer they get, the more trouble they're in. Because Callie's keeping a dark secret - and what Teague doesn't know could get him killed.</p> <p>*Booktrack is an immersive format that pairs traditional audiobook narration to complementary music. The tempo and rhythm of the score are in perfect harmony with the action and characters throughout the audiobook. Gently playing in the background, the music never overpowers or distracts from the narration, so listeners can enjoy every minute. When you purchase this Booktrack edition, you receive the exact narration as the traditional audiobook available, with the addition of music throughout.</p>";
