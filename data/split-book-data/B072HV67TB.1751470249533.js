window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The Talon Pack continues with a dark secret that could shatter the future of the Packs, or save them all. </p> <p>Parker Jamenson is the son of three Packs, the sole mediator between every Pack in the United States and Europe, and he's dying. He knows he doesn't have much left in him and is in desperate need of a mate. But with the new and unyielding changes thanks to the Moon Goddess, he might not have as much time as he thinks. </p> <p>Brandon Brentwood is the Omega of the Talon Pack and the youngest of his family. He's not only one of the famed triplets; he's also the most secretive. There's a good reason for that, however, and when a shocking revelation meshes the past and present in a very unexpected way, he'll look to not only Parker but also a disgraced human to save them all. </p> <p>Avery Montag knows she's the daughter of a traitor and doesn't have much to give the wolves in the way of atonement. But she'll do everything she can to pay for her father's sins and find a way to end the war between the humans and the wolves. </p> <p>When the three turn to each other in a time of unrest and for vastly different reasons, temptation burns and seduction beckons. Only, the past, present, and future are never as solid as they seem, and the path the trio thought to travel may just vanish before they're ready. </p>";
