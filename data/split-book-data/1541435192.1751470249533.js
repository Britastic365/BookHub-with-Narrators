But never have the scales been so unbalanced as they are today.</p> <p>I'm a Norm, which means I grew up in fear of the Idols and their godly powers. And now, I'm going to be surrounded by them, day and night. I've been offered a place at the prestigious Gifted Academy, an opportunity very few Norms get.</p> <p>To survive, I must become invisible. But my hope to get through the academy unscathed goes down the drain when the most powerful boys in school set their eyes on me.</p> <p>They hate me simply because I'm a Norm. If they knew who I truly am, they'd tear me apart limb by limb. But I'm done cowering away from Idols. It's time for the Norms to fight back, and it all starts with me.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
