window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>They captured her. They punished her. Now they will master her. </p> <p>First the Vakarrans took my home. Then they took my sister. Now, they have taken me. </p> <p>As a prisoner of four of their fiercest warriors, I know what fate awaits me. Humans who dare to fight back the way I did are not just punished, they are taught their place in ways so shameful I shudder to think about them. </p> <p>The four huge, intimidating alien brutes who took me captive are going to claim me in every way possible, using me more thoroughly than I can imagine. I despise them, yet as they force one savage, shattering climax after another from my naked, quivering body, I cannot help but wonder if soon I will beg for them to master me completely. </p> <p><b>Publisher's Note:</b> <i>Mastered</i> is a stand-alone novel which is the second book in the Vakarran Captives series. It includes spankings, sexual scenes, intense and humiliating punishments, and strong D/s themes. If such material offends you, please don't buy this audiobook.</p>";
