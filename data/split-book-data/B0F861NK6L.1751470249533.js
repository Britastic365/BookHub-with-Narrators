window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Penelope Fayre, nineteen years old and the belle of the Season, knows she must marry money, but she’d hoped to find a man she could love for his personality as well as his purse. Now the Season is drawing to a close, and if such a man exists, he has been keeping himself well-hidden. Painfully aware of having failed her family, Penelope makes a bargain with herself: She will accept the next eligible offer she receives, but first, she’ll make the most of her freedom by stealing away to Bartholomew Fair.<br> <br> At the fair, she falls prey to a thimblerigger and is rescued by Philippe Valois, an itinerant swordsman who ekes out a living by taking on all comers. Seeing that “Miss Fair” appears to be alone, he appoints himself her escort. But Bartholomew Fair only lasts for three days, after which Penelope and the intriguing Frenchman must part ways forever. Great is her surprise when, two months later, she attends a Leicestershire hunting-party fully expecting to become betrothed to her host, only to discover Philippe posing as one of the footmen.<br> <br> Philip Markham is a man on a mission to reclaim his stolen heritage. Still, he can’t forget the beautiful and spirited “Miss Fair,” an obviously well-born young lady experiencing the delights of Bartholomew Fair incognito. When he discovers that she is a guest in the house where he’d planned to make his move, he isn’t sure whether her presence will bring his plans to fruition…or ruin.</p>";
