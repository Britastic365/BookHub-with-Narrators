window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>By his own admission, Johan’s always been one stubborn bastard. He’s wedded to his freedom, and the thought of bonding with a dragon has some pretty serious downsides. If he doesn’t sign on to become magical, though, he’ll be left behind - also not an acceptable outcome. </p> <p>Distant relatives to dragons, sea serpents are gaining strength shockingly fast. Breeding farms spring up on distant outposts, spitting out all manner of evil. Banished eons ago by the dragon god, the serpents are making a comeback. As the dragons seek allies, they uncover still more atrocities. </p> <p>Katya, dragon shifter and twin to the dragon prince, thought she wanted Johan as her mate, but he has more rough edges than she counted on. Besides, the serpent problem supersedes everything. She’s used to dragons being in charge, but when a serpent almost steals her will, it’s quite the wake-up call that her magic isn’t as potent as she always assumed. </p> <p>Is the age of dragons drawing to a close? If that’s true, what will come next?</p>";
