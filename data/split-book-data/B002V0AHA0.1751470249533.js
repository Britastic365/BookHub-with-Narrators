window.bookSummaryJSON = "Under the rule of a usurper king, the realm of Skala has suffered famine, plague, and invasion. But now the time for the rightful heir has come, a return to the tradition of warrior queens. And the Lightbearer's prophecy is to be upheld at last: so long as a daughter of the royal line defends and rules, Skala will never be subjugated. <p>Now a mystical fire has burned away the male body known as Prince Tobin, revealing Princess Tamír, a girl on the verge of womanhood - and a queen ready to claim her birthright after a life in disguise under the protection of wizards and witches. But will her people, her army - and the friends she was forced to deceive - accept her? Worse, will the crown's rival heir, friend to Tobin, turn foe to Tamír, igniting civil war in a fierce battle for Skala?</p> <p><b>BONUS AUDIO: Includes an exclusive introduction written and recorded by author Lynn Flewelling.</b></p>";
