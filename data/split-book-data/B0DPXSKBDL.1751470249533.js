window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>I’m in hostile territory to spy on an evil emperor.<br> I wasn’t supposed to end up in his bed.</b><br> <br> When four priceless dragon eggs are stolen from my island home of Eburos, my experience with both dragons and espionage make me the obvious choice to go after them. Dragons are my people’s most valuable weapon. Allowing them to fall into the hands of our enemies across the sea is unthinkable.<br> <br> With the help of a small strike team of my fellow misfits, it’s up to me to stop Emperor Kaeto from gaining his own dragon army and completing the mission his father couldn't—conquering Eburos. The problem? As I’m pulled ever deeper into Kaeto’s shadowy world of court politics, nothing is as it seems. The forces I thought I was fighting aren’t the ones posing the most danger to the continent’s fragile peace.<br> <br> <b>They say the enemy of my enemy is my friend.<br> That doesn’t mean becoming his lover is in any way a sane idea.</b></p> <p>* * *</p> <p><b><i>Mistress of War</i></b> is an enemies-to-lovers M/F epic fantasy with an allo-aro main character, a demi love interest, and steamy scenes. As the final series arc in the <b><i>Eburosi Chronicles</i></b>, the trilogy is loosely linked to the other Eburosi series by characters and settings. It can be listened to on its own.<br> <br> If your love language involves receiving your enemy’s severed head on a pike, Darra and Kaeto just might be the literary couple for you.</p>";
