Perhaps, her aim was poor...or perhaps her body knew its master and betrayed her.</p> <p>Either way, it doesn't matter now. She is at her enemy's mercy, and he is not going to be gentle.</p> <p>She will be spanked until she is sobbing and begging, but the real screaming will begin when the Lord of Fire claims his mate, ravaging her quivering body in the way only one of his kind can.</p> <p>Soon, she will know what it means to be bred by a dragon.</p> <p><b>Publisher's note:</b> <i>Firelord</i> is a stand-alone novel set in the same world as <i>Warlord</i>, <i>Overlord</i>, <i>Wolflord</i>, <i>Dragonlord</i>, <i>Sealord</i>, and <i>Skylord</i>. It includes spankings and sexual scenes. If such material offends you, please don't buy this book.</p>";
