To make matters worse, Avorlorna's mortal populace is starving and fodder in a looming faerie war. If they find out she's the reason for their suffering, she'll be dead before the Solstice Trials begin. But that's months away. She still has time to rewrite the realm's fate, remind the six demigods they have hearts, and find the belonging she's always yearned for.</p> <p>She has time... until she doesn't.</p> <p>Moments before she's thrust into the arena, she receives a chilling warning: \"One will betray you. One will try to kill you.\" With alliances shifting like quicksand, Willow faces an agonizing choice: fight for the love of villains or sacrifice everything for a realm that hates her.</p> <p>Trials of Dusk and Dreams<i> is a slow-burn, spicy, why-choose, dystopian-fantasy romance novel where the underdog heroine finds her inner power, the tension is hot, and the world-building is full of intrigue.
