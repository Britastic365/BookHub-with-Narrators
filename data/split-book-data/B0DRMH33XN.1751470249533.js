window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In a world of danger and destiny, Gabriel must rescue orphaned shifters while grappling with an irresistible bond with Olivia, the waitress who unwittingly becomes his fated mate.</b></p> <p><b>Gabriel</b></p> <p>I'm the last of my pack to find a mate, and it's agonizing. I crave the family life I've watched my brothers enjoy for years. So, I've chosen to assist Kade in rescuing baby shifters who are victims of an underground trafficking ring run by radical humans. It's a heartbreaking mission, saving orphaned shifter children, but it's necessary. I'm tired of seeing innocent supernaturals suffer at the hands of these extremists.</p> <p>I suspected I might meet my fated mate on this journey, but I was still caught off guard by her sweet strawberry scent, one I'll never forget. Her name is Olivia, a young waitress from Downtown Detroit. She's unwittingly entangled with some radicals while trying to help two escaped shifter babies. She thinks she's doing a good deed by bringing the children to me, but how do I tell her she's destined to be mine forever?</p> <p><b>Olivia</b></p> <p>After finishing my night shift at the diner, I never expected to find two little orphaned shifter children who had escaped an underground trafficking ring while taking out the trash in the back alley. I quickly brought them to my apartment for safety, but then took them to the only place I knew could help—Thirst Trap, a nightclub run by supernaturals. That's when I met Gabriel, a stunning wolf shifter with the most captivating blue eyes I've ever seen.</p> <p>What I thought would be a simple good deed—returning the children to their people—turned my world upside down. Gabriel claims I'm his fated mate, the woman chosen for him by the goddess Fate. He's determined to keep me. I find myself traveling to Wintermoon, where I'm supposedly meant to spend the rest of my days with this enigmatic shifter. But I'm not ready to give in. He took me against my will, and the harder I try to resist him, the stronger this inexplicable connection grows. How can I escape this mysterious creature when he has already captured my body—and soon, my heart?</p> <p><i>For mature listeners.</i></p>";
