window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In the newest Argeneau novel from </b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>best-selling author Lynsay Sands, an immortal barely escapes a raging fire only to kindle a sizzling passion with his potential life mate. </b></p> <p>Mac Argeneau knows all too well: Immortals <i>can</i> be killed. Not with holy water or silver crosses, but by decapitation or being set on fire. So when Mac’s house bursts into flames - with him inside - he’s sure it was no accident. But who would want to kill a scientist specializing in hematology? There <i>is</i> a silver lining: A blonde investigator appears on the scene and sparks feelings in him that have been dormant for centuries. </p> <p>CJ Cummings is in town on a special investigation, but she’s been waylaid by the local police to deal with this arson case. The biggest mystery is how this sexy scientist with silvery blue eyes has emerged from a blazing inferno without a burn mark on him. He’s clearly hiding something. Sure, she’d love to see him without his lab coat, but she’s got a job to do - despite his insistence that he needs a bodyguard and...he wants <i>her</i>.</p> <p>But when a second attempt on their lives puts CJ in harm’s way, it’s Mac who will do anything to safeguard the woman who’s destined to be his life mate.</p>";
