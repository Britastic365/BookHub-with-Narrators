window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Reeling from her loss, Kacey Dawson is grieving and heartbroken, her addictive demons hauling her back into the alcohol-soaked abyss she worked so hard to crawl out of. Kacey teeters on the edge of oblivion and must fight her way through the pain, to build a new life for herself with her music, and somehow fulfill the promise she made to Jonah...one she feels is impossible to keep. </p> <p>Theo Fletcher has a secret burning in his heart, one that he holds close, while he struggles to keep strong for his family, which is falling apart. His mother's health is fragile and his father's disapproval is breaking him down. Theo is afraid if he follows his heart, he'll fail, and not just himself but also his brother, who believed in him when no one else did. </p> <p>Drawn together by their pain, Theo and Kacey slowly build a friendship, re-forge old ties, help each other to heal, and give one another the courage to reach for their dreams. Together, from the depths of grief and guilt, they learn to laugh again, to trust again, and quite possibly find something beautiful and lasting amid the shattered pieces of their broken hearts. </p>";
