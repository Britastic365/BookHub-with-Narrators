window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Opposites certainly attract for the stranded pop star and small-town baker in this charming slice of romance from the author of the TikTok sensation </b><b><i>The Cheat Sheet</i></b><b>.</b><br> <br> <b>“This modern take on the Hepburn classic </b><b><i>Roman Holiday</i></b><b> is a quick, fun, slow-burn rom-com.”—Abby Jimenez, bestselling author of </b><b><i>The Friend Zone</i></b><br> <br> <b>ONE OF NPR’S BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR</b><br> <br> Amelia Rose, known as Rae Rose to her adoring fans, is burned-out from years of maintaining her “princess of pop” image. Inspired by her favorite Audrey Hepburn film, <i>Roman Holiday, </i>she drives off in the middle of the night for a break in Rome . . . Rome, Kentucky, that is. <br> <br> When Noah Walker finds Amelia on his front lawn in her broken-down car, he makes it clear he doesn’t have the time or patience for celebrity problems. He’s too busy running the pie shop his grandmother left him and reminding his nosy but lovable neighbors to mind their own damn business. Despite his better judgment, he lets her stay in his guest room—but only until her car is fixed—then she’s on her own. <br> <br> Then Noah starts to see a different side of Rae Rose—she’s Amelia: kindhearted and goofy, yet lonely from years in the public eye. He can’t help but get close to her. Soon she’ll have to return to her glamorous life on tour, but until then, Noah will show Amelia all the charming small-town experiences she’s been missing, and she’ll help him open his heart to more. <br> <br> Amelia can’t resist falling for the cozy town and her grumpy tour guide, but even Audrey had to leave Rome eventually.<br> <br> <b>Look for all of Sarah Adams’s When in Rome books:</b><br> <b>WHEN IN ROME • PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT • BEG, BORROW, OR STEAL (Coming Soon!)</b></p>";
