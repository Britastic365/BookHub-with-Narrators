Too bad he can’t stay away from her.</p> <p><b>Molly</b></p> <p>Blogging about bad dates used to be fun, but a girl can only take so much foolishness. So I broke up with my job.</p> <p>Okay, full disclosure, I was fired. It’s a long, sordid tale, involving my sourdough starter - RIP, Fred! - and my ex-boss’ serious lack of humor.</p> <p>Newly funemployed and in need of a break, I go to Asheville to dogsit for my sister…and stumble onto a scoop big enough to put my fake-dating days behind me forever.</p> <p>Augusta Glower, local success story, wrote a bestseller about the self-help group she started. People think her system works, and copycat Bad Luck Clubs have sprung up nationwide. Something feels off, though, and a little poking around by yours truly suggests she stole the idea.</p> <p>There’s one problem. I have to prove it, and the guy she ripped off - super-hot house flipper Caleb Reynolds - seems to…well, hate me. Which is too bad since his secrets aren’t the only thing I’d like to peel away.</p> <p><b>Cal</b></p> <p>Molly O’Shea is my worst nightmare.</p> <p>Is she sexy as sin? Well…yeah. Does she smell like honeysuckle and trouble? No doubt. Is she determined to dig up my secrets with a backhoe? I’m pretty sure she got a two-week rental. But I’ll never talk. If the reason I started the club gets out, my whole life will implode.</p> <p>So why is she so damn irresistible?</p>";
