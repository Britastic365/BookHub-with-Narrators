window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Books 1-4 of the Gilded Blood series.</b></p> <p><b><i>Inked,</i></b><b> book one:</b></p> <p>When Zayn, my smoking hot boss, told me to never touch the cache of deluxe tattoo ink locked away in his office, I listened… until I ran out of my own ink. I expected Zayn to yell at me when he returned to the shop. I didn't expect the fresh cobra tattoo on my client's butt to magically spring to life. Or an interdimensional filing cabinet hiding in the back of Zayn's office. Did I mention that my gorgeous, magic-ink-hoarding boss is actually an incubus?</p> <p>Now, we have to venture into a strange and distant land where a never-ending list of lethal flora, fauna, and fae await us. Add in my mother's string of poorly timed, hysterical phone calls and there is one thing I'm grateful for: there's no cell service in the fae realm.</p> <p><b><i>Jinxed,</i></b><b> book two:</b></p> <p>Things could be worse. My mom's been harboring some hefty family secrets. Big deal. Maybe there are still some teeny details about Zayn that I don't know. Let's not forget the bloodthirsty magical mob boss due to appear at any moment. No biggie.</p> <p>So long as there are no more family bombshells, incubus-related heartbreaks, or unexpected, terrifying journeys into the Fae Realm, I'll be completely fine. Because, as I've already reminded myself at least twelve times since breakfast, there's no way things could get worse. Right?</p> <p><b><i>Linked,</i></b><b> book three:</b></p> <p>A lot can change in a week. Seven days ago, I was just Talia—an art school dropout with an affinity for tattoos, a hopeless crush on my boss, and a knack for finding trouble. Now, I'm a Runemaster in training.</p> <p>Instead of sweeping floors, I'm sweeping swarms of venomous squatters out of castles. I've been enrolled in accelerated, hands-on rune lessons. Oh, and I'd be remiss if I didn't mention my incu-boss's upgraded benefits \"package.\"</p> <p>Sadly, promotions aren't just about perks. There are increased responsibilities as well: amassing a magical army alongside the newfound fae king, repairing centuries-old divisions among the Seelies and Unseelies, and vanquishing a completely unhinged demon lord.</p> <p>But hey, when you're the most coveted tattoo artist in two realms, it's all in a day's work.</p> <p><b><i>Synced,</i></b><b> book four:</b></p> <p>War is coming—and this time, I swear it's not my fault.</p> <p>Sol and his reanimated Unseelie army are hell-bent on destroying the Seelies once and for all. Worse, he's stolen the most priceless relic in this land—Zayn's grimoire—along with my magic-unleashing gilded blood. Oh yeah, and Sol's claim is slowly killing me.</p> <p>Not all hope is lost. I somehow led the elves through the mountain, arriving at the Summer Palace in one battered, weary piece. Bonus points: I've expanded our army by two hundred soldiers—never mind the fact they're completely untrained, three-foot-tall tommyknockers.</p> <p>While Zayn was busy prepping the castle for battle, my loud-mouthed Jewish mother gained the support of our equally shrill family members. Unfortunately, banshees have the power to predict the future, and our outlook isn't looking so good.</p> <p>The only way we'll survive the impending war is by finding some mysterious ally in the most inhospitable, remote corner of the Fae Realm: a ghost from Zayn's past who will either help lead the Seelies to salvation… or doom us all.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
