Mike nodded. \"Yeah, well see, that's the problem,\" he said with a sigh. \"You brought someone home with you tonight.\" \"What?\" \"And it looks like she's not real happy about your relationship with Bradley,\" he said. \"I have a jealous ghost in my house?\" Mary asked, astonished. Mike shook his head apologetically. \"No, sweetheart,\" he said. \"You have a jealous poltergeist in your home.\" </p> <p>As if on cue, the drawers in Mary's dresser opened, and her clothing started flying across the room. Mary turned back to Mike. \"Really?\" she asked. \"Like I need this now?\" She walked into the center of her bedroom and immediately was hit in the face by a pair of her own underwear. And this time she was sure of it. She heard a giggle, and then suddenly the entire room was filling with swirling clothing. Bradley came running into the room and the ruckus ended. \"What happened?\" he asked. \"I think I just met one of your former girlfriends,\" Mary said, pulling a pair of underwear from out of her neckline. \"And I don't think she was very happy to meet me.\" </p>";
