window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Nothing is spookier than a second chance at love.</b></p> <p>I'm done juggling dead-end jobs and deadbeat boyfriends. It's time to nail down my goal of owning a hotel—and fix my friendship with my ex-best friend, Jack Colson. He's a big-shot investor, and I'm going to need one. Nailing <i>him</i> barely crosses my mind.</p> <p>I might actually get my life in order, especially if I snag the deep (and deeply weird) discount for staying an entire weekend at my dream property. It's hard not to fall in love with the place. Though I could do without the creepy doll that lives there, the noises Jack insists are raccoons, and the eerie AF abandoned hotel I'd need an even spookier amount of money to renovate.</p> <p>The worst part is, I'm falling for Jack… again. He'll never invest if he finds out I have feelings for him. But as we work through the phantoms of problems past, we'll have to figure out if the property is infested with rodents—or something else that goes bump in the night.</p> <p>Happily Haunted Afters <i>is a spooky, spicy standalone small-town romantic comedy with a happily ever after guaranteed.</i></p>";
