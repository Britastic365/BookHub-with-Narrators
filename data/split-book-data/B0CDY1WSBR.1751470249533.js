window.bookSummaryJSON = "When I get separated from the other members of my Antarctic expedition, I meet a strange, pale, beautiful man who saves me from freezing to death. He says he's the actual Jack Frost, and he's pretty much an ice god, which totally messes with my scientific worldview. I'm all too happy to leave his fine frosty ass at the South Pole and head back to the States where things are messy but not magical. Too bad the charming ice god follows me home. Guess he likes me, or he's magically attracted to me or something? Jack is the last thing I need now, right when I'm starting a new job; but I can't help being curious about his powers and his ongoing war with the fire goddess Auxesia. Too bad my association with Jack puts us both in more danger. Contains mature themes. Trigger and content warnings are available on the author's website.";
