window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I was living my best life in the afterlife…</p> <p>Until a klutzy phoenix flipped the laws of life and death on their head. As the Queen of the Phoenix Afterlife, I was responsible for finding a way to fix the chaos the delightfully rebellious firebird had created between the world of the living and the… well, dead.</p> <p>Working together, we found a way to send her back through the veil between our realms. Unfortunately, things went haywire as Ryls and her mate went through, and I ended up landing in the Earth realm too. Now I’m in a world I was never meant to exist in, and I’m afraid something else slipped through with us… I have to track it down before it unleashes the phoenix version of pandora’s box on the earth. And I have to do it before the veil between the two worlds becomes completely unstable and collapses. I’ll need to generate a lot more power to accomplish either task.</p> <p>According to Amaryllis, what I needed to do first was find a mate… or mates. I’d never expected to have mates, or love, so where on earth was I supposed to start looking? Urn My Love is book one in the Just Walk It Off duology. It follows Iolani’s journey to find her three mates. There will be lots of steam and humor. The series will have a HEA.</p>";
