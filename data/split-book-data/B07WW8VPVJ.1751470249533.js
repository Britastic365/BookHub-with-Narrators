window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The Red Plains are hot. But my fae king? Even hotter. So, we kind of got captured by a warlike clan of Vundi warriors. Sounds bad, right? But they treat us as guests, and I’m coming to like them despite the ongoing threat of me being shipped off to the king beyond the mountain. I still endeavor to reach the winter kingdom and find a way back home…until the Vundi high priestess reveals that I may have more ties to the fae world than I ever imagined. On top of that, Leander knows just what buttons to press to get me naked, in a tub, and panting for him. My resolve is failing on all fronts, but worse than that, I discover danger is even closer than I realized. </p> <p>Author's Note: <i>Bite of Winter </i>is book 3 in the Fae’s Captive Series. You’ll want to listen to <i>Fae’s Captive</i> and <i>Road to Winter: Fae’s Captive 2</i> before beginning this book. Fae’s Captive 4, <i>Beyond the Mountain</i>, will complete Leander and Taylor’s story arc, and Book 5 will begin Gareth and Beth’s story (with plenty of cameos from Leander and Taylor). </p>";
