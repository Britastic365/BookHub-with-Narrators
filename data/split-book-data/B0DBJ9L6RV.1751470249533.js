window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>All Cassidy Bowman wants is one night of recklessness… and to get back at her ex.</b></p> <p>Cassidy has strict rules: she doesn't date locals, she doesn't sleep with men she isn't dating, and she doesn't do anything that might jeopardize her good-girl reputation. But after a run-in with her ex-boyfriend—and a few too many drinks—she's ready to buck those rules and get revenge.</p> <p>Local cowboy Chase \"Red\" Thompson has never met a rule he didn't love breaking. With a tarnished reputation, brash attitude, and decades-long crush on Cassidy, he's more than willing to go along with her plan: one night together that they'll never talk about again.</p> <p>Until two pink lines threaten Cassidy's rule book, and both of their reputations. She doesn't want a relationship with the rough-and-tumble cowboy. And he knows he's not good enough for Wells Canyon's sweetheart, anyway.</p> <p>Being nothing more than friends and co-parents should be easy, but lines blur and rules… well, sometimes they're worth breaking.</p>";
