I wanted to write a true antihero who would need to undergo a very serious change in his character to complete his redemption arc. Dean will make you feel all the things, sometimes against your will. You’ll love him and hate him and love him again, and never get him out of your head.—Sophie</p> <p><i>The Bully</i> is a stand-alone novel. It's the third installment in the epic dark mafia Kingmakers series—a bully romance, full of dark, twisted enemies-to-lovers conflict. Listener beware, this one is intense.</p>";
