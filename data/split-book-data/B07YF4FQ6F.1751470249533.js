Right up until it doesn't, and the tabloids threaten not just my privacy, but that of my family. I'd do anything to protect them from the limelight.</p> <p>But must it involve Hailey, the fiery PR consultant I can't stop fantasizing about?</p> <p>Hailey Connor keeps warning me she won't take on an uncooperative client. So why is she so compelled to help me? Maybe it's something about how her face softens when I talk about my family. Maybe it's because she genuinely wants to help.</p> <p>Or maybe it's my brooding demeanor that causes her to melt so fast when I kiss her.</p> <p>Even though I'm constantly infuriated by this little spitfire bossing me around, every time she smiles, I can't help wanting to pull her close and not let go.</p> <p>I think Hailey is starting to fall for me, despite being my polar opposite. But when our worlds collide, can I convince her we're a perfect match?</p> <p>For anything less than happily-ever-after.</p>";
