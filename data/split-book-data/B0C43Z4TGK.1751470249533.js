window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A heartbroken faerie queen in search of an evening of escape awakens the heart of a grumpy wolf warrior who will bring kingdoms to their knees to claim her.</b></p> <p>When I was young, I was told that my true love would be a faerie king. I didn’t heed the warning.</p> <p>I tumbled into love as soon as our eyes first met, unaware that he wasn’t what he seemed.</p> <p>My king wanted marriage, power, devotion, and a family. He had all but one, and as our kingdom stood upon the precipice of ruin, the weight of failure tore us apart.</p> <p>Though it was not the war but his betrayal that sent me running to a foreign land.</p> <p>And straight into the arms of a one-eyed warrior.</p> <p>The wolf was a weapon of heartless destruction, a rogue without a real name, and nothing I was allowed to want.</p> <p>A week spent within his city and the walls of his threadbare home was all it took to irrevocably change everything.</p> <p>And nothing at all.</p> <p>For there was no escaping the life I’d once thought I’d cherish forever. My kingdom was dying and my king would soon start searching for his missing queen.</p> <p>Attempting to keep all I’d found in the heartache he’d caused would only create more.</p> <p>So I fled from the wolf who hadn’t learned my true identity, and I returned to my kingdom with a silent vow to heal my torn heart. I would try to forgive my faithless husband and accept my bloodstained future.</p> <p>But those meddlesome fates had other plans.</p> <p>The warrior I’d left without warning was born a hunter and conditioned to be a monster. An alpha in his own right, he would accept nothing less than what he hungered for.</p> <p>Even if the battle of his life delivered our hearts to their doom and our kingdoms to their knees.</p>";
