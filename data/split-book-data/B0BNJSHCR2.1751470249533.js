window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Braeden: For five agonizing years now, I've tried to push the lush, far-too-sweet woman out of my life, and my dreams. She's a human, which makes her a danger to all the shifters in Night Falls. She's also untouched, which makes her a danger to what little restraint I possess around her with each passing day. But seeing as how she's my little sister's best friend, avoiding her hasn't been easy. And now that there's a shooter targeting the pack, the only way I can keep Paisley safe is to keep her close. As if that weren't impossible enough, the pack alpha goes and makes a decree. For her protection, Paisley needs to be mated to someone in the pack by the end of the month. Damn it all to hell.</p> <p>Paisley: I'm pretty sure the man hates me. To Braeden, I've always been the human he wished his sister would stop being friends with—literally a different species from him, being that he and his sister are wolf-shifters and all. After years watching him blatantly keep his distance, no one is more shocked than I am over his reaction when the shooter that's after the pack takes aim at me.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
