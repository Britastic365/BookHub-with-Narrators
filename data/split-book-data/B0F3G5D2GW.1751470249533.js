window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>She was a storm of violent sunbeams and catastrophic rainbows.</b></p> <p>Marrying for love was never in the stars for Creslyn. Drake is calculating, cruel, and wields a blade of death. But something about him draws her in, his shadows call to the darkness she keeps locked away inside of her. She isn't foolish enough to expect love from a marriage contract, but when they bind their vows in blood, Creslyn does the unthinkable—she claims Drake as her mate.</p> <p><b>He was a monster of shadow and night, of death and destruction.</b></p> <p>Cursed since his first breath, Drake has only known power and a realm of shadows. But now he's bound to a faerie whose heart bleeds for him, and his obsession with her only grows with each passing day. Not only is he still the Shadowblade Assassin, but unrest is brewing in Aeramere, and an attack on House Celestine confirms an ill-fated prophecy. War is coming.</p> <p>As Creslyn longs to find a way to break Drake's curse and struggles to embrace her own darkness, Drake will be faced with a terrible choice—one that will only end in sacrifice.</p> <p>Secrets will be unearthed and their bond will be put to the test, because love might be enough for a hero, but it will never save a villain.</p>";
