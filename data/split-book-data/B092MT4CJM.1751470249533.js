window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Xander was an enemy I never saw coming.</b> </p> <p>A devastating betrayal shattered our relationship before it ever began, my attempt to escape going horribly wrong. But telling Xander it’s over proves to be a dangerous mistake, revealing a ruthless side of him I was only beginning to suspect. Surrounding me with bodyguards, he swears he’ll go to any lengths to protect me. I swear he’s keeping me prisoner. </p> <p><b>Sin was a lie I believed from the beginning.</b> </p> <p>Instinct warned me we’d crash and burn. A warning I should have heeded. No less his prisoner than Xander’s, Sin is just as ruthless, his determined seduction unrelenting. My suspicions behind his motivations only intensify when he refuses to leave my bed, softening his threats of restraint with a wickedly suggestive laugh I no longer believe.</p> <p><b>I was deceiving them both.</b></p> <p>Two men who will stop at nothing to ensure I’m theirs. Two men I no longer trust. Yet, I’m powerless against my own desires, caving under their dual assault, unable to resist a decadent temptation I’d only gotten a taste of. </p> <p>I tell myself neither man will keep me from my investigation, but as shocking secrets are exposed, I question where my loyalties lie and just how much I’m willing to sacrifice for justice. Ultimately, I know there is only one inescapable truth: Revealing the killer will destroy us all.</p> <p><b>Author's note:</b> This book is intended for mature audiences due to explicit language and sexual content. <i>Sensuous </i>is a ménage romance that's all about the girl.
