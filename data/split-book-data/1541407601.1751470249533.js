window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>WINTER </p> <p>Sending him to prison was the worst thing I could've done. It didn't matter that he did the crime or that I wished he was dead. Perhaps I thought I'd have time to disappear before he got out or he'd cool off in jail and be anything but the horror he was. But I was wrong. Three years came and went too fast, and now he's anything but calm. Prison only gave him time to plan. And while I anticipated his vengeance, I didn't expect this. He doesn't want to make me hurt. He wants to make everything hurt. </p> <p>DAMON </p> <p>First thing's first. Get rid of her daddy. He told them I forced her. He told them his little girl was a victim, but I was a kid, too, and she wanted it just as much as I did. </p> <p>Step two.... Give her, her sister, and her mother nowhere to run and no fuel to escape. The Ashby women are alone now and desperate for a knight in shining armor. But that's not what's coming. No, it's time I listened to my father and took control of my future. It's time I showed them all - my family, her family, my friends - that I will never change and that I have no other ambition than to be the nightmare of their lives.</p>";
