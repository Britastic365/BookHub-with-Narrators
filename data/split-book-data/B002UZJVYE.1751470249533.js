window.bookSummaryJSON = "<i>New York Times</i> best-selling author J. R. Ward has blown away fans with her layered, tantalizing tales of sexy vampires and supernatural intrigue. In <i>Lover Unbound</i>, an immortal killer falls into the care - and possibly the arms - of a mortal surgeon. Suffering a horrific childhood as the son of a Bloodletter in his father's war camp, Vishous pledges death to members of the vampire-hunting Lessening Society. Vishous knows no love. He feels no emotion. He lives only to oppose the slayers. But after suffering a mortal wound, a human surgeon named Dr. Jane Whitcomb tends to him. Her ministrations, however, extend beyond his physical injury - and before long her tender hand has awakened feelings of pleasure that Vishous never dreamed existed.";
