I never wanted Persephone to live in the Underworld.</p> <p>But I owed Peter Pan a favor, and even I don't want to screw over an influential Fae like him. So when he asked me to take Persephone to the Realm of the Dead with me, for her protection, I had to say yes. Persephone was in the Neverland realm for decades, living as a child among the Lost Kids, hiding from people who crave her abilities.</p> <p>Now she's here in the Underworld, with a new adult body to match her true inner age, and I'm starting to regret my decision to let her live in my palaceâ€”because not only is she temptingly gorgeous, she's also far more powerful than I realized.</p> <p>Maybe even more powerful than I am.</p> <p>I've never met anyone like her. And I'm not sure I can resist her.</p> <p>Contains mature themes. Trigger and content warnings are available on the author's website.</p>";
