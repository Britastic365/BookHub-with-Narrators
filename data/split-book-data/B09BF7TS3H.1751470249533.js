The sudden loss of magic turned the tides for the first time in over two decades.</p> <p>The humans are rallying. Rioting. It feels like the stirrings of war. </p> <p>As if that wasn’t enough, Bree isn’t the sister I remember - and her desire to return to Hell is creating more fires than I know how to put out.</p> <p>Things are changing. Lines are drawn. Everyone must choose a side. Even me. </p> <p>Sometimes, the world needs a hero. In a city that’s already gone to hell in a hand basket, it might just need a demon. </p> <p>If you can’t get enough of books by Ella Summers, Annette Marie, Shannon Mayer, Deborah Wilde, K.F. Breene, Jeaniene Frost, Kelly St. Clare, and Linsey Hall, then dive right in to the dangerous depths of New Chicago. Beware of headstrong heroines with snark. These ladies don’t bark. They bite.</p>";
