When the dead call, she listens. . .</b><br><br>On a night out in a London bar, our accidental medium Tanz meets Einar, a charismatic and sexy Viking travelling for business. He offers Tanz an irresistible proposition: return to Iceland with him for an all-expenses-paid writing retreat and some no-strings-attached fun.<br><br>Promised a mix of work, play and maybe a bit of romance, Tanz follows her heart (and the voices in her head) off to Iceland on a whim; but when she arrives, she quickly realises that Einar and his charm might not be all they're cracked up to be.<br><br>Heartbroken, abandoned and left to the mercy of the long, haunting nights, Tanz finds herself surrounded not just by the rugged beauty of a land steeped in legend but also the mysteries that lurk in its shadows.
