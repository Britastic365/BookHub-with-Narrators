Two months of sun and fun at the beach? Sign me up! Until the moment I come face to face with this season's bachelor, racing's bad boy Dash - a.k.a., the mysterious hottie I just hooked up with at a creepy motel off the I-80. </p> <p>Can you say, awkward? </p> <p>Dash is sexy, charming-and totally off-limits. But the chemistry between us is way too hot to ignore. He's playing to win, and he's got his sights set on the prize: me! </p> <p>Soon, the action is heating up off-screen. But between ratings-hungry producers, back-stage drama, and 12 of the most cutthroat glamazon contestants known to womankind, I'm in way over my head. Can I find my happily-ever-after, or will it be lights, camera, heartbreak? </p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
