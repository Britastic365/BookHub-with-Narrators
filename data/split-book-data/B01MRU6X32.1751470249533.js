window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Is beauty only skin deep? </p> <p>Chemist Dr. Robert \"Belle\" Belleterre loves flowers, green trees, his best friend Judy, and \"his baby\": the new face cream he developed to help put his father's small cosmetics company on the map. Sadly he gets no help from his alcoholic, gambling-addicted father, who loses Belle in a poker game to Magnus Strong, the CEO of Beauty, Inc., the largest American cosmetics company - a man infamous for his scarred ugliness. </p> <p>Belle finds himself uprooted from his home, living in a wildly crazy apartment in New York owned by Mr. Pennymaker, and completely unprepared for his mad attraction to the charismatic Strong. Feeling like a traitor, Belle fights his passion, only to see more and more of the goodness and humility hidden by Strong's ugly face. But when Belle's family starts manipulating his life again, the odds turn against happiness for beautiful Belle and his beloved beast. </p>";
