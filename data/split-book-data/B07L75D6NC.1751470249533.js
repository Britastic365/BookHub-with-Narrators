window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>They’re back! </p> <p>When a simple \"find and fetch\" case throws Private Investigator Twig Starfig and newly minted wizard Quinn Broomsparkle into the middle of an EBI murder investigation, it’s just another day in the Elder Realm. </p> <p>If murder were Twig’s only problem, he’d be the luckiest half-dragon in the land. Murder he can handle. Fulfilling his promise to his scheming, power-hungry father to run for a seat on Lighthelm’s city council? Meh, he’d rather face a demon with a toothache. </p> <p>On top of their case going sideways and Twig running for a council seat he really doesn’t want, Twig and Quinn are forced to face some unpleasant realities about their budding romance while still learning how to handle the wizard-familiar bond they now share. Throw in a red fury with abysmal taste in boyfriends, a ghost pirate-parrot who drinks too much, a murderer who will stop at nothing to get what they want, and a host of new friends and enemies, and you’ve got a situation where no one is safe and everyone is fairy game. </p> <p>This audiobook is part of a series but can be litsened to as a stand-alone.</p>";
