window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Out of the wickedly inventive imagination of number-one <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author J.R. Ward comes a world where sin and salvation collide in a battle for the future of mankind - where a cynical fallen angel struggles against the seven deadly sins and a demon's lure over seven chosen souls.... </p> <p>Mels Carmichael, reporter for the <i>Caldwell Courier Journal,</i> gets the shock of her life when a man stumbles in front of her car outside the local cemetery. After the accident, his amnesia is just the kind of mystery she likes to solve, but she soon discovers they're in over their heads with his past. Over their heads with passion, too... </p> <p></p> <p>As shadows walk the line between reality and another realm, and her lover's memory begins to come back, the two of them learn that nothing is truly dead and buried. Especially when youre trapped in a no-holds-barred war between angels and demons. With a soul on the line, and Mels's heart at risk, what in Heaven - or in Hell - will it take to save them both?</p>";
