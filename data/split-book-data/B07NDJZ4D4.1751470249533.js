window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Anastasia</p> <p>I’m dead. He’s demonic. It never would have worked....</p> <p>Getting dumped by the Demon of my dreams wasn’t exactly in the game plan. Game plans suck. Throwing caution to the wind is my new motto.</p> <p>I used to be a semi-happily single Vampyre. As the Princess of the Australian Dominion, I have an enormous palace, a fabulous wardrobe, I don’t look a day over 30, and I have gobs of friends — most of whom would be happy to see me permanently deceased. However, they hide it well. In the violent world of the undead, I consider it a win.</p> <p>Getting kicked to the curb by my True Mate has turned my world upside-Down Under. Whatever. If the Demon doesn’t want me, fine. He can skip his butt right back to Hell.</p> <p>And if Levi thinks walking back into my life under the guise of ending the bad guy terrorizing my Dominion is gonna fly, he’s got a few electrocutions coming his way.</p> <p>He wants the bad guy.</p> <p>I want him.</p> <p>Game on.</p> <p>Levi</p> <p>Falling for Anastasia is a damned disaster.</p> <p>I’m a Demon. She’s a Vampyre.</p> <p>I don’t do feelings or relationships. I’m a killing machine with a bounty on my head. I have nothing to offer her. Period.</p> <p>I’m a dumbass for cutting her loose. But visions of the gorgeous Vampyre getting caught in the crossfire of idiots trying to whack my head off is unacceptable. While Anastasia is violent — an attribute I find wildly arousing — she didn’t sign up to be a target. The thought of her alive without me is far more appealing than her being permanently dead because of me. Of course, just when I thought I’d solved the problem by removing Anastasia from the equation, life — or rather, the pain in my backside, Satan — throws me back into her path.</p> <p>Behemoth is darkening Anastasia’s Dominion, and I’m going to need the Vampyre princess if I want to take him out.</p> <p>Two birds. One stone. Right?</p> <p>Kill Behemoth. Spend time with the woman I want, but I can’t have.</p> <p>Win-win. Kind of.</p> <p>Whatever. Blue balls, here I come.</p>";
