window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I didn’t think life could get any worse. Once you’ve gone to Hell, things should only look up, right? Wrong. Looking up is figuratively where my enemies wait to smite me. The angelic army might have stopped Hell from creating another level, but it’s not over. They haven’t won.<br> <br> And now they know it.<br> <br> With my soulmate missing and a new revelation threatening to send Heaven’s army our way to start the apocalypse, I have to find Elias and break two more angels. Unfortunately, it’s not as easy. Pride and sloth require different tactics. I have to prove that their purposes no longer follow Heaven’s path. They need to follow me down, even if I have to drag them to their thrones in Hell myself.</p>";
