window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>On the worst birthday of my life, I come home to find my boyfriend in bed with another woman. Within hours, I’m drunk, homeless, and pledging to stay single forever. And that is when the dangerously sexy Seelie King rolls through town, looking for fae like me. </p> <p>Every generation, the king holds a competition for Seelie queen. But for reasons he won’t explain, Torin is looking for a charade, not a real marriage. So when I drunkenly sling insults his way, I have his attention. </p> <p>When Torin offers me fifty million to participate, I think, “What have I got to lose?” The answer turns out to be “my life,” because my competition will literally kill for the crown. </p> <p>And the more time I spend with the seductive king, the harder it becomes to remember it’s all supposed to be fake. Now, my life—and my heart—are on the line. </p> <p>Performed by Taylor Coan, Alex Hill-Knight, Nazia Chaudhry, Stephanie Németh-Parker, John Kielty, Karen Novack, Jenna Sharpe, Yasmin Tuazon, Scott McCormick, Kay Eluvian, Nanette Savard, Zeke Alton, Nora Achrati, Khaya Fraites, K’Lai Rivera, Ken Jackson, Holly Adams and Eric Messner.</p>";
