window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>The devil is in the details....</i></p> <p>Cletus Byron Winston wishes to marry Jennifer Anne Donner-Sylvester (aka The Banana Cake Queen) posthaste! He’s spent the last year wanting nothing more than for the celebrations to be brief, libations flowing, and BYOB (bring your own blueberries). His future mother-in-law has other plans - plans his intended has been willing to indulge, much to Cletus’s chagrin. Therefore, so must he. To a point. But truth be told, he wouldn’t mind if the meddlesome matriarch disappeared, at least until the nuptials are over. </p> <p>On the night of Cletus and Jenn’s long-awaited engagement party, just when the surly schemer is of a mind to take matters into his own hands, a shocking event upends everyone’s best-laid plans and sends the small hamlet of Green Valley into complete disarray. The final months leading up to Cletus and Jenn’s matrimonial bliss are plagued with chaos and uncertainty. Will Cletus and Jenn finally make it to the altar? Or will murder and mayhem derail their happily-ever-after? And most importantly, who done it? </p> <p><i>Marriage and Murder </i>is the second book in the cozy mystery series Solving for Pie: Cletus and Jenn Mysteries. It is best enjoyed after the third book in the Winston Brothers series,<i> Beard Science </i>(which can be enjoyed as a stand-alone), and the first book in Solving for Pie: Cletus and Jenn Mysteries series, <i>Engagement and Espionage</i>.</p>";
