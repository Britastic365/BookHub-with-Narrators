window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Since a child, Elite Benson had been drawn to shiny, expensive, and beautiful things. His wife, Jacintha, was all three at once. In the beginning of their marriage, things were perfect, but with time they both began to change, and Elite soon realized his wife was not the woman he thought she was.</p> <p>Denali Peters was sure her life would never get any better. She had two children with a man who showed her with time just how impure his intentions were. At the top of her priority list was being a great mom, but working two jobs and raising her man along with their kids began to take a toll on Denali. Eventually, she realized the importance of self-care and her own happiness … but that happiness came with a hefty price.</p> <p>When Elite’s marriage crumbles, he decides to right a few wrongs from his past. During his quest for health and happiness, he meets Denali, who appears to be after the same things.
