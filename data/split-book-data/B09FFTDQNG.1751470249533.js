window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Xander, a blonde god, heartbreakingly beautiful.</b> </p> <p>He owned my heart. Once my hero, my best friend, my lover. Now quite possibly my enemy. I thought I could vanish, disappear until I found the strength to move on, find the will to survive after he incited a war in which there could be no winner. But I should have known, should have foreseen…there was no hiding from Xander. </p> <p><b>Sin, the devil incarnate, wickedly sexy.</b> </p> <p>He demanded my soul. Dominating as ever, Sin is relentless, but I refuse to relinquish control, vigilantly protecting the shattered remains of my heart in an effort to keep myself safe. Yet safety proves to be an illusion. A victim’s revenge escalates, the hunted now the hunter, forcing me back into a dangerous life I desperately wanted to escape, and soon, the killer isn’t the only one intent on drawing me out. </p> <p><b>Torn between heaven and hell, I was powerless against them.</b> </p> <p>Both men are demanding a decision. An impossible, life-altering choice I’m too frightened to consider, heightening the tension until it explodes without warning. Blurring the lines between the two men, Xander strips me of my defenses, leaving me breathless and begging for more. As the killer’s horrific conspiracy develops, Sin is just as merciless, his wicked games intensifying. Driving me to my knees in a desire so all-consuming, I’m left drowning until one terrifying, soul-shattering moment in time changes everything. </p> <p><b>AUTHOR'S NOTE: This book is intended for mature audiences due to explicit language and sexual content. Sinful is a ménage romance that's all about the girl. There are NO M/M scenes.</b> </p> <p><b>Shameless is not a stand-alone. </b></p> <p><b>The Sinful Surrender Quartet should be listened to in the following order: </b></p> <p><b><i>Sinful</i></b><b> (Available Now) </b><br> <b><i>Sensuous</i></b><b> (Available Now) </b><br> <b><i>Scandalous</i></b><b> (Available Now) </b><br> <b><i>Shameless</i></b><b> (This Title)</b></p>";
