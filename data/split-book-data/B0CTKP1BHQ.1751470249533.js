window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A love that burns brighter than starlight. A gift that could leave her world in ashes. It’s time for Zarya to release the fire within.</p> <p>In the jeweled city of Dharati, Zarya found passion and adventure for the first time. A mysterious stranger named Rabin helped to free the power within her—a dark, ancient magic that should not exist.</p> <p>Now, Zarya learns Rabin’s true identity. A warrior prince, born to rule, he is as deadly as he is beautiful. He’s also insufferable. Arrogant and superior, with dangerous secrets of his own.</p> <p>Zarya wants nothing to do with him. Terrifying demons are gathering beyond the walls and Zarya’s friends are rushing to complete a ceremony that will protect the city. Her mind is fixed on saving her home and finding the origin of her magic.</p> <p>But every discovery and every dream pulls her back to Rabin. Does an enchantment bind them, or is it pure desire? Will opening her heart give Zarya the power to turn back the demons, or will it let the darkness devour her?</p> <p>Dance of Stars and Ashes is the second book in an addictive series that builds from a slow burn to irresistible steamy romance. Packed with tension, action, and heart-stopping twists, it will keep fans of Sarah J. Maas, Jennifer L. Armentrout, and Rebecca Yarros listening late into the night.</p>";
