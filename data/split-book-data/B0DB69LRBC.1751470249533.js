window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>MULTI-CAST DUET NARRATION</p> <p>I never planned to fall for my skeleton-masked captor, but now there’s no turning back.</p> <p>I hated the gangs that ruled my city. After my friend was killed and my father vanished, I had no choice but to infiltrate one to figure out why. Entering their infamous club quickly showed me I was in over my head. Then the most feared gang leader took an interest in me. Arran was corrupt, deadly, and his searing gaze both terrified and tempted me. In my search for answers, I stumbled into his dark and dangerous game. The result? I belonged to him, with no chance of escape. In a heartbeat, I became Arran’s obsession. And in a terrible twist, I think he’s becoming mine.</p> <p>Shane East, Allie Rose, Ella Lynch, and Holden Maddox make up the incredible cast of the audiobook for Arran’s Obsession. Complete with duet recording and sound effects, this is the first book in an interconnected dark romance trilogy featuring a murder mystery, a dark city, an adult entertainment club, and a crew of men who are possessive over what’s theirs.</p> <p>Tropes:</p> <p>· A masked gang and an adult club</p> <p>· Possessive, damaged men</p> <p>· Dangerous play (including free use and predator/prey)</p> <p>· Forced proximity</p> <p>· Set entirely at night</p> <p>Check the TWs on my website if you need to (the list is as long as … it should be, dirty girl).</p>";
