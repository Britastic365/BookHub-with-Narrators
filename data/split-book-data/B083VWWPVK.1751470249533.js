That is until <i>she </i>moves into the abandoned house next door. I don't know what her intentions are, but she insists on being friends. So, being the good neighbor I am, I am more than happy to roll out the unwelcome mat for her. She needs to disappear and fast. All I want to do is continue my solitude and send the tiny woman on her way back to wherever she came from.</p> <p>Ugh, if it was only that easy.</p>";
