window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>For two FBI agents with a past, love becomes a matter of life and death in the new Hidden Sins novel from <i>New York Times</i> and <i>USA Today</i> bestselling author Katee Robert.</b> </p> <p>Maggie Gaines used to be an FBI agent - top of her class and one of the bright, up-and-coming stars - until she spectacularly fell apart during her first high-profile case. That was eight years ago. Now she's a ranger at Glacier National Park, and she's found some measure of peace. But when the body of a murdered woman is discovered, she must finally put the past behind her and work with the one man she thought she'd never see again. </p> <p>For months, Vic Sutherland has been hunting a killer who's been targeting unsuspecting hikers in national parks - and now the predator has come to Glacier. Vic knows the case will bring him face-to-face with his former partner, yet nothing can prepare him for seeing Maggie again after all these years, or for the memories of passion it stirs in both of them. </p> <p>As the investigation brings them closer together - and closer to the killer - Maggie and Vic fear they have only each other to trust. But even that might not be enough to make it out of Glacier alive. </p>";
