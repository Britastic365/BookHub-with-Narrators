She fears it will swallow her whole.</p> <p>Until he arrives, tugging an ancient thread deep within her soul.</p> <p>Theodore Kincaid seeks justice in Umbra but falls captive to his sworn enemy, the ruthless King Asher. Trapped in the kingdom that killed his beloved, his fate seems sealed until a chance encounter with the secret Queen of Umbra offers him an opportunity he can’t resist.</p> <p>Theo and the Queen each believe that they are in full control, but neither is prepared for what the fates have in store.</p> <p>Amidst a realm on the brink of chaos, two souls collide in a heart-wrenching tale of unveiling secrets, conquering the darkness, and igniting a love that could save or destroy.</p> <p>In The Shadows is the first book in a new series filled with forbidden romance, enemies-to-lovers, magical powers, fated mates, and political intrigue.
