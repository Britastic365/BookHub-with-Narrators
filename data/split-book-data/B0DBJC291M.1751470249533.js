window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"Wendy Darling, I have your brothers. You'll never see them again. They're in Neverland now.\"</b></p> <p>Isobel \"Bel\" Emerson finds her life disrupted once again when Eamon Stone receives a disturbing phone call from an old friend's daughter. Her family is in danger, but she can't call the police. Eamon is the only person she can turn to, and he agrees to help under one condition: Bel comes with him.</p> <p>Working undercover with only Eamon for backup, Bel arrives at Wendy Darling's expansive estate where she learns that both of Wendy's younger brothers have been kidnapped. Bel expects the kidnappings to be about the Darling's famous wealth, but what starts as a straightforward case turns deadly when a man known only as The Tinker turns the kidnapping into a dangerous game of cat and mouse. A game he forces them to play to the brutal end. No one is safe, not even Eamon's beast.</p> <p>As they race against the clock to find the lost boys, Bel's own kidnapping comes back to haunt her. She refuses to allow her past trauma to keep her from rescuing the missing kids, but when even the FBI fails to beat The Tinker's traps, Bel and Eamon are confronted with a terrifying reality. Saving the brothers might mean sacrificing their own lives.</p> <p>How far are they willing to go to save children from death? And are they brave enough to answer the question hanging thick between them before it's too late? Has Beauty fallen for the Beast?</p> <p><i>Loosely inspired by </i>Peter Pan, Kidnapping of a Myth <i>is book three in the Autopsy of a Fairytale series, a crime procedural romantic suspense perfect for those who like dark fairytales, murder mystery/crime procedurals (like AMC's The Killing, Netflix's Lucifer, NBC's Hannibal, and Criminal Minds), romance, found family, and a hint of fantasy. Each book will be based on a different fairytale, but Bel (and her Beast) will connect them all, her story ending on small cliffhangers in each book.</i></p>";
