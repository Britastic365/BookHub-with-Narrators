window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"Markus Del Reyes, I reject you.\" He left me no choice.</p> <p>I refuse to spend the rest of my life with my childhood bully for a mate. I may be a cursed shifter, incapable of shifting—but I wasn't desperate. Not till the Alpha Supreme cast me out of the House of Fire and Fluorite for rejecting his son.</p> <p>Now I'm packless. Homeless. No longer under the protection of a House. Until the dark vampire king of Blood and Beryl turns his sights on me.</p> <p>In return for protection from my former House, I have to become his fake mate. I'll be a queen and a fraud. It's a treacherous lie to live—and I find myself forgetting what's real and what's not with every stolen touch and heated kiss we share.</p> <p>What starts as a business arrangement turns complicated when my heat hits, and the king insists on being the one to help me through it.</p> <p>I've lost everything for doing what I know is right, but the greatest danger I ever faced was never losing my life . . . it was opening my cursed heart.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
