window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>My coven has remained hidden in the shadows for centuries.</p> <p>We’ve avoided the ‘real world’ altogether - hiding from monsters and other creatures we share this planet with.</p> <p>We found protection in the Colville National Forest, nestled in a town protected by magical barriers.</p> <p>Our powers are locked by an ancient curse, one meant to protect us from being found.</p> <p>Until now.</p> <p>The past has a way of repeating itself. A new game is beginning. No one is safe.</p> <p>He’s coming for me.</p> <p>He’s hunting.</p> <p>The monster we’ve run from for centuries has found us.</p> <p>How far will this deadly game go?</p> <p>How far will I be able to take it, or will he destroy me and everything I care about?</p> <p>Will the one thing I can’t live without be the key to destroying and undoing the past?</p> <p>Or will the past destroy me before I can save the people I love from what I’ve done?</p> <p>Warning: Intended for listeners 18 and older.</p> <p>About the hero: Chances are you may not fall instantly in love with him, that’s because I don’t write men you instantly love; you grow to love them. I don’t believe in instant love. I write flawed, raw, caveman-like assholes who eventually let you see their redeeming qualities. They are aggressive, assholes, and one step above a caveman when we meet them. You may not even like him by the time you finish this audiobook, but I promise you will love him by the end of this series. </p> <p>About the heroine: There is a chance that you might think she’s a bit naïve, or weak, but then again who starts out as a badass? </p> <p>Badasses are a product of growth and I am going to put her through hell, and you get to watch her come up swinging every time I knock her on her ass. That’s just how I do things. How she reacts to the set of circumstances she is put through may not be how you, as the listener, or I, as the author, would react to that same situation. Everyone reacts differently to circumstances and how Magdalena responds to her challenges is how I see her as a character and as a person. I don’t write love stories: I write fast-paced, knock you down, make you <i>sit on the edge of your seat wondering what happens next</i> books. If you’re looking for cookie-cutter romance, this isn’t for you. If you can’t handle the ride, unbuckle your seat belt and get out of the roller-coaster car now. If not, you’ve been warned. If nothing outlined above bothers you, carry on and enjoy the ride!</p>";
