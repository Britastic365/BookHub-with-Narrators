My family wrote the book on criminal organizations, and I’ll be ruling this place by the time the next moon rises.</p> <p>Then I just need to get to work on busting us the hell out of here. \"Us\" being me, the lion-shifter I’ve loved for 10 long years, and the most notorious criminal in here—a sinful incubus who’s been condemned to isolation for committing an unspeakable crime.</p> <p>What’s the worst that could happen? I mean, short of being rejected by my mate, the black-hearted werewolf who rules over my sworn enemies, or getting myself noticed by the sinister vampire guard who has a dark vendetta against me. But how likely is that?</p> <p>The trouble is, I need the help of those four alpha males to get out of here. And they happen to hate each other almost as much as they hate me.</p> <p>But I always did love a challenge. And I never did learn when to back down.</p> <p>So how hard could it be to make them accept me as their leader?</p>";
