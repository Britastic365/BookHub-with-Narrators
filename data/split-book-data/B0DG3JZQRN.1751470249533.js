window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Third time's the charm, right?</b></p> <p>At least that's what I tell myself when I witness the same hot guy commit mass murder three times in a few days. I'm either the luckiest mute boy ever or possibly the unluckiest.</p> <p>Who knows, maybe him kidnapping me will turn into the greatest love story ever told? Hey, it could happen! You never know how these things will turn out. I happen to believe in love and soulmates, and if nothing else, Arlington Fox doesn't treat my disability like a nuisance.</p> <p>It's not every day you find someone who just gets you, and I'm not going to look a gift horse in the mouth even if the horse in question is a man so good at killing people that I should probably introspect a bit about why that skews my moral compass and possibly my kinks. But c'mon, competence is sexy, am I right?</p> <p>The Trouble with Trying to Date a Murderer <i>is an MM paranormal romance with lots of sass, humor, a ridiculous 3000-year age gap, and an inordinate number of tables.</i></p> <p><i>Includes a bonus short story, \"Fox Recruits a Mute Boy (and Falls in Love).\"</i></p>";
