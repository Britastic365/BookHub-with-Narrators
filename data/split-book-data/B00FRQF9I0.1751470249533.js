window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>One beautiful bastard of a groom. The most beautiful bitch of a bride. A panty-ripping office hook-up turned true love everlasting. </p> <p>Wedding bells can't chime soon enough for Chloe Mills and Bennett Ryan. Chloe, exasperated and stressed by all the last-minute to-dos, is on the verge of saying \"I do\" to eloping. For his part, Bennett's so worried about being distracted by Chloe's body that he makes a no-sex-until-the-wedding-night rule that only seems to be making things worse by continually backfiring on him. As their crazy families descend for the big day - only a few of them actually trying to be helpful - the fiery lovers are about to test whether the couple that argues together can keep it together long enough to exchange rings, and not just heated words. </p>";
