It was one hell of a trick.</p> <p>She was raped and murdered in her apartment after attending a Halloween party with a bunch of art students. The killer did not use a condom or gloves, so the CSI team got a perfect DNA profile and two perfect thumbprints from her throat. A witness also saw her admit the killer to her apartment at 2:30 a.m. that night. It should have been a slam dunk. The only problem was, the DNA profile and the thumb prints didn’t match anyone on CODIS or IAFIS, or anyone at the party.</p> <p>The killer, who made no effort to hide his identity, had vanished without a trace–just like the one witness who might actually have known what happened that night. And 12 years later, the case is as cold as Sue Benedict and the icy December wind coming in off the East River.</p>";
