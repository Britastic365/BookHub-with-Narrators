window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I just want a quiet life on a beach with my mates to keep me busy. Is that too much to ask? Clearly, the answer to that question is yes.</p> <p>Maybe it was payback for the whole punching death in the face thing. Whatever the reason, Fate enjoyed creating chaos in my life, and then sitting back to watch the unfolding c--pfest with popcorn in hand. Ridgeforce and Midnight are coming to an end. What can I say? Burning things to the ground is sort of my thing. The only problem is that I’m not the only one who can rise from the ashes. It turns out that from the shambled remains of the two organizations that have been on mine and my mates' tails since the beginning, rises another threat.</p> <p>From my blood, they created the impossible. Mates were supposed to be given to us by Fate. They weren’t intended to be created in a lab. Take down the bad guys and live happily ever after: that is still a thing, right?</p> <p>Please note (spoilers ahead): This audiobook ends on a cliffhanger. To make up for that, there are some super spicy scenes with Ryls and her mates that you won't want to miss! There are also several fight scenes where people are unalived. There is one more audiobook in this series (Klutz: Phoenix Unleashed), and it will end with Ryls and her mates getting their happily ever after.</p>";
