window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>After my honorable discharge from the Marine Corps, it only made sense to put my skills to good use as a personal bodyguard.</b></p> <p>The contracts keep me moving and traveling, and the money is good. All I've ever wanted was to make sure my mother and sister were taken care of after my father passed away. So when Anthony Costello, the notorious mob boss and my dad's ex-employer, asked me to take on a special job for his family, I couldn't say no.</p> <p>But not even my six-year stint as an elite Marine could have prepared me for the hellscape that is being trapped in a secluded safe house with his son. Diablo Costello is a rude little chaos gremlin that lives to push all my buttons. I can't keep him safe if he's determined to fight me every step of the way. But I can see through the bratty facade. I know what Diablo needs. What he longs for. And God help me, I'm going to give it to him.</p>";
