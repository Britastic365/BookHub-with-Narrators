To survive, I did the only thing I could and forced myself to play the part of the perfect girlfriend. The perfect daughter. Because, no one wants someone broken.</p> <p>But now, the boy who owned my heart is a grown man - hardened and cold. Seeing Aidan four years later forces me to face my greatest fear, and realizing he is my fated mate only makes things worse. </p> <p>Secrets aren’t meant to stay buried, and fate always has a plan. That’s the funny thing about destiny. Right when you think everything is figured out, you get dealt a new hand.</p>";
