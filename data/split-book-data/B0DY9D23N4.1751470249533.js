But I don't want my sweet Hazel growing up the way I did. So I've continued putting up with Cole's indiscretions. But this time around, Cole crosses a line that he can't come back from. And I'm going to teach him a lesson he'll never forget.</p> <p>COLE</p> <p>I love my wife dearly, but she needs some serious help.</p> <p>Ever since her traumatic brain injury, she hasn't been the same. She's constantly accusing me of cheating on her. Yes, I've made mistakes, but that's in the past, and I've apologized for those. Now, I think she might even be following me to work. She's taking things too far. I don't know how much more of this I can handle. The only problem is, I'm afraid that if I try to leave her, she'll kill me.</p>";
