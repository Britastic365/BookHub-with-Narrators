And for as long as anyone alive remembers, the ghostly Harper Bride has walked the halls, singing lullabies at night. </p> <p>At 45, Rosalind Harper is a woman whose experiences have made her strong enough to bend without breaking - and weather any storm. A widow with three grown sons, she survived a disastrous second marriage, and built her In the Garden nursery from the ground up.</p> <p>Through the years, In the Garden has become more than just a thriving business - it is a symbol of hope and independence to Roz, and to the two women she shares it with.

Hired to investigate Roz's Harper ancestors, Dr. Mitchell Carnegie finds himself just as intrigued with Roz herself. And as they begin to unravel the puzzle of the Harper Bride's identity, Roz is shocked to find herself falling for the fascinating genealogist.</p> <p>Now it is a desperate race to discover the truth before the unpredictable apparition lashes out at the one woman who can help her rest in peace.</p>";
