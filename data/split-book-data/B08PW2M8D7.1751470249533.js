window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>“Why does this always happen to us?” (Quinn Broomsparkle, wizard extraordinaire) </p> <p>Six months have passed since wizard Quinn Broomsparkle left behind his indentured servant shackles. He’s in love with his half-dragon/half-fairy familiar, Twig Starfig. He’s got a home. Friends. A job. And a father-in-law he could do without. A pretty close to perfect life. But as Quinn has learned the hard way, things rarely stay peaceful for long. Especially when a Starfig’s involved. </p> <p>Summoned to his home realm and a past he’d thought left behind, Quinn and Twig find themselves in the middle of evil machinations...with no clear enemy. When Quinn’s younger brother, Zak, goes missing, it’s Starfig Investigations on the case. </p> <p>Being the first wizard in a thousand years isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. On top of a missing brother, a brokenhearted red fury, an archivist with a secret, and a ghost pirate-parrot who’s determined to return to his captain, Quinn and Twig’s relationship is sorely tested when questions - and unhappy answers - about their mating dilemma are pushed to the fore.</p> <p>All Quinn wants is his fairy share of happiness. Is that so much to ask?</p>";
