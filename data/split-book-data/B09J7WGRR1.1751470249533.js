Unicorn. </p> <p>All Dusk wants out of life is for his band to become world famous. He also wants to have a lot of fun along the way. And to get his rocks off. When he wants something, he goes for it, consequences be damned. </p> <p>So when he sees a gorgeous pink-haired guy who is the human equivalent of tattooed cotton candy, he can’t help but have a taste. But it’s when Lolly ends up on their tour bus that Dusk knows their meeting was destiny. </p> <p>Abe is the kind of guy who goes with the flow. He was hitchhiking anyway, so why not spend the week with a hot piece of rocker beefcake, getting smothered by his sexy long hair? And why not play the part of the supportive cutie while he’s at it? It’s not like he’d be sticking around for long anyway. </p> <p>All plans hit a wall when photos of Abe and Dusk emerge online, suddenly pushing the band into the spotlight. To take advantage of the sudden popularity, the band offers Abe money for staying. </p> <p>Which means money for being in a fake relationship with Dusk. </p> <p>Which isn’t even fake. </p> <p>Or is it? </p> <p>Possible spoilers: <br> <b>Themes: </b>rock band, alternative lifestyles, tattoos, bisexuality, commitment, instalove, abandonment issues, fame, outing, coming out, life on tour <br> <b>Genre:</b> Contemporary M/M Rocker Romance <br> <b>Heat level:</b> Scorching hot scenes</p>";
