window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I had the chance to leave these lands and avoid the war—but I chose to stay.</p> <p>I chose to stay because if I don't keep Harlow safe, she'll die. The demons are a foe too powerful, invulnerable to Huntley's fire-breathing dragons, a fiend so untouchable that HeartHolme and the other kingdoms stand no chance.</p> <p>I tried so hard to fight it, restrained my emotions from the first time we were together, but the inevitable has come to pass. I've fallen hard for this woman—<i>a human</i>. I've chosen to risk my immortality for her even though she wouldn't forsake her humanity for me. When this war is over, we'll go our separate ways… and never see each other again.</p> <p>Huntley and I are forced to work together to save his kingdom, and his hatred for me is slowly replaced by something else… respect. I've always been close with my father, but now I realize it's only because our politics are aligned. What Huntley feels for his family is genuine… unconditional.</p> <p>Now I fight for more than just Harlow. I fight for her family… like they're my own.</p>";
