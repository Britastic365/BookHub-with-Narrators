window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Caught between my painful past and my impossible future, I find myself once again in Axel's clutches. My heart lies with the three rough men who took me in, but is that dream an impossible reality? Even more impossible is the decision ahead. No matter what he says, I can't trust Axel after what he did. </p> <p>Can I? </p> <p>When he sets out to prove himself worthy of repairing our bond, I'm pulled in two directions. My wolf wants her mate, but my human side wants the triplets who bring danger and excitement of their own. As I learn to navigate the human world, wolf law, and the tension between my three biker lovers and my rejected mate, I only grow more confused. I know I'll have to choose soon. But how can I make a choice between my wolf and my human heart?</p> <p><b>This is book two in a steamy, mildly kinky, why-choose romance series. All characters are over 18 and all sexytimes are consensual. Recommended for listeners 18+.</b></p>";
