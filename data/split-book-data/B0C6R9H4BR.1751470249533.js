window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>It started as a deadly game long before I was born.</b></p> <p>When a bullet takes my memories and the life of my friend, I return to the one place that offers me safety.</p> <p>The monster that hunts me outside these gates has nothing on the demons inside them. Their darkness holds me captive, drawing me in and stealing pieces of me I can’t afford to lose. With no memory of my past and an uncertain future, the girl they crave is just an illusion.</p> <p>Love can be lethal but then so can I. When the real me wakes up, it’s with fire in my blood and the taste of deceit on my tongue. White lies and red flags blur the lines between justice and vengeance.</p> <p>The game isn’t over till someone wins—or until they beg for mercy.</p> <p>Please be advised that this book may cause shallow breathing, exploding ovaries, and spontaneous disintegration of panties. Intended for mature listeners.</p>";
