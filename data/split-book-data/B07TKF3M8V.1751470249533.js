window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A dead body.</p> <p>A missing daughter.</p> <p>A silver blade.</p> <p>All the clues point to one person: Me.</p> <p>My name is Evangeline, and I’m a retired assassin who wants nothing to do with the underworld. But an edict from a Demonic Lord forces me to return to the man and the life I left behind.</p> <p>I have seven days to prove my innocence.</p> <p>Whoever set me up is going to die.</p> <p>“Xai…”</p> <p>His fingers knotted in my ponytail as he yanked my head back to the angle he preferred.</p> <p>Oh, I knew that look. Nothing good ever came from that look.</p> <p>I flattened my palms against his bare chest, but he pushed right through my physical barrier and took my mouth with a ferocity that screamed possession. His tongue demanded entrance, and when I tried to fight him, he bit my lip hard enough to bleed. On my gasp, he entered and unleashed his desire in a kiss that deprived me of oxygen.</p> <p>My knees threatened to buckle under his assault. He took my mouth the way he did my body, reminding me who we were to each other with a few bold strokes. I melted for him, as I always did.</p> <p>God, I missed this.</p> <p>I missed him.</p> <p>I hated it. Loved it. Craved it....\"</p> <p>Daughter of Death is a standalone paranormal romance with dark elements, demons, angels, a sadistic alpha male, blood, and a lot of dead bodies. What can I say? Eve likes her knives, and Xai enjoys watching her play.</p>";
