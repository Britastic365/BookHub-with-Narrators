window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When she swears off casual sex because she falls too hard, too fast, he’ll be the one to convince her to break her own rules.<br> <br> I’m a hopeless romantic who loves making love, and I often fall for guys who don’t want to be serious. So, I promise myself no more one-night stands and no more heartbreak. But when I sneak away from a boring work party, only to end up sleeping with the handsome guy from the hotel bar, I fail at the first step in my new plan.<br> <br> When I get up in the morning, I stick to my strategy, and I don’t ask for his phone number or his last name. Even if he did give me a night I’ll never forget, I’m determined to be strong. Except he turns out to be my new roommate, and now, he’s living with me.<br> <br> But I’m not sure I can avoid falling in love—again—when the very man I want to avoid is always right there.</p>";
