window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>What do you get when you have four mates, one psychotic prince, a horde of rebels, and a cupid who just got yanked out of the realm?</p> <p>A big freaking problem, that’s what.</p> <p>I was supposed to take on my first real mission as a spy. I was supposed to go find my missing mate and discover who our real allies are for the war that’s brewing in the fae realm.</p> <p>Instead, I’m thrown back to where I was first created, Cupidville. And, judging by the look I’m getting from the Head of all Cupidity, and the big Terminate button that he's holding, this problem is about to get much worse.</p> <p>The thing is, I’m more of a lover than a fighter, but when it has to do with staying with my mates, this cupid might just cut a bitch. I’ve waited my entire existence to find love, and now that I have it, I’m not going to give it up without a fight.</p> <p><b>Author's note: </b>This is the third book of the Heart Hassle series. This is a reverse harem story and includes sexually explicit scenes and mature language. Intended for ages 18 years and older.</p>";
