window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Eli: A goddess told me my child would change the pack. Until it happened, I didn't believe it. Not until I saw it with my own eyes.</b></p> <p>My woman is a nurturer. She's a bringer of change. A <i>broker</i> of the future. She deals with emotions, sees auras, and glories in the urges of her three alpha mates. To me, she's the saint. But that doesn't make me or my brothers sinners. We were fated to be together, fated to be different. There's nothing sinful in what we have, even if, in the eyes of her family, we're a disgrace.</p> <p>She's Roma, born and bred, and harkens from a rich culture as ancient as my own. With her heritage comes gifts I could never have foreseen...not just for her, but for her siblings as well. Two are dead, the other has yet to be found. But uncovering family secrets is always dangerous without throwing mystical powers into the fray. And these mystical powers will change everything.</p> <p>A revolution is underway. We're not prepared for it. We can't be. Are you?</p>";
