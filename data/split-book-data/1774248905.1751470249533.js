window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A friendly face and laughing heart…will be what tears her soul apart.</b></p> <p>Finally accepting that there would be no leaving Harrow Faire, Cora sets out to try to find her new way of life as part of the family. With that comes her slow acceptance of her attraction toward and, even worse, her feelings for the Puppeteer. But just as things seemed to be falling into a pattern, they turn upside down - seemingly literally - as Harrow Faire enters “the Inversion”.</p> <p>Cora's troubles don’t end there; the mute Clown takes a keen interest in her, one that she doesn’t understand...until it’s too late. Mr. Harrow took her from her life to become the Contortionist. But it seems the Faire itself has other plans.</p>";
