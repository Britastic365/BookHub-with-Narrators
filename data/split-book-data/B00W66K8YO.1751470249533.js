window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When Skye Madden is caught trespassing at an exclusive ski resort while trying to support herself as a tabloid photographer, she is stunned to discover that her childhood crush, Aidan Hastings, is the head of security. More shocking still, Aidan tells her in no uncertain terms that if she is found snooping around the resort again he'll take her over his knee and give her a spanking she'll never forget. </p> <p>When her boss sends her back to the same resort a year later on another assignment, Skye can't help but remember Aidan's warning. But a spanking quickly becomes the least of her worries after she gets lost on the mountain. While trying to find her way back, things go from bad to worse when she witnesses a cold-blooded murder, and she is left with no choice but to confess everything to Aidan. Worst of all, it appears that the murder is connected to the Russian mob. </p> <p>Aidan decides he's taking no chances with his best friend's little sister, a girl he's never been able to forget. As a former special agent, he is more than ready to do whatever is needed to keep her safe, even if that means taking her into hiding in an isolated cabin. But Skye Madden has grown even more stubborn and headstrong than he remembered, and he soon realizes it will take quite a bit more than just a bare-bottom spanking to bring her in line. </p> <p>Even with her world collapsing around her, Skye wonders how she can let this man - someone who has a place called a \"punishment room\" in his house - start to claim her heart again. Can she learn to trust her firm protector, or will she take matters into her own hands and put her life in even greater danger? </p> <p>Publisher's Note: <i>Protective Custody</i> is an erotic novel that includes spankings, sexual scenes, anal play, elements of BDSM, and more. If such material offends you, please don't buy this book. </p>";
