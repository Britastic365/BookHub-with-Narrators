window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>She hated him the moment they met. Burned by love, Lettie is finally ready to date again after a long, self-imposed hiatus from men. But Vore is everything Lettie abhors. The arrogant prick with his big—um, ah—ego is a self-proclaimed ladies’ man and totally not her type. And her body totally doesn’t tingle every time he flashes her his fangs. Nope!</p> <p>“Love them and leave them.” That’s what Vore has always said. Why play with feelings when the females he meets only think of mercenaries as one-night stands? Vore lives for the chase, so when the tiniest human female he had ever met tells him off and claims he’s not her type, Vore takes it as a challenge to get her in his bed. And Vore always gets what he wants!</p> <p>With only a few days before his ship leaves the colony for the next mission, will Vore be able to win Lettie’s heart and teach her to love again? Or will he steal her away and claim her as his mate?</p> <p>Can be listened to as a stand-alone or as part of the series. Growly mercenary and steamy scenes ahead. Intimacy is not hidden behind closed doors in the Tallean culture, so please don't download this audiobook if this idea offends you.</p> <p>HEA guaranteed.</p>";
