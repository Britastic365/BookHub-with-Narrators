His life has been infused with darkness and trauma since the day he was born, forcing more than just desensitization to violence and chaos. Forcing him to crave it to feel stable. Secure. Whole.</p> <p>With only a handful of people he cares about, his family, the ones that don his cut, women are just a tool, a means to an end. Never to covet, only to use. Each one blends into the next.</p> <p>The formula he lives by is simple.</p> <p>Death is at your door. You are a soldier of bedlam.</p> <p>Nothing more, nothing less…</p> <p>Until the moment a little hummingbird flies into his crosshairs, forcing him to feel something he hasn't felt for as long as he can remember… alive.</p> <p>Let the hunt begin.</p> <p><i>Narrated in duet style.</i></p>";
