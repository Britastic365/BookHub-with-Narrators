Despite who her parents are, she's determined to prove she belongs there. After getting informed by her step-father, Admiral Ravenmore, that she's a target for multiple enemies, he assigns Operator Creature as her personal security to watch over her while she's on deployment.

After avoiding his demise once, he runs into a different kind of one—his boss's daughter.</p> <p>Pretend <i>can be enjoyed as a standalone. It does end on a cliffhanger.
