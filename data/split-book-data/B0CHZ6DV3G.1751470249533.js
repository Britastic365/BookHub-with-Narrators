window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A sweet, spicy romp brought to you by the author of </b><b><i>Mercenary Princess</i></b><b> and the Guardians of the Realms series.</b></p> <p>Eva has been in love with her dad’s best friend since she was a teenager. Logan is everything she craves. He’s smart, successful, kind, and mind-numbingly hot—no matter that he’s nearly twice her age. Her relentless obsession has kept her from wanting anyone else, and her fantasies have twisted until all she can imagine is him slipping into her room at night to do dirty things to her. Knowing she desperately needs to get over Logan, she schedules an appointment at a club where a “daddy” might fulfill all her fantasies and end her fixation on the one man she can never have.</p> <p>Logan’s number one rule is never to date a woman closer to his daughter’s age than to his own. No matter how much Eva tempts him, she can never be anything more than the sweet girl he looks out for now that her parents have moved away.</p> <p>But when Logan’s daughter shares the details of what innocent Eva has planned, he’s faced with the choice to break his number one rule and betray his best friend or allow Eva to do something that could put her in harm’s way. Can he be her “daddy”<i> </i>for a night, or will crossing that line lead to more than he bargained for?</p>";
