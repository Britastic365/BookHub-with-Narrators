window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The next thrilling instalment in the Underworld Gods series. Perfect for listeners who want high steam Hades/Persephone and Beauty and the Beast vibes with a dark Nordic folklore twist.</p> <p>All Hanna Heikkinen wants is to be reunited with her father again. After all, that's why she ventured into the dark and dangerous fantasy world of Tuonela, the Land of the Dead, in order to save his life. But this time her devotion to her father comes at a cost—her growing relationship with Tuoni, the God of Death himself, who held Hanna captive in exchange for her father's life. The last thing she expects is to feel remorse, yet the dark and sexy God is all she can think about.</p> <p>Death has always prided himself on never trusting the living, but Hanna's apparent betrayal has left a scar fathoms deep. Vowing revenge on his future bride, and making sure she upholds her end of the bargain, Death sets out across his realm to steal Hanna back. But Death and Hanna aren't just fighting each other—malevolent Old Gods are rising to power within the realm, magic is being poisoned, and buried secrets are brought to light, secrets that may cause Hanna to lose everyone she loves dear once again.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
