window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The highly anticipated standalone from the award-winning, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of the Graceling Realm series - a kaleidoscopic novel about grief, adventure, storytelling, and finding yourself in a world of seemingly infinite choices.</b> </p> <p>Jane has lived an ordinary life, raised by her aunt Magnolia - an adjunct professor and deep sea photographer. Jane counted on Magnolia to make the world feel expansive and to turn life into an adventure. But Aunt Magnolia was lost a few months ago in Antarctica on one of her expeditions. </p> <p>Now, with no direction, a year out of high school, and obsessed with making umbrellas that look like her own dreams (but mostly just mourning her aunt), she is easily swept away by Kiran Thrash - a glamorous, capricious acquaintance who shows up and asks Jane to accompany her to a gala at her family's island mansion called Tu Reviens. </p> <p>Jane remembers her aunt telling her: \"If anyone ever invites to you to Tu Reviens, <i>promise me</i> that you'll go.\" With nothing but a trunkful of umbrella parts to her name, Jane ventures out to the Thrash estate. Then her story takes a turn, or, rather, five turns. What Jane doesn't know is that Tu Reviens will offer her choices that can ultimately determine the course of her untethered life. But at Tu Reviens, every choice comes with a reward, or a price. </p> <p>Listen to <i>Jane, Unlimited</i> and remember why the <i>New York Times</i> has raved, \"Some authors can tell a good story; some can write well. Cashore is one of the rare novelists who do both.\" </p>";
