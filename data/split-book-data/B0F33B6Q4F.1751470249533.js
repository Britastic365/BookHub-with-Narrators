window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Revisit Hidden Hollow for another cozy, spicy Monster Romance...</p> <p>Hi, I’m Celia. I’m a kitchen witch and I run The Lost Lamb bakery in Hidden Hollow, a small New England town where it’s almost always Autumn. I just turned forty—it’s not a very happy birthday since I’m all alone but to my surprise, I got a very unusual birthday gift—a huge portrait of a handsome demon whose eyes seem to follow me wherever I go.</p> <p>Living with magic for years makes me discount the strange gift, but maybe I shouldn’t. Is the demon watching me from the portrait? Is my boring life about to get incredibly weird and extremely spicy? You’ll have to listen to Dreaming of the Demon to find out.</p> <p>Because in Hidden Hollow…anything is possible.</p> <p>Author’s Warning—This book contains a h0rny, lonely baker, an irresistible Incubus with a naughty tail, magic pastries that make you sing and have hot, dirty sex, and a Pilgrim 0rgy. Listen at your own risk!</p> <p>Author’s Note #1—This short novel is not Hidden Hollow book 2, it’s more like a fun little interlude between the main books in the series and it can be listened to as a STAND ALONE. It's not as long as my usual books, so I have priced it less than usual. I hope you enjoy listening to it as much as I enjoyed writing it.</p> <p>What you’ll get in this Spicy, Small Town Monster Romance</p> <p>Spicy times with an actual Plot</p> <p>A handsome Incubus who’s eager to please and has a tail that stings in all the right places</p> <p>A Pilgrim orgy</p> <p>All kinds of Creatures including Centaurs, Krakens, Witches, Demons, Ogres and more</p> <p>A HEA Ending that will give you the warm fuzzies</p>";
