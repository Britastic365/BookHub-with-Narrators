window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Victoria’s a necromancer, fairy, Blood Queen…hot freaking mess. Her identity is so twisted up in supernatural nonsense that all she wants to do is go back to embalming bodies and coffin brochures. Being in love should make things easier, but when your beau’s a bear and you’ve got a fairy suitor waiting in the wings, romance is just another complication. While preparing the victims of a tragic fire for their funerals, Victoria discovers that their deaths were not accidents, as the police have ruled. Soon, she’s hot on the trail of a Firestarter who’s been scorching their way through the surrounding counties. It’s about more than murder and flame, though.</p> <p>Bodies with their hearts missing. A dark coven. And a gate to hell. It’s not long before Victoria goes from the hunter to the hunted. But she’ll do whatever it takes to bring the arsonist to justice—even if that means getting a few burns along the way</p>";
