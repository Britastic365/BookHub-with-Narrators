window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Former agent Frank Compton races across the galaxy to prevent an evil group mind from acquiring powerful alien artifacts in the action-packed second installment of the Quadrail series from Hugo Award-winning author Timothy Zahn</b></p> <p>Frank Compton saved the universe once—and for that he must die. Having temporarily stalled the Modhri, a sinister alien group intelligence, in its evil schemes for universal domination, the former Western Alliance Intelligence operative just wants to relax in first class with his stunning, half-human partner, Bayta, aboard the worlds-linking intra-galactic transportation system, the Quadrail. But when their peace is disturbed by an annoying human passenger spinning wild tales of alien art objects, and the pest is discovered dead soon after, Compton and Bayta realize there can be no rest. The galaxy remains in grave danger.</p> <p>Now on a mission to find ancient sculptures, relics of a long-extinct alien civilization, Compton must elude a relentless special agent who believes him to be a murderer. But that's only the tip of the iceberg, for everything ties into the Modhri's secret war against all the planets along the Quadrail lines—and the enemy’s unique ability to enslave the minds of every creature it comes into contact with means an assassin could be anywhere . . . or anyone.</p>";
