window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Finally find out what happened during those missing four months, as the thrilling adventure continues!</p> <p>He’s under my skin…</p> <p>After Katmere, I shouldn’t be surprised by anything. Including the existence of a world beyond my world called the Shadow Realm. Yet here I am, stuck in a strange, dangerous place with the worst of the supernaturals, the monster that other monsters fear: Hudson Vega. He might be Jaxon’s brother and ridiculously hot, but he’s a complete bona fide pain in my ass.</p> <p>The question is whether we’ll find a way out before I kill him…or run out of time.</p> <p>She’s stealing my heart…</p> <p>It’s a truth universally known―at least according to Grace―that everything is my fault. But I have a nasty suspicion that Grace isn’t as human as she thinks, and she’s the one keeping us trapped. Now we’ll have to work together not only to survive, but to save all those we’ve come to call family who live here.</p> <p>Because there’s something connecting us. Something stronger than fear…and way more bloody dangerous.</p> <p>Adapted from the novel and produced with a full cast of actors, immersive sound effects and cinematic music!</p> <p>Performed by Melody Muze, Stewart Crank, Nathaniel Priestley, Morgan Dalla Betta, Karen Novack, Matthew Pauli, Eric Messner, Taylor Coan, Jonathan Sleep, Nanette Savard, Rob McFadyen, LaMont Ridgell, Lucy Symons, Kelly Baskin, Devon Lexington, Julian Dailey, Andrew Arceus, Rana Kay, Ryan Haugen, Rita Amparita, and Drew Kopas.</p>";
