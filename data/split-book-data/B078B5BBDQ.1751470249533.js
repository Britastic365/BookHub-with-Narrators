But is she too late?</p> <p>As the Everlife descends into darkness, a single truth becomes clear: Troika and Myriad must unite - or perish. In order to bring sworn enemies together, Ten must enter forbidden territory...and destroy the powerful Prince of Ravens. But there's only one way inside - bonding with Killian Flynn, a deadly rival who sets her blood aflame.</p> <p>When nothing goes as planned and betrayal leads to the edge of utter defeat, Ten and Killian will have to rebuild trust from the ashes of their hearts. Victory seems impossible, the odds stacked against them. In the end, how far will they be willing to go for the sake of their realms and the Everlife?</p>";
