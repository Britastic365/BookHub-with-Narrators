She loves Hello Kitty, and she gets under my skin like nobody else.</p> <p>As if that’s not bad enough, the minute we step on deck, she thinks that certain people on the yacht are up to something shady - based completely on her soap opera knowledge.</p> <p>She won’t listen when I tell her she’s being ridiculous.</p> <p>But as the days go by, I find that we’re actually having fun.
