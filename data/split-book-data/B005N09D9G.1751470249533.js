For him, nothing stands in the way of victory. Until Kaia, an enchanting Harpy, tempts him to the razor’s edge of surrender. </p> <p>Known among her people as The Disappointment, Kaia must bring home the gold in the Harpy Games or die.

But as the competition heats up, only one prize will matter - the love neither had thought possible.</p>";
