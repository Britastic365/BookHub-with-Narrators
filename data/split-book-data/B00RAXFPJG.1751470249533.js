window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The climactic third novel in <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Jeaniene Frost's Night Prince series finds Vlad and his newly turned bride, Leila, at odds with each other - and vulnerable to the one vampire powerful enough to end the Dark Prince's reign... </p> <p>Play with fire, pay the price </p> <p>Leila's years on the carnie circuit were certainly an education. What she didn't learn: how to be a vampire, or how to be married to the most famous vampire of them all. Adjusting to both has Leila teetering on a knife edge between passion and peril, and now the real danger is about to begin... </p> <p>Vlad must battle with a centuries-old enemy whose reach stretches across continents and whose strength equals his own. It isn't like Vlad to feel fear, but he does... for Leila, because his enemy knows she is Vlad's greatest weakness. As friend and foe alike align against him - and his overprotectiveness drives Leila away - Vlad's love for his new bride could be the very thing that dooms them both... </p>";
