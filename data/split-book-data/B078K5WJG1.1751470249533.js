window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Gay werewolves in Victorian London? Why yes, yes there are.</b></p> <p>Biffy, newly minted Alpha of the London Pack, is not having a good Christmas. His Beta abandoned him, his werewolves object to his curtain choices, and someone keeps leaving babies on his doorstep.</p> <p>Professor Randolph Lyall returns home to London after 20 years abroad, afraid of what he might find. With his pack in chaos and his Alpha in crisis, it will take all his Beta efficiency to set everything to rights. Perhaps, in the process, he may even determine how to mend his own heart.</p> <p><i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Gail Carriger presents a charming love story set in her popular steampunk Parasolverse. Featuring the long-awaited reunion between everyone's favorite quietly capable Beta and the werewolf Alpha dandy who let him slip away.</p> <p>This sweet romance is full of unexpected babysitting, holiday decorations, and no small amount of pining. Look for surprise appearances from popular side characters and the occasional strategic application of italics.</p> <p>The Supernatural Society novellas stand alone and may be read in any order. But if you're a stickler, this story chronologically follows Imprudence, and ties specifically to events in Timeless. </p> <p><b>Delicate Sensibilities?</b></p> <p>Contains men who love other men and have waited decades to do so.</p>";
