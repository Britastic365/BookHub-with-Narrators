window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Whips and chains - not optional.</b></p> <p><b>Sid.</b></p> <p>Drummer for The Underdogs. Secretly yearning for pain and submission.</p> <p><b>Asher. aka. Stan.</b></p> <p>Stalker. More than meets the eye. It’s hard to find good hookups while on tour.</p> <p>Sid wants pain, humiliation, and the kind of sex that isn’t easy to get from one-night stands. So, for now, he’s given up, settled for an online Dom to get his rocks off, and focused on his band instead. The Underdogs are getting increasingly popular, but there is one fan who has followed Sid since before he even joined the band, and he’s driving Sid mad! Rich, spoiled hipster brat looking for the bad-boy experience. If he knew what Sid was really into, he would run for the hills.</p> <p>Asher is convinced that Sid is the One - his one true love - his endgame. Years ago, Asher lost his virginity to Sid, and from that moment on, he knew it was meant to be. They had a spark, that honest connection that couldn’t be faked. The members of Sid’s band call him a stalker, but all he wants is to offer Sid his love. When Sid finally chokes out what he wants, Asher is more than ready to unleash it on him. But, the last time Sid was out as gay and submissive, he got badly burnt when his former band kicked him out, and the doors to many opportunities slammed in his face. Asher wants the whole world to know that he’s dating Sid. Problem is, Sid would much rather keep the relationship as pain-with-benefits.</p> <p><b>Themes: rock band, alternative lifestyles, tattoos, BDSM, commitment, family issues, coming out, life on tour, friends with benefits become something more, first love, stalking, fanboy</b></p>";
