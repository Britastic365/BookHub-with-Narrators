Now, the only way I can save the empire I built is to inherit the title I've never wanted - so I need a wife. </p> <p>To take my mind off business I need a night that's all pleasure. I need to bury myself in a stranger. </p> <p>The skim of Scarlett King's hair over my body as she bends over... </p> <p>The scrape of her nails across my chest as she screams my name... </p> <p>The bite of her teeth on my shoulder just as we both reach the edge... </p> <p>It all helps me forget. </p> <p>I just didn't bargain on finding my one night stand across the boardroom table the next day. </p> <p>She might be my latest conquest but I have a feeling Scarlett King might just conquer me. </p> <p><i>A sexy, stand-alone romance. </i></p> <p>For Harper and Max's story, listen to<i> King of Wall Street</i>. </p> <p>For Violet and Alexander's story, listen to <i>The British Knight</i>. </p> <p>For Darcy and Logan's story, listen to <i>The Earl of London</i>. </p> <p>For Grace and Sam's story, listen to <i>Park Avenue Prince</i>.</p>";
