Their successes have made headlines from Tokyo to Turin to Tulsa.<br><br>But some mysteries require deeper investigation—enigmas so puzzling that they’ve defied the explanations of history, science, and faith for millennia. Enter the IAA’s top two researchers, Alex Simms and Tara Watson, among the brightest, most dogged investigators ever to unearth a secret.<br><br>This husband-and-wife duo has played a key role in every major success at the agency, but they’ve never been tested like this before. Their first assignment? To track down and stop a resurgent order of neo-Nazis who believe a cache of ancient stones holds the key to a new, eternal German Reich. Alex and Tara—whose “weapons” normally include computers, lab equipment, and reference books—are about to face an entirely new brand of war: in the real world, against real criminals…with real guns.<br><br>They’ll need every bit of skill, luck, and maybe a miracle to stop these madmen who are hell-bent on opening Hell’s Gate. USA Today best-selling author Ernest Dempsey, creator of the popular Sean Wyatt series, unlocks a new realm of danger in this, his first in a new collection of thrillers.<br><br>Archaeology has gone paranormal.<br><br>Ernest Dempsey has written and published archaeological thrillers since 2010 and his catalog continues to grow every year.
