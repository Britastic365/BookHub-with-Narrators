That's not a fling. This might be getting serious. I think about him all the time. I look forward to our quickie lunch dates and the way he whispers in my ear every night from 2,000 miles away. He's the best boyfriend I <i>never</i> had. </p> <p>Until I find out his name isn't Lonnie, it's Alonzo. </p> <p>Until I find out he's not some boring accountant with a dead-end job, he's a six-foot-four, yoked-out, tatted-up fisherman who never wears a shirt! That's right, girls. He's been catfishing me online for two...freaking...years! </p> <p>And then he becomes more than just the best boyfriend I've never had. He becomes my target.</p> <p><b>Alonzo</b></p> <p>Tara Tanner is the perfect long-distance girlfriend who lives in the Land of Far, Far Away. She's a blonde, bookish bundle of sexy-overachiever. A wicked little siren with a filthy mind and an eye for pencil skirts.

It's a long-distance fling filled with dirty-talking, sexy selfies, and safely hidden secrets...until it isn't. Until the day they meet and realize.... Love in the Land of fake Far, Far Away can't ever compare to the real thing.</i></p>";
