window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Four cursed warriors. One vampire-hunting detective. This sexy, kick-ass reverse harem series will keep you up all night...</b><br> <br> This boxed set contains all four books in the Her Dark Protectors series: Cursed by Night, Kissed by Night, Hidden by Night, and Broken by Night. If you like snarky detectives, badass warriors, HOT sex scenes, and thrilling action, this is the series for you!<br> <br> Description from Book One:<br> <br> <b>My name is Ace Bissett, and I’m a paranormal detective who doesn’t believe in magic. </b><br> <br> Or at least, I didn’t before I met <i>them</i>.<br> <br> The day I inherited my aunt’s old house, everything changed. One moment, I was convinced that magic was a hoax. The next, I’m surrounded by four winged, fanged, ridiculously hot guys who are definitely not human, and who insist that I'm the only one who can break the curse that binds them to the night.<br> <br> I know I should run far, far away from this hot mess, but there's a connection between us I can't deny. I'm seeing things I can't explain, feeling things that don't make sense. The detective in me has never been able to resist a mystery, and this one is just begging me to dig in.<br> <br> But all that will have to wait, because there’s a new threat stalking my city. One with a taste for blood and bone, unable to be killed or captured by normal human means. It’s a good thing I’ve got four new roommates to help me hunt them down. But even if I didn’t, I’d figure out a way.<br> <br> Because I never give up. I never give in. And I <i>always</i> protect what’s mine.</p>";
