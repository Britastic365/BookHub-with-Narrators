He decided tonight was my wedding night, so it was. All he let me choose was the dress he would tear off me later.</p> <p>When I told him I wanted him to be gentle, he laughed at me, then ripped off my panties. I shouldn't have been wet. I shouldn't have moaned. But I was, and I did.</p> <p>When he threw me on the bed, I told him I'd never be his no matter how he made me scream. He just smiled. The kind of smile that said this was going to hurt and he was going to enjoy every moment of it. Then he bent down and whispered something in my ear that shook me to my core.</p> <p>\"You're already mine. You always have been.\"</p> <p><b>Publisher's Note</b>: <i>Bride</i> includes spankings, rough, intense sexual scenes, and strong D/s themes.
