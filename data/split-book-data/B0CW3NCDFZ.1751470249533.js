window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>An all new duet narrated multicast series from USA Today best-selling authors Meg Anne and K. Loraine.</p> <p><b>I would scorch the earth for the woman I love.</b><br> <br> Being a dragon had always been my legacy. But not one I wanted anything to do with. After losing control the first time I shifted, I’d been exiled off to Blackwood, left to rot in the shame of my crimes.<br> <br> I was meant to be a hero. A protector. The defender of my fae homeland. Instead I became the scary story they told their children at night.<br> <br> Believing I belonged in this prison, I never considered a future beyond my punishment. Not until I met my mate. Dahlia is a gift I didn’t think I deserved and now I want more with her. We all do.<br> <br> <b>Her beastly Viking</b><br> <b>Her mad pirate</b><br> <b>Her vengeful god</b><br> <b>And me, her imprisoned dragon</b><br> <br> As tensions mount at Blackwood, it’s more obvious than ever we have to do everything we can to keep her safe. But the wheels of fate are turning and I’m not sure there’s anything we can do to stop what’s already been set into motion.</p> <p>Not without having to become the very thing I most feared.</p> <p>The Ripper’s come to Blackwood in search of new victims, but if he dares to lay a finger on my mate, he’ll find out what happens to those stupid enough to touch a dragon’s most valued treasure.<br> <br> <b>For fans of Supernatural and American Horror Story, USA Today bestselling authors Meg Anne and K. Loraine are thrilled to bring you another installment in the Mate Games Universe. </b><br> <br> Warning: The Mate Games: Death is a spicy paranormal series with a cast of antiheroes utterly devoted to their heroine (even if they haven’t realized it yet). It contains a cursed Novasgardian berserker with primal energy, a dastardly pirate captain who deals in pixie dust, a possessive fae dragon shifter who is fond of hand necklaces, and a mysterious Southern gentleman who’d show her what he liked if only he could remember.</p>";
