window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Boraleashe Cavalerie was the opposite of his titan brothers. He was stoic, disagreeable, and his attitude towards others was just as biting as his frost. <i>All</i> titans were required to gift their pure hearts to another—to fall in love—as praise to the divinities for their dominion over an element. Refusal to pledge their heart was considered an act of defiance to the gods. There would be judgment . . . and atonement.</p> <p>For more than a millennium Boraleashe chose to shelter his winter heart. Fate intervened and gave Boraleashe the opportunity of earning a heart from a far more worthy love than he deserved. The newly appointed king of the Autumn World, Theodor Cavalerie, was the Bringer of Harvest and Treasure of the Realms. Why would a young virile lord like Theodor choose a surly old titan like him? Boraleashe had no logical answer—he refused the handsome king for reasons no one would understand. Boraleashe confessed to his viceroy, <i>\"Adresin, if for any reason my heart were to ever get broken, I will suffer a misery and death far more excruciating than the Snow Moon's curse on my heart.\"</i> The universe had spoken for its final time, he either choose love . . . or loss. And there was only <i>one</i> man capable of penetrating Boraleashe's icy interior. Only one warrior strong enough to save his soul from damnation.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
