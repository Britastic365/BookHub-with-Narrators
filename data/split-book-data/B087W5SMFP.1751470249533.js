window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Rayzor of Twelve, a lonely Bounty Hunter banished from his home world, is determined to follow his mission parameters: He must extract his target from a primitive planet called Earth with zero human casualties. </p> <p>His plan unfolds with precision, until a human female gets in the way. </p> <p>Rebecca doesn’t understand what the hell is happening. One moment she’s scared and alone in the spooky forest. Then a seven foot tall alien warrior is gazing at her with dark passion, his clawed hands touching her reverently. He’s kissing her, claiming her, and saying, his voice hoarse with emotion — that she is his bride. </p> <p>His bride? Wtf? </p> <p>This stranger is swoon-worthy, but…she doesn’t know his name, or what species he is and he’s kidnapped her, thrown her on his goddamn spaceship and now she’s speeding away from Earth to parts unknown. And he expects her to fall into his arms? </p> <p>Oh hell no. </p>";
