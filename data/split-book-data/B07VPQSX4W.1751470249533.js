window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Shadowvale isn’t your typical small town America. The sun never shines, the gates decide who enters, magic abounds, and every resident bears some kind of curse. </p> <p>Werewolf Virginia \"Ginny\" French's curse means no one can remember her. Not even for as long as it takes to ring up her groceries or make her favorite iced coffee. And being that forgettable has turned her life into an incredibly lonely existence. So much so, she's thinking about doing something really wild just to entertain herself. </p> <p>Werewolf Ezekiel \"Easy\" Grayle loved his life until he got struck by lightning and lost control of his shifting abilities. It’s led to some uncomfortable situations - and the decision to move to a town where the unpredictable is acceptable. </p> <p>He didn’t realize just how acceptable until he catches his hot but maybe-crazy neighbor sneaking out of his pool in a barely-there bikini. He’s too busy unpacking to pursue her, but when she comes knocking, all bets are off. </p> <p>Can a forgettable woman ever find love or is her curse too much for even the most determined man to overcome?</p>";
