Deanna Chase has worked magic, and I can’t get enough of Jade Calhoun and her adventures on Bourbon Street\" (Viv Arend, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author) </p> <p>Jade loves her new apartment - until a ghost joins her in the shower.</p> <p>When empath Jade Calhoun moves into an apartment above a strip bar on Bourbon Street, she expects life to get interesting. What she doesn’t count on is making friends with an exotic dancer, attracting a powerful spirit, and developing feelings for Kane, her sexy landlord.</p> <p>Being an empath has never been easy on Jade’s relationships. It’s no wonder she keeps her gift a secret. But when the ghost moves from spooking Jade to terrorizing Pyper, the dancer, it’s up to Jade to use her unique ability to save her. Except she’ll need Kane’s help - and he’s betrayed her with a secret of his own - to do it. Can she find a way to trust him and herself before Pyper is lost?</p>";
