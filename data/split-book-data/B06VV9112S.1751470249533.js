And not just that; my true identity must remain the gravest of secrets. No one can find out I'm the Tatuma of Osolis - the princess of their enemy world - especially now I know why I've been veiled my entire life. </p> <p>I have to believe I can do it, because only then can I continue the search for Prince Kedrick's murderer and navigate my way back to King Jovan's castle. </p> <p>Has my mother refused Jovan's peace offers and declared war? Do my brothers and Aquin know I'm alive? Who are my enemies, and who are my friends? </p> <p>Nothing is certain. Though...if I think about it, nothing has been certain in a long time. </p> <p><b>Warning:</b> Cliff-hanger ending.
