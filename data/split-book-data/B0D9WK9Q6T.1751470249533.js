However, new dangers and unexpected enemies await at every turn, forcing them to face their greatest challenges yet. The calamities inside the barrier slowly manifest in the outside world as well, pulling citizens from both sides of the battle into the fray. In this new war, they may not all make it out alive.<br> <br> Elm and Ava must confront the growing darkness and create a future in a world that has been all but stripped of hope.
