window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>It was the perfect vacation fling. And then a body showed up.</b></p> <p>Jane Austen fan Amelia Bennett sneaks away from a dull tour of an English country manor, only to run into a man more dashing than Mr. Darcy himself. About to lose his ancestral home to family debts, charming aristocrat Tom Calder invites his American guest to join him in drinking his way through the estate’s priceless wine collection. But when they wake in his bed the next morning, they’re convinced that in their drunken haze they witnessed a murder.</p> <p>Problem is, the body has vanished and no one believes them—except the shadowy figures stalking them through the estate's empty halls and lonely woodlands. On the run for their lives, Amelia and Tom must piece together their shifting memories and a string of baffling clues to expose the crime—while navigating their morning-after awkwardness and the undeniable sparks between them. As their unexpected bond deepens, they begin to wonder if their own love story could be one for the ages—if they manage to survive at all.</p>";
