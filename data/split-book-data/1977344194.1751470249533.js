Her shop is still under construction, she's sort-of fired from her job, and her hottest date this week is with a microwave burrito. However, when Dane Clark finds himself at the center of a murder investigation, Lola slips on her gorgeous vintage sunglasses and takes the case. </p> <p>She's determined to prove that her sometimes-boss, sometimes-boyfriend is innocent, even if that means dealing with Dane's \"charming\" parents and planning a \"splendid\" charity gala in under two weeks. However, it doesn't take psychic powers for Lola to see that the closer she gets to uncovering the murderer, the more danger she's in - and this killer isn't afraid to strike again. </p> <p>With Lola struggling to piece together love, career, and a murder investigation, she wonders if her relationship with Dane Clark is destined for failure or if maybe, it's been written in the stars all along....</p>";
