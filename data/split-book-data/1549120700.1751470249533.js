A deadly game of cat-and-mouse has them fighting to stay one step ahead of the brilliant serial killer - or see their fateful romance cut short by unspeakable tragedy.</b></p> <p>Audrey Rose Wadsworth and Thomas Cresswell have landed in America, a bold, brash land unlike the genteel streets of London.

Identifying him is one thing, but capturing him - and getting dangerously lost in the infamous Murder Hotel he constructed as a terrifying torture device - is another.</p> <p>Will Audrey Rose and Thomas see their last mystery to the end - together and in love - or will their fortunes finally run out when their most depraved adversary makes one final, devastating kill?</p>";
