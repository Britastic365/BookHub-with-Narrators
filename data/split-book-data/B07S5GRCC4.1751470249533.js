window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Tooth.</b> Vice President of the Coffin Nails Motorcycle Club. On a never-ending quest for vengeance. The last thing he needs is becoming a permanent babysitter for a male hooker.<br> <b>Lucifer.</b> Fallen. Lost. Alone.</p> <p>After a childhood filled with neglect and abuse, followed by his mother’s suicide, Lucifer set out into the world alone. There was nothing for him out there other than taking it one day at a time. As the bastard son of the Coffin Nails club president, Lucifer never got much fatherly love. So when the Nails show up at the strip joint Lucifer works in, the last thing he expects is to be put in the custody of Tooth, the Nails Vice President famous for his gruesome interrogation techniques. The man proves to be the sexiest beast Lucifer has ever met. He’s also older, straight, and an itch Luci can’t ever scratch.</p> <p>Tooth’s life came to a halt 12 years ago. His lover got brutally murdered, police never found the perpetrators, and all leads were dead ends. To find peace and his own justice, Tooth joined the Coffin Nails, but years on, he’s gotten nowhere with the case, yet still lives on with the burning fire for revenge.</p> <p>Babysitting a deeply scarred teenager with a talent for disappearing is the last thing on his bucket list. He promised himself to never get attached to someone like him again. To make sure the openly gay boy is safe in the clubhouse, Tooth is stuck keeping an eye on him. The big, blue, attention seeking gaze is drawing Tooth in, but f***ing the president’s son is a complete no-go, even when both their feelings go beyond lust. </p> <p>What Tooth doesn’t know is that Lucifer might hold the key to the closure Tooth so desperately needs. </p> <p><b>Warning: Contains adult content: a gritty storyline, steamy scenes, explicit language, violence, and abuse.</b></p>";
