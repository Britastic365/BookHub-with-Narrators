And now that they know maintaining both connections is against the natural order of things, one of them must be sacrificed for the other two.</p> <p>Caly can't let another one of her loved ones die, but she also needs to answer the summons so she can finally meet her father. Then, perhaps, she can be sent to the Elysian Fields to be with her mother and sister. But her father has information that could change everything―and even if she's ready to sacrifice herself, she'll have to get through the Seelie Prince and the Unseelie Prince to do so, while also keeping them from killing each other.</p>";
