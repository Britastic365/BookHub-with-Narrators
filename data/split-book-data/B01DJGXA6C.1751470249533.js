window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Attraction, fear, danger - an unlikely recipe for healing scars.</p> <p>In the year since Ellie escaped The Scientist's ghastly dungeon, she still can't stop looking over her shoulder. Or stop feeling guilty over the man who sacrificed so much to save her.</p> <p>He lost everything. His career, his aspirations - even part of his body. It's no wonder he wants nothing to do with her. Too bad he's the only man she can think about.</p> <p>Lucas has vowed to stay away from Ellie, but not for the reason she thinks. The woman he craves doesn't need to waste her life taking care of a man with a missing leg, not when she needs to focus on her own healing.</p> <p>Despite the best matchmaking attempts of the Men in Blue - and their wives - the emotional and physical gap between them seems uncrossable. Until Ellie is threatened again, and the only choice is to work together until she's safe.</p> <p>But to stay in the land of the living, they'll both have to fight through their pain - and relive a few nightmares - to guarantee their demons won't destroy her future.</p> <p>Warning: Contains an alpha male with a broken body, but whose best bits are in fine working order. And a woman who survived hell and is determined to fit enough of their jagged edges together to make a whole. Vivid PTSD flashbacks of sexual violence could be disturbing for some listeners.</p>";
