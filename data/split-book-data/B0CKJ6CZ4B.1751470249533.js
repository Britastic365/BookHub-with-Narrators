And now that I know the truth—that there is no cure—he still won’t let me go. Now I’m his prisoner once again.</p> <p>He asks to feed from me several times, but I refuse all his advances. If he wants my blood, he’ll have to force it from me. He comes to my bedchambers to speak with me, but I pretend he doesn’t exist. Once his hunger intensifies and the weakness sets in, he’s forced to feed—and it won’t be from me.</p> <p>Viper escorts me from my chambers to the brothel where his prey awaits, and I’m forced to look at a gorgeous naked woman waiting for him. His betrayal has iced my heart and closed off my feelings, but my jealousy can’t be controlled. I may be angry with him, but I don’t want him to have anyone else but me.</p> <p>So I submit to the vampire king—again.</p>";
