window.bookSummaryJSON = "Twenty-four-year-old barista Belle Jamison dreams of a better job and a decent love life - until a crazy scientist spikes her mocha latte! Suddenly, Belle can wield the four elements - earth, wind, fire, and water - with only a thought. Coffee too hot? No problem. Hair in need of a blow-dry? Done. <p>Gorgeous government agent Rome Masters has been sent to neutralize Belle. But he's not the only one after her. Together they must outrun the rogue agents on their trail and find a way to control her powers. There's just one problem: the sparks Belle and Rome generate are even hotter than the ones flying from her eyes. And with her future on the line, now is the worst possible time to fall in love!</p>";
