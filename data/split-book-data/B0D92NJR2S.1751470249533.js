He allows no one to touch me, tries to protect me, yet threatens me at every turn.</p> <p>As secrets are weaved beyond our hidden realm, a fierce battle unfolds within me. As I get closer to the rebels and their cause, my loyalty to my kingdom clashes with my undeniable devotion to Dacre and the burning connection between us.</p> <p>In a world where love and hate are two edges of the same blade, I find myself caught in a delicate dance between forbidden desire and my looming destiny.</p> <p><i>Narrated in duet style.</i></p>";
