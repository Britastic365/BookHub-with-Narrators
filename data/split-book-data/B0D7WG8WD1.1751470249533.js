window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The viral TikTok stalker dark romance, burning with high heat, hilarious banter, and a love story like you’ve never seen before. Can you handle the ride?</b></p> <p><b><i>I want someone with a soul as black as night. Someone who would burn the world down for me and not lose a single minute of sleep over it.</i></b></p> <p>Trauma nurse Aly Cappellucci doesn’t need any more kinks. She likes the one she’s landed on just fine. To her, nothing could top the masked men she follows online. Unless one of those men was shirtless, heavily tattooed, and <i>waiting for her in her bedroom</i>. She dreams about being hunted by one in particular, of him chasing her down and doing deliciously dark things to her willing body. She never could have guessed that by sending one drunken text, those dreams would become her new reality.</p> <p><b><i>I want things most people don’t, craving darkness and depravity instead of light and love.</i></b></p> <p>Josh Hammond has spent his life avoiding the limelight, but his online persona is another story. At night, he posts masked thirst traps for his millions of fans to drool over, but one follower has caught his eye: Aly. After reading a comment begging him to break into her house wearing a mask, he decides to take her up on her offer.</p> <p>Together, Aly and Josh live out their darkest fantasies, unaware that Aly has captured the attention of someone else. Someone with far more sinister intentions than a little light stalking. As Josh turns from predator to protector and the stakes heighten, he must ask himself how far he’s willing to go for the woman he’s obsessed with.</p> <p><b>Lights Out</b> <b><i>is a fast-paced dark romance with a morally gray male lead. Some themes and scenes may be disturbing to listeners. Please check the TWs at the beginning of the book.</i></b></p>";
