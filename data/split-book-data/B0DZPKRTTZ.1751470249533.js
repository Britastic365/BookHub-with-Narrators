window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>An all-new and addictive dark, why-choose, captive romance from the USA Today &amp; Wall Street Journal bestselling author, Tracy Lorraine.</p> <p>You know what they say about things that are too good to be true…We might have been in a safe house recovering, but we were in danger, and still the four of us found a way to be together.</p> <p>We’d even managed to find something that I never thought possible.</p> <p>Peace.</p> <p>We were finally a team, fighting against our enemies.</p> <p>But those enemies were closer than we anticipated.</p> <p>I might have escaped, but the three men who owned equal parts of my heart were still inside the building I watched go up in flames, the house where we found each other again crumbling to ash.</p> <p>Someone betrayed us.</p> <p>Someone we trusted.</p> <p>With shattered promises, I'm forced to put my faith in someone I shouldn't.</p> <p>I walk away from the house that holds so many heart aching memories… from the men whochanged my life in more ways than they ever could imagine.</p> <p>Maverick promised me that he’d protect me from ever hurting again.</p> <p>JD promised to stand by me no matter how dark life got.</p> <p>And Reid, he promised to burn the entire world down for me.</p> <p>But how can I carry on our fight without any of them by my side?</p> <p>Dear Listener,</p> <p>Fearless is book four of four in the Harrow Creek Hawks series. It is a dark why-choose romance, meaning our leading lady has several love interests and never has to choose to find her HEA. These three a-hole alphas are certainly no heroes; their morals are questionable at best. If you're looking for a good guy, then you're in the wrong place. Enter at your own discretion.</p>";
