When ravenous, human-eating bugs descend from the skies, I think my dream is doomed—until a musclebound Xarc’n hunter rescues me from certain death. Tarv’k is strong and brave, and the purring in his chest turns my knees to jelly. </p> <p>Too bad he’s pretending not to be interested. I might be small and soft-spoken, but I’m also stubborn; I get what I want. He won’t know what hit him!</p> <p><b>TARV’K</b></p> <p>Evie is everything I ever wanted, but I don’t deserve her. She is the ray of sunshine that keeps our compound going. She deserves a younger hunter, one with fewer failures in his past. But despite my best intentions, I cannot let her go. If I cannot claim her, then I vow to be her ultimate protector.</p> <p>When Evie’s past returns to haunt her, I am determined to keep her safe. No one messes with my female! We may not have a mating bond yet, but she is still <i>mine</i>!</p> <p><b>Evie and Tarv’k’s story is a complete romance with a happily ever after, but should be listened to as part of a series.</b> </p>";
