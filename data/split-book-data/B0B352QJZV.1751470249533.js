window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>This book is part of a series about a single couple that needs to be heard in order.</b> </p> <p><b>The ugliest truths blossom into the prettiest lies. </b></p> <p>A year into the relationship with Domenico, Seth still wants him as desperately as ever. Nothing is better than being intoxicated with lust for his deadly man and feeling his steady hands all over. </p> <p>No matter the misunderstandings, the fights...the crash. The burn. </p> <p>Crossing the Mexican border has been a goal for Seth and Domenico for a few months, but the trip couldn’t have ended in more of a disaster. While Domenico is stuck at home, for Seth, each passing day becomes more difficult. Desperate to keep his family afloat, he accepts a job offer from <i>Los Sepultureros</i>. The Gravediggers. </p> <p>When Domenico’s need for control starts eroding their trust, Seth is sure their love can conquer all. But when Domenico rips open the wound left after the violence at the beginning of their relationship, it gushes blood all over their cozy lies, and this time, there may be no way to seal it. </p> <p><b>Possible spoilers.</b></p> <p><b>Themes:</b> Mafia, cartel, assassin, organized crime, trust issues, religion, love </p> <p><b>Genre:</b> Dark, twisted romance / crime thriller</p> <p><b>Warning:</b> Adult content. If you are easily offended, this book is not for you. </p> <p>Guns n’ Boys is a gritty series of extreme violence, offensive language, abuse, and morally ambiguous protagonists. Behind the morbid façade, there is a splash of inappropriate dark humor, and a love story that will crawl under your skin. </p>";
