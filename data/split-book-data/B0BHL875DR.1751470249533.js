window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From </b><b><i>USA Today</i></b><b> bestselling author Brynne Asher, a forced proximity romantic suspense about a woman on the run and a tortured soul.</b></p> <p>The princess and a dead man. They say money makes the world go round. They’d be wrong. Sure, power can be bought, but you can gain a hell of a lot more with knowledge. With knowledge comes fear. I’ve seen it. I’ve caused it. I’ve even been the brunt of it.</p> <p>But when a stowaway princess barrels into my life like a runaway train, I throw patience out the window—the same one I jump out of, taking her with me.</p> <p>Now, I’ve got more problems than any contract killer deserves. That includes Aliyah Zahir—an internationally coveted socialite, a true royal, and a social media sensation. Returning to the lion’s den, she ends up in harm’s way—all for a mirage.</p> <p>She’s chasing a ghost, but instead, she finds a dead man.</p> <p>I’m done being patient. It’s my turn to administer fear for a change, and no one is better equipped to fix Liyah’s problems than me.</p> <p>And I’m never giving her back.</p>";
