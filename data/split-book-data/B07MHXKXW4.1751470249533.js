window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Their natural affection - their very needs - draw them irrevocably closer, sealing their intimate bond for life...forbidden or not.</p> <p>Daniel has known loss and sorrow all his life, leaving him with the faintest, hard-to-reach glimmer of hope in his young mind after spending his entire childhood in the foster-care system. When he was left on the doorstep of the Andersons, his little life changed completely, unalterably. He met the warm, wide-open, mutually broken heart of the one and only Marie.</p> <p>Together, something very special, quite tender, and all together innocent was fostered between them, something that only continues to be nurtured ever so naturally, delicately, and even without either's awareness. All while the dark presence of Marie's husband, Richard, continues to loom over both of them. Richard sees what the two living under his roof cannot.</p> <p>What Daniel and Marie need most, only the other can give. Through Marie's strained and unfulfilling marriage and Daniel's angst of adolescence and fight to find his place in the world, the two are drawn all the closer together.</p> <p>It's instinctive. It's never spoken. But it's real. And every moment together, every individual and shared struggle, serves to seal their penetrating bond, a bond that will last their lifetimes.</p> <p>His coming of age and angst-ridden entry into adolescence - her steady strength and unending capacity to love - their unbreakable bond confirmed.</p>";
