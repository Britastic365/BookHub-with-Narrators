window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Three strikes and you're out? If only. </p> <p>In my world, it's more of a one-and-done situation, even if you get that one strike trying to do something good. I've been on the run for years, never staying anywhere too long, never getting attached to anything or anyone because he will always find me. </p> <p>Bane. </p> <p>He's the best bounty hunter in existence, and I'm the one that got away, well, keeps getting away. If he wasn't so sexy I would hate him for it. </p> <p>When the cat-and-mouse game turns more serious, I'm the one that ends up screwed, and not in the fun way. I won't survive in prison - not because I'm too delicate - but because my magic has always been tightly under control. Prison, though? When I'm surrounded by sexy shifters and drool-worthy vampires? That's where it will all get unleashed.</p> <p><i>Contains mature themes.</i></p>";
