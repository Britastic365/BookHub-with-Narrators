So, when they summon her to Texas years later, she packs a bag and boards the next train. She soon finds herself serving as a detective-in-training with a highly experienced but very grumpy Pinkerton agent. When the agency assigns them to work undercover as a married couple, her grumpy partner shocks her by proposing a marriage of convenience instead.<br><br>Agent Edgar Barella jumps at the chance to sink his teeth into helping track down a dangerous gang of outlaws. However, he’s furious about being saddled with another new recruit to train in the process. After what happened to his first partner, he’s convinced the only way he can protect his new one is by marrying her — at least temporarily.<br><br>His resentment about being partnered with the lovely Jolene all too quickly turns into something more. Instead of counting the days until their annulment, he uses what little time they have left together to get her to fall for him as hard as he’s fallen for her!<br><br><i>SECOND EDITION: This book was previously part of The Pinkerton Matchmaker Series.
