When she’s dazzled by the royal jewels my family crafted, she brings my world to a screeching halt. Despite her hand-me-down dress and borrowed shoes, Hollie is even more stunning than the jewelry on display and for the first time in my life, I want to impress a woman. Feisty, funny and ferociously independent, turns out she’s unimpressible.</p> <p>Then I find out Hollie’s American and about to fly back to Oregon because her boss just fired her. I’m going to use all my powers of persuasion to convince her to stay.</p> <p>She’s American. I’m British.</p> <p>She lives in a trailer. I sleep in a penthouse.</p> <p>She sells on Etsy.
