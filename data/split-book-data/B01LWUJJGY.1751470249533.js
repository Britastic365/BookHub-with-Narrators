window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After she is rescued from a cruel tyrant and brought to the planet Terranovum, Olivia soon discovers that she is to be auctioned to the highest bidder. But before she can be sold, she must be trained, and the man who will train her is none other than the commander of the king's army. </p> <p>Wes has tamed many human females, and when Olivia resists his efforts to bathe her in preparation for her initial inspection, he strips the beautiful, feisty girl bare and spanks her soundly. His stern chastisement leaves Olivia tearful and repentant yet undeniably aroused, and after the punishment she cannot resist begging for her new master's touch. </p> <p>Once she has been examined Olivia's training begins in earnest, and Wes takes her to his bed to teach her what it means to belong to a dominant man. But try as he might, he cannot bring himself to see Olivia as just another slave. She touches his heart in a way he thought nothing could, and with each passing day he grows more certain that he must claim her as his own. But with war breaking out across Terranovum, can Wes protect both his world and his woman? </p> <p>Publisher's Note: <i>A Gift for the Commander </i>is the third book of the Terranovum Brides trilogy, which began with <i>A Gift for the King</i> and continued with <i>A Gift for the Doctor</i>. It is an erotic romance novel that includes spankings and sexual scenes. If such material offends you, please don't buy this book. </p>";
