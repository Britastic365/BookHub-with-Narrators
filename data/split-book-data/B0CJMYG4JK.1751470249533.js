And Sebastian Creed is all alpha, all the time.</p> <p>Planning this fundraiser with him is going to be a challenge because he’s not willing to give in and neither am I. But our libidos don’t get the message, and soon, our butting heads turns to bumping uglies.

Then again, I might not have a choice.</p>";
