window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When the new girl in town, Eliza \"Izzy\" Forrester, decides to hit the local drinking hole, she's not ready to meet the town's good, solid guy. She's definitely not prepared to engage in her very first hookup with him. </p> <p>Then Izzy wakes up the next morning in Johnny Gamble's bed, and good girl Izzy finds she likes being bad for Johnny. </p> <p>Even so, Izzy feels Johnny holding her at arm's length. But Johnny makes it clear he wants more, and Izzy already knows she wants as much as she can get of hot-in-bed, sweet-out-of-it Johnny Gamble. </p> <p>Floating on air, thinking this is going somewhere, Izzy quickly learns why Johnny holds distant. </p> <p>He's in love with someone else. Someone who left him and did it leaving him broken. Whoever was up next would be runner-up, second best. Knowing the stakes, Izzy will take what she can get from the gentleman that's Johnny Gamble. And even knowing his heart might never mend, Johnny can't seem to stay away from Izzy. </p> <p>Until out of nowhere, his lost love comes back to town. He's not going back, but Johnny still knows the right thing to do is let Izzy go. </p> <p>And Izzy knew the stakes, so she makes it easy and slips though his fingers. </p> <p>But that's before Johnny realizes Izzy moved to town to escape danger that's been swirling around her. </p> <p>And that's why Johnny decides to wade in. </p> <p>That and the fact Izzy Forrester makes breakfast with a canary singing on her shoulder and fills out tight dresses in a way Johnny Gamble cannot get out of his head. </p>";
