window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>It took one day to strip an Archangel of everything he held dear.</b></p> <p>On the battlefield of Heaven, Uriel lost more than his left ear. He lost his Committeds and his will to live. Decades later, he’s drowning himself at the bottom of a bottle, with no escape in sight. He tried to end his misery, but death didn't take. Resigned to suffering eternity alone with only the ghosts of the ones he lost as company, the last thing Uriel wants is a new love.</p> <p><b>It took one day for a hybrid to fall in love with a broken, lost Archangel.</b></p> <p>As the hybrid spawn of Lucifer, Jesse isn’t exactly popular with angels; carrying the face of a monster tends to have that effect. So, he keeps his head down and secretly prays for the day someone can see past his golden eyes to the soul inside—the soul desperate for the solace only surrender can provide.</p> <p>A grieving Archangel searching for hope and a reason to live. A hybrid yearning for a firm, loving hand, and a place to belong. Join Uriel and Jesse as they test the boundaries of love and the infinite limits of grace.</p> <p><i>Cuffs &amp; Carnations is a spin-off story within the Fire &amp; Brimstone universe. It can be read as a standalone but is best enjoyed after reading the completed Fire &amp; Brimstone Scrolls series. Trigger warnings include: non-graphic mentions of attempted suicide/suicidal thoughts, cavalier commentary/dark jokes about suicide, self-destructive abuse of alcohol and the resulting withdrawal symptoms, and elements of BDSM and kink, including bondage, impact play, power exchange, and light breath play.</i></p>";
