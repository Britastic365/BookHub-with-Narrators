window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Monsters, magic, and mates I never knew existed.</p> <p>Kia versus power pole isn't the end I expect - it's the beginning of...where do I begin? Four wildly sexy males. Powers I don't understand. And the eyes of the fae world on me as the person to unite the severed realms. No pressure.</p> <p>This is book one in a steamy paranormal shifter romance series where the female main character doesn't have to choose. Expect polyamorous situations, rollicking action, ongoing storylines, and shifter lovers who find what they need from not only their queen but each other as well. Medium-burn, medium angst.</p>";
