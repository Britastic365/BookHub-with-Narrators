window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Allies are turning into enemies.</b><br> <b>I have enough enemies already, thanks.</b></p> <p>So...yesterday was hell. Literally. Now, I find myself asking how a day could be that terrible while also being the most amazing day of my life.</p> <p>When I fled my safe haven in the demon realm to deliver news of betrayal and conspiracy to Rans, I thought it meant I was losing everything. Again. Instead, I've just gained the most valuable gift I could ever receive.</p> <p>I’m hopelessly in love with the last vampire on Earth. That’s hardly a news flash at this point. But I never expected my feelings to be returned...and I’ve never been happier to be wrong. Now, he’s mine, and I am his. Our lives are bound inextricably, even unto death.</p> <p>Of course, at this rate it just might come to that. The demon we thought was our most powerful ally has been using Rans for his own ends. And he’s been doing so for centuries.</p> <p>Until now, I thought Rans and I were on one side of a war between the demons and the Fae. Turns out we’re standing squarely in the middle of the battlefield, and both armies are shooting at us. When both sides are in the wrong, who do you stand with?</p> <p>Maybe the answer is obvious. I stand with Rans, and he stands with me.</p> <p><b>The last vampire, and the first demon-Fae-human hybrid.</b><br> <b>Together against the world.</b></p> <p><i>The Last Vampire</i> is a steamy urban fantasy romance series from <i>USA Today</i> best seller R. A. Steffan and Jaelynn Woolf, coauthors of the Circle of Blood saga.</p> <p>Grab the omnibus of books four through six today, and enter a world shared by humans, fae, demons, and one very reluctant vampire. It’s a place where the supernatural threatens the mundane, nothing is as it seems, and love will either be the world’s downfall - or its salvation.</p>";
