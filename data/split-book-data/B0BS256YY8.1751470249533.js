window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A brave starship crew are drawn into the schemes of interplanetary powers competing for galactic domination, in this epic space opera from the best-selling strategic boardgame, Twilight Imperium.</p> <p>Captain Felix Duval and the crew of the Temerarious quietly patrol a remote Mentak Coalition colony system where nothing ever happens. But when they answer a distress call from a moon under attack, that peaceful existence is torn apart. They rescue a scientist, Thales, who's developing revolutionary technology to create new wormholes. He just needs a few things to make it fully operational...and now, ordered to aid the scientist, the Temerarious is targeted by two rival black-ops teams intent on reacquiring Thales. Can Felix trust Thales? Or is this a conspiracy to tip the balance of power in the galaxy forever?</p> <p>Performed by Ken Jackson, Ryan Haugen, Alyssa Keegan, Lise Bruneau, David Jourdan, Julie-Ann Elliot, Steven Carpenter, Bradley Foster Smith, Colleen Delany, Holly Adams, James Konicek, J.
