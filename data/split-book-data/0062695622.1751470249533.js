He’s made one too many enemies in his two centuries of existence, including Dagon, a demon who now lays claim to his soul. Ian’s only chance to escape Dagon is to join forces with a Law Guardian, but he's never been able to abide by the rules for long.</p> <p>The lawmaker...</p> <p>Veritas’ normal role is police, judge, and jury to reprobates like Ian. But she has her own ax to grind with Dagon, so if she can use Ian as bait...well, all’s fair in law and war. As they scour supernatural hot spots to perfect their trap, Veritas soon realizes Ian’s carefully cultivated devil-may-care roguish image hides something much more powerful. And Ian discovers Veritas has shocking secrets of her own. </p> <p>As they’re drawn to each other with a passion as intense as their peril, either love or justice will prevail. But each will have devastating consequences.</p>";
