One named Abaddon who was currently tearing Hell apart trying to find me.</p> <p>Which meant I now had a choice to make. Let the Beast destroy all the realms or find myself a date.</p> <p>Because now the fate of the world rested upon my shoulders. They relied on me to find the one mortal vessel strong enough to contain the Beast by merging their souls as one.</p> <p>There was just one problem with this. I had made a Beast fall in love with me.
