window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A girls' night out means three things to me: drinking whiskey with my best friend, trying not to kill anyone, and keeping my magic hidden. A fae gladiator like me isn’t supposed to exist anymore.</p> <p>But my Friday night takes a bad turn when a lethally gorgeous fae - Ruadan - tries to assassinate me. He's known as the Wraith, and he's taken a vow of silence until he’s slaughtered the outlaws on his kill list. Outlaws like me.</p> <p>Ruadan lets me live on one condition: I have to earn my place at the Institute of the Shadow Fae. As a powerful fighter, I can take the competition.</p> <p>But things fall apart when I’m given an impossible choice: Betray my mentor Ruadan or my best friend dies. Now, I face a quandary my gladiatorial past did not prepare me for.</p> <p><b>This book is from the Demons of Fire and Night world.</b></p>";
