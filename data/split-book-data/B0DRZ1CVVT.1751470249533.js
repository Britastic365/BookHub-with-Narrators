He's as forbidden to me as I am to him.</p> <p>When I land a new gig as the team photographer, we vow to keep it professional. We mostly succeed…except for that time after a game when he couldn’t keep his talented hands off me. But I swear, it won’t happen again.</p> <p>Too much is at stake—I can’t risk my heart or my father’s team.</p> <p>But when I end up living at Miles’s place to care for his pack of rescue pups, the lines blur fast.</p> <p>Late nights turn into stolen moments and I discover there’s more to him than I ever imagined—a man who’s genuine, thoughtful, and irresistibly real.</p> <p>He looks at me like he can’t believe his luck. Touches me like he never wants to let go. And listens to my hopes and fears.</p> <p>My heart’s getting dangerously attached. But if I follow it… am I putting everyone’s dreams on the line?</p>";
