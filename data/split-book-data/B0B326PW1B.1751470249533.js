I don’t do commitment—been there, done that, got the broken heart—and sweet-as-pie Becca is too close to girlfriend material. </p> <p>But she asks me to help her find her naughty side, and I’m the perfect guy for the job. She wants to take some risks and face her fears, and I have all kinds of ideas. I just need to keep my d*ck—and my heart—out of it. </p> <p>After all, we’re just two friends having fun. What could possibly go wrong? </p> <p>Suddenly single, and on my own in a new town, I decide it’s time to stop being so predictable. I’m tired of being the good girl. And who better to help me out of my shell than my new neighbor, Lucas? </p> <p>Sure, he’s sexy as sin. And as our adventures in naughtiness escalate, my lady parts are not complaining. </p> <p>We agreed to stay just friends. We wouldn’t let this get complicated. But Lucas is kind of amazing. And the more time we spend together, the more my heart wants things he can’t give. </p> <p><b><i>Good Girl Next Door</i></b><b> was previously titled </b><b><i>Could Be the One</i></b><b>.</b></p>";
