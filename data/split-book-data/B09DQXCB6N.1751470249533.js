window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It's amazing to be a dominant wolf...if you're male.</p> <p>When you're a 19-year-old girl who can beat the crap out of every wolf in your pack, suddenly it's not so great. Love isn't everything, I know; but even the most powerful she-wolf submits to her mate. If you can't be dominated, you can't be mated. And an unmated wolf has no place in the pack.</p> <p>My one hope is the clan gathering in the Blackwood Fortress. Every wolf in the continent attends, and a few seriously sexy wolves catch my eye. I'm bound to find at least one who can match me, right?</p> <p>Then there's my other problem: My alpha is a grade-A jerk. After treating me like a genetic freak my whole life, he suddenly decides to stake a claim.</p> <p>But I can't refuse the challenge, and my wolf won't back down. Either I submit to the alpha and become mated to his skeezy pelt, or I win the challenge and my freedom...by taking his place as alpha.</p> <p>Only no one has ever heard of a female alpha, and if I become one, I'll never find a mate.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
