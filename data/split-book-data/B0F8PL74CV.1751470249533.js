window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>After being in a relationship for three years, Noelle Frost is faced with the reality that she was definitely the better half.</b></p> <p>Her friends, ecstatic she's dropped the dead weight of a cheating boyfriend, urge her to get away for the holiday and take some time for herself. Not sure if that'll fix anything, but willing to try, she books a last-minute trip to the world-renowned Mistletoe Mountain Resort. Noelle boards the plane with the promise of peace and relaxation on the horizon.</p> <p>Snow King is stuck in a rut, believing himself undeserving of joy and pleasure after suffering more than one devastating lossâ€”one he still shoulders the blame for. Even with supportive family and friends, he still prefers solitude.</p> <p>Every year, instead of trudging through the painful memories Christmas brings, he takes a solo trip to escape the holiday cheer. Typically, that's anywhere that doesn't remind him of the season. But this year, his well-meaning assistant books him a trip to the North Pole reincarnate.</p> <p>An overbooking incident, one disrobed guest, and a nasty run-in with pepper spray tell the Christmas story in a way you won't believe.</p> <p><i>Contains mature content.
