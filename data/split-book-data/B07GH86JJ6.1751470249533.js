window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Welcome to Nocturne Falls, the town that celebrates Halloween 365 days a year. The tourists think it's all a show: the vampires, the werewolves, the witches, the occasional gargoyle flying through the sky. But the supernaturals populating the town know better. </p> <p>Living in Nocturne Falls means being yourself. Fangs, fur, and all.</p> <p>Private investigator Wyatt West finds his job a little tedious most days, but that changes when he meets a bewitching blonde florist who needs a favor in the way of a wedding date. There's definitely something magical about her, but little does he know just how correct that first impression is.</p> <p>Single mom Marigold Williams finds herself instantly attracted to Wyatt but doesn't dare tell this handsome human that she's a witch and things in Nocturne Falls are a little spookier than he suspects. He’s just a nice guy who’s offered to be her plus one. She doesn’t need to turn his world upside down with the truth over one date.</p> <p>Despite that agreement, their feelings deepen, and both agree to try a relationship beyond their current temporary arrangement. Now Marigold must tell him about her witchy side. After all, he has a right to know whom he’s dating.</p> <p>But when Wyatt unwittingly frees some dangerous magic, Marigold knows a life-changing sacrifice is the only way to set things right. Will her magic save him? And will he be able to handle the truth that comes with it?</p>";
