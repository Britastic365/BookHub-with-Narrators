window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After narrowly surviving my debut into the magical world, I made a promise to myself: no more hiding in broom closets. But with the Mages' Guild reorganizing faster than anyone thought possible, and naming me as their number one target, that promise seems a little far-fetched. Especially since my training with Callie and Dizzy, the highly experienced dual-mage pair, goes off like a cake in a cannon. Left to find someone that can fill the role, it isn't until a formal dinner party goes horribly wrong that I find the best (and worst) solution imaginable: Reagan Somerset, the leather-clad crazy woman who busted into my broom closet sanctuary in the first place. Through an off-kilter teaching style and many punches in the face, I learn my true potential. But with her happier busting heads and kicking in doors than staying put with a pupil in hiding, it isn't long before the world comes crashing down. The Guild has found me, and they intend to take me alive.</p>";
