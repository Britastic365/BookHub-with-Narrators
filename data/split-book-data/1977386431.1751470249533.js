window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Love, in English</i> is a contemporary romance about the ultimate forbidden love story, from the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of <i>The Pact </i>and <i>Before I Ever Met You</i>. </p> <p>To a restless dreamer like Vera Miles, it sounded like the experience of a lifetime. Instead of spending her summer interning for her astronomy major, she would fly to Spain where she'd spend a few weeks teaching conversational English to businessmen and women, all while enjoying free room and board at an isolated resort. But while Vera expected to get a tan, meet new people and stuff herself with wine and paella, she never expected to fall in love. </p> <p>Mateo Casalles is unlike anyone Vera has ever known, let alone anyone she's usually attracted to. While Vera is a pierced and tatted free spirit with a love for music and freedom, Mateo is a successful businessman from Madrid, all sharp suits and cocky Spanish charm. Yet, as the weeks go on, the two grow increasingly close and their relationship changes from purely platonic to something...more. Something that makes Vera feel alive for the first time. Something that can never, ever be. Or so she thinks. </p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
