window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>We shared the love of a lifetime. Too bad I don't remember any of it.</p> <p>Pieces of my life were ripped away without warning. My career, my control, my sense of self...it's gone. So are my memories of him. I now know him as the handsome doctor who was there for me when I first woke up after the accident. But before that, he was the love of my life. My everything. Or so I'm told.</p> <p>I'm not the woman he remembers. I'm just a ghost with her face. An unfortunate remnant of the happily ever after, fairy tale kind of romance we apparently had together.</p> <p>He says he'll wait for me. That he won't stop fighting for us, even if he has to make me fall in love with him all over again.</p> <p>I think he's right. I will fall for him. But the real question is, can he truly ever love me for who I am now? Or will his heart always belong to the memory of who I used to be? </p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
