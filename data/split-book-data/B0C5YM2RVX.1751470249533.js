Instead, my world has been turned upside down, and my bright future at Black Veil University is suddenly looking dim.<br> <br> The shadows are closing in, putting those I love most at risk, and they will stop at nothing to get what they want.<br> <br> <i>Knight Revelations</i> is book 2 of 5 in the Black Veil University Series which<i> DOES </i>end in a cliffhanger.
