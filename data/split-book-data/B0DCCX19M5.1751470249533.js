window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>She’s back in town. He needs a nanny. It should be simple. But in the small town of Misty Peak, simple is never easy.</b></p> <p>Sadie Sandler wouldn’t consider herself a quitter. But then, she did walk out on her own wedding twenty-three minutes before she was supposed to walk down the aisle. Now she’s back in the small town of Misty Peak, working at her grandmother’s bakery and nannying the child she basically raised. There’s just one problem…the child’s father. He’s tall, sexy and has the kind of ocean-blue eyes she could drown in. There are so many reasons why she should stay away from Eastern. So why doesn’t she want to heed a single one?</p> <p>Eastern Walker has one focus—his eight-year-old daughter, Avery. She’s suffered too much for someone so young. She needs stability, and he’s determined to be the best father possible—so why can’t he get his mind off the new nanny? The young woman with the beautiful black eyes, who treats his daughter as if she were her own? He’s the town sheriff, and before that, a Navy SEAL; if there’s anything he’s good at, it’s staying focused. But Sadie’s proving to be his greatest distraction.</p> <p>Soon, resisting each other turns out to be the least of Eastern and Sadie’s concerns. People from both their pasts reappear, and they’ll go to great lengths to keep the couple apart. And they’re not even the biggest threats in Misty Peak…or to Sadie and Eastern’s happy ending. </p> <p><i>A Small Town, Age Gap, Single Dad, Nanny, Romantic Suspense from Bestselling author Nyssa Kathryn.</i></p>";
