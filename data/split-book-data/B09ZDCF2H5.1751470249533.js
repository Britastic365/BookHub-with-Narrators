window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>My Alpha captured me…and now I can’t remember why I ran from him in the first place.</p> <p>Literally.</p> <p>My memory has been fractured and tossed into the Web. My mission is to reclaim who I used to be.</p> <p>My Alpha? He has other plans.</p> <p>It’s a race to gather the lost fragments of my soul tossed into the fabric of space and time. He broke me. Now he wants to put me back together how he sees fit. All the while forcing me to take horrendous obedience classes at Fortune Fae Academy like I’m some sort of pet to be trained.</p> <p>Axel might be my only hope—the lesser of two evils. With his help, my Betas and I might just be able to get out of this mess. There will be a price to pay, but anything is better than being enslaved to my Alpha forever.</p> <p>Even if he does awaken something in me that says this feels right...and my body tends to agree whenever he’s around.</p> <p>I have to stay strong and remember I ran from him for a reason. Darkness torments my dreams every night and I know something bad is coming. If I don’t figure out a way to run from it in time, I can kiss the shards of my soul goodbye—for good.</p> <p><i>Fortune Fae Academy: Book Two </i>is a reverse harem omegaverse romance. Be warned there are obsessive males who will stop at nothing to claim their fated mate. Trigger warnings include dub-con, strong language, and violence. As this is a series, book two ends on a cliff-hanger.</p>";
