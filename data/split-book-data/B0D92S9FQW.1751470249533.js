window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A sinister illusionist wants Alice... and he won't take no for an answer. As eager as Alice was to start her new job, she got far more than she bargained for when entering employment at Strande Estate. Inexplicable noises. Haunting legends. A sexy-as-they-come amateur magician. And an enticingly wicked ghost. Alice didn't believe in anything paranormal when she arrived, but each day that passes leaves her questioning things she never thought she would like whether or not her gorgeous boss was as magically gifted in the bedroom as he was at illusions. But deep within the walls of the Strande manor, a malevolent spirit has taken a keen interest in the new caretaker. Thrilled to have a new plaything at his disposal, he has devilish games planned for the unsuspecting Alice. Will she make it out of the Strande Estate alive? Or be lured into the seductive darkness? Audiobook Narration by Matthew Thomasin. Written by Kathryn Ann Kingsley. \"House of Ghosts\" Music by Andy Slatter Music</p>";
