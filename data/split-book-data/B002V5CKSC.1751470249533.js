window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Forensic sculptor Eve Duncan puts a face on the victims of violent crimes. She’s working on the skull of a newly discovered Jane Doe, her face destroyed beyond recognition. But whoever killed this poor girl wasn’t trying to hide her identity. The plan is far more horrifying. As the face begins to appear under Eve’s skilled hands, she gets the shock of her life: The victim is someone she knows all too well. Someone who isn’t dead. Yet. </p> <p>To stop a twisted psychopath, Eve must put her own life on the line. But that’s not the worst of it—when her adopted daughter, Jane, reveals a bizarre connection to the case, Eve can’t stop her from joining the hunt for the killer . . . a chase that will lead to a harrowing confrontation.</p>";
