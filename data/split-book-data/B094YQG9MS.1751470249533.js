Little does she know, Delaney O’Connor, the company’s CEO, is bringing his only grandson and the hero of Zoey’s childhood, Ben Pierce, home from Europe to run the network. </p> <p>Ben’s one true passion was Grand Prix racing - until he laid eyes on Zoey again, all grown up and more beautiful than ever. But he also must face his haunted past and the near-fatal accident that brought his driving career to a screeching halt. Confronting painful emotions he crossed an ocean to forget, Ben must barter his old dreams for new ones if he and Zoey are to claim the wonderful future they are meant to share.</p>";
