What she got was a dead shop owner and a sexy ghost who’s suddenly everywhere—at her shop, in her car, and even lounging in her bedroom. But he’s not just any ghost. He’s a witch and able to appear in solid form...sometimes. If only he’d stop disappearing on her.</p> <p>And Pyper needs his help. When she becomes target numero uno and the prime suspect in the shop owner’s death, it appears her ghost holds the key to solving the murder. In between stolen kisses, Pyper will need to get to the bottom of all of his secrets if she wants to stay alive and out of jail...and maybe finally get that date he keeps promising her.</p> <p><i>Spirits, Rock Stars, and a Midnight Chocolate Bar</i><br> It’s date night! And medium Pyper Rayne is finally getting some alone time with her oh-so-sexy new boyfriend, Julius. But when a representative from the Witches’ Council shows up during appetizers, the romance portion of the evening comes to a screeching halt. Julius is needed to deal with paranormal activity—on a cruise ship to the Caribbean.</p> <p>An all-expense paid cruise to the Caribbean sounds like the perfect second date...until Pyper witnesses the death of a famous rock star.

Only not everyone is who they seem. They’ll need to untangle the web of secrets and figure out who to trust before they risk everything...including their own lives.</p> <p><i>Spirits, Diamonds, and a Drive-thru Daiquiri Stand</i><br> Pyper and Julius are getting married. There’s a wedding to plan, dresses to order, and daiquiris to consume. But when an old curse rears its ugly head and ends in a murder, Pyper’s younger brother Bo is suddenly in danger of being charged with a crime he didn’t commit.</p> <p>Now Pyper and her friends are racing against time to clear Bo’s name and neutralize the curse before it claims another life. With a little help from the ghosts of New Orleans, Pyper’s determined to save the day...and still find her perfect wedding dress.</p> <p><i>Spirits, Spells, and Wedding Bells</i></p> <p>It’s three weeks until Pyper Rayne and her fiancé Julius tie the knot. All she wants to do is enjoy her risqué bridal shower, complete the final details of her wedding, and find time to enjoy the holidays. But when Charlie, the manager of Wicked, is arrested for a murder she didn’t commit, Pyper puts her medium skills to the test in order to find the real killer before Charlie takes the fall.
