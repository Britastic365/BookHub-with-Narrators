window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>As a Rock Chick, Shirleen Jackson lived through all the kidnappings and explosions. Along the way, she also watched the dramatic love stories that came with those rides unfold. </p> <p>But long ago, Shirleen made her choice. It affected who she was and would always be. She decided to settle for what she had and not want more. She had good friends. She was raising two fine young men who weren't hers, but she loved them anyway. She was good. </p> <p>And then Moses Richardson crashed into her life, literally...and deliberately. Moses has different ideas about Shirleen. He's more interested in the Shirleen of now, mostly because she's interesting. And funny. And loyal. Smart. Beautiful. </p> <p>But Moses has a big challenge on his hands. </p> <p>He has to convince Shirleen of all that. </p> <p>And then convince her she deserves to have more. </p>";
