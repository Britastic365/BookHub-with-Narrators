window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An assassin at a renaissance faire. What could possibly go wrong? Everything, if you’re the Spider....</b></p> <p>I might be Gin Blanco, a.k.a. the assassin the Spider, but even I need a break from the bad guys every now and then. So when Owen Grayson, my significant other, suggests a trip to the Winter’s Web Renaissance Faire, it sounds like a perfect distraction from all my problems.</p> <p>The faire starts off innocently enough, but something seems slightly off about the cheery atmosphere and costumed characters. Maybe I’m being paranoid, but I can’t help but feel like I’m trapped in someone else’s icy web - and that they don’t want me to leave the faire alive....</p> <p>Note: <i>Winter’s Web</i> is a 27,000-word novella that takes place after the events of <i>Venom in the Veins</i>, book 17 in the Elemental Assassin urban fantasy series. <i>Winter’s Web</i> first appeared in the <i>Seasons of Sorcery</i> anthology in 2018.</p>";
