window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Caroline Clifford’s bland life as a London tour guide flips upside down when her beloved uncle is brutally murdered at a Bulgarian archaeological site. While traveling to recover his remains, she meets a man who corresponded with her uncle. Jude Barrett is a biochemist on a mission: to rid the world of vampires…. </p> <p>At first, Caro is dismissive of Jude’s beliefs, but she can’t ignore the signs that are all around her: the human bite marks on her uncle, the men following her, the anguished cries after sundown. Strange anagrams on her uncle’s passport lead her and Jude to a cliff-top monastery in Greece, where a shattering revelation connects a relic Caro inherited from her parents to an age-old text on immortality - and an enigmatic prophecy that pits the forces of darkness and light in a showdown that could destroy them all.... </p>";
