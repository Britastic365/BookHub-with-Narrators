Even when she was the annoying little sister following us around. I would do anything for her. It is another family vacation, except this time it feels different. Everything feels different. </p> <p>Alex </p> <p>All my memories have Dylan in them—from the first time I fell off my bike to the time I got my heart broken for the first time. He’s always been my protector, but it’s time to let the dream of being his go. One last family trip, one last goodbye. Except fate steps in and has other plans.</p>";
