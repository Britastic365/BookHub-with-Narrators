window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Our story begins the same as any ill-fated romance. Two households, two families, two species that should never be together.</p> <p>These are the recipe for tragic, beautiful love, fated to end in flames.</p> <p>She is my doom. She is my destiny. Unavoidable, impossible to deny, and painful to ignore.</p> <p>They call me Bastard Prince, a half-breed unworthy of a true title. But I still have to follow the rules. Serve the Blackthorne vampire bloodline.</p> <p>A shifter and a vampire are forbidden to be together. The law declares it so. But Briar is mine, and Iâ€™ll fight family and constitution to the death in order to keep her.</p> <p><i>Midnight Prince</i> is the first of an all new series in the Blackthorne Vampires world. It contains a cliffhanger and can be listened to without listening to The Blood Trilogy, but it's recommended to listen to all three previous audiobooks (<i>Blood Captive</i>, <i>Blood Traitor</i>, <i>Blood Heir</i>) to avoid any minor spoilers.</p>";
