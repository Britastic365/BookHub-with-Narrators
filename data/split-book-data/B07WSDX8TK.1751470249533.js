window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>One man can change everything. That man can touch you until you tremble all over. That man can wake you up and allow you to breathe when life leaves you unable to catch your breath. For me that <i>One Man</i> is Jax North. He's handsome, brutally so, and wealthy, money and power easily at his fingertips. He's dark, and yet, he can make me smile with a single look or word. He's a force when he walks into a room. </p> <p>Our first encounter is intense, overwhelmingly intense. I go with it. I go with him, and how can I not? He's that <i>One Man</i> for me, and what a ride it is. But there are things about me that he doesn't know, he can't know, so I say goodbye. Only you don't say goodbye to a man like Jax if he doesn't want you to. I've challenged him without trying. He wants me. I don't want to want him, and yet, I crave him. He tears me down, my resistance, my walls. But those walls protect me. They seal my secrets inside. And I forget that being alone is safe. I forget that there are reasons I canâ€™t be with Jax North. I forget that once he knows, everything will change. </p> <p>Because I need him. </p> <p>Because he's my <i>One Man</i>. </p> <p><i>One Man</i> is the first book in the dangerously sexy Naked Trilogy by <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Lisa Renee Jones.</p>";
