Sweet, dark, and complex as wildflower honey.\" (Hannah Whitten, </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author of </b><b><i>For the Wolf</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b>\"A deliciously dark fairy tale filled with bone-chilling horror and breathtaking romance that will keep you turning the pages long into the night.\" (Kara Thomas, author of </b><b><i>The Cheerleaders</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>That Weekend</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b>\"As dark and romantic as it haunting, Small Favors is an eerie fairytale that I couldnâ€™t put down.\" (Alexis Henderson, author of </b><b><i>The Year of the Witching</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p>Ellerie Downing is waiting for something to happen. Life in isolated Amity Falls, surrounded by an impenetrable forest, has a predictable sameness. Her days are filled with tending to her family's beehives, chasing after her sisters, and dreaming of bigger things while her twin, Samuel, is free to roam as he wishes.</p> <p>Early town settlers fought off monstrous creatures in the woods, and whispers that the creatures still exist keep the Downings and their neighbors from venturing too far. When some townsfolk go missing on a trip to fetch supplies, a heavy unease settles over the Falls. </p> <p>Strange activities begin to plague the town, and as the seasons change, it's clear that something is terribly wrong. The creatures are real, and they're offering to fulfill the residents' deepest desires, however grand, for just a small favor. These seemingly trifling demands, however, hide sinister intentions. Soon Ellerie finds herself in a race against time to stop Amity Falls, her family, and the boy she loves from going up in flames.</p>";
