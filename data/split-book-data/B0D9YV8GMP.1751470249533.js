window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>I can't live my life in a cage anymore. Please... take me with you.</b></p> <p>My whole life is squeezed inside these walls. I can't remember the last time I left this building.</p> <p>My guardian, Ethan, tells me it's to keep me safe. During his visits, he tells me the world is dark and full of evil. The evil that killed my parents, stole my family from me, and left me in Ethan's care.</p> <p>He wants me to stay here. Forever.</p> <p>When a group of men break into my prison, I make a reckless decision. Information in exchange for freedom. Danger in exchange for safety.</p> <p>They're everything Ethan ever warned me about. Maverick, the puppet master with cool eyes and a colder smile. Ryder, the thief with light fingers and a dark heart. And Enzo, who'd rather carve himself into my skin than let me leave.</p> <p>I have to make a decision. The man who raised me... or the men who stole me?</p> <p><i>This is a why-choose, dark contemporary retelling of Rapunzel with three morally gray men and a heroine who'll do anything for freedom. For mature listeners.</i></p>";
