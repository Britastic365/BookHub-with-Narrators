window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>What begins as a kinky game ends up as something else entirely.</b><br> <br> When I start a new job as the Ink Factor tattoo parlor receptionist, I have no idea what to expect. My skin is virgin, so I've never stepped foot into a place like it. But it's not the graffitied walls or the crazy loud music that overwhelms me; it's the eight huge, sexy, tattooed men who own it.</p> <p>Dex and Lex are twins with pierced tongues, wicked grins, and snake tattoos that disappear beneath their waistbands to goodness knows where.<br> Nash, Niall, and Noah are triplets who have marked their skin to make their gorgeous jacked bodies less identical.<br> Kase and Kole are dark and mysterious, watching everything I do with a mix of suspicion and fascination.<br> And Carl is the boss. With ice blue eyes and hair like a Viking, he makes my knees weak every time he gives me an order.</p> <p>They hire me to sort out their admin. I spend my days trying to stay professional and my nights tangled in dreams filled with men of ink and sin. But it's when they overhear me talking to a friend about my lack of bedroom experience that things get really interesting.</p> <p>They offer to help in a strictly educational kind of way. They each have a different kink, and they're confident they can help me figure out what I like. They treat it like a game, telling me to score them on satisfaction and technique. A little more experience will help me find Mr. Right-For-Me. At least that's what they say.</p> <p>Except, each night I spend with them makes me more confused.</p> <p>You see, my problem is that I don't want to find someone else. I think I want them all.<br> <br> <b>INKED 8 is a Tattoo Shop Reverse Harem Romance with a happy ever after ending. It's book 6 in the Multiple Love Series of standalone romances with characters who continue to make appearances!</b></p>";
