window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After fifteen years of tending goal for the Boston Rebels, I’m known for two things: the highest save percentage in the league, and never spending more than one night with the same woman.</p> <p>I’m definitely <i>not</i> the guy you should trust with your best friend’s little sister. Especially not when that sister, Jules, is eight years younger and my new roommate.</p> <p>When I witness her on the verge of a panic attack while being intimidated by another man, I don’t think twice about calling her my fiancée and kissing her. Which brings me to the third thing I’m known for: reckless and impulsive decision-making.</p> <p>After a video of that steamy kiss goes viral, the whole world is convinced we’re engaged. If we don’t play along, I risk losing my place as the starting goalie for the Rebels, and Jules’s reputation and career could tank.</p> <p>Our engagement may be fake, but the memories of the way she tastes, and the feel of her body wrapped around mine, are all too real. And the more time we spend together, the less it feels like pretending.</p> <p>None of the secrets from my past seem to matter as much when I’m with her. It turns out, Jules may have some secrets of her own–and uncovering them just might be what heals me…or what finally breaks me.</p>";
