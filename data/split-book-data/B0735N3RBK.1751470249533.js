Three of the Seventine are free and Abigail is running out of time to gather the half-Walkers for the final battle. And on top of that Lucy reveals her latest vision: Abigail must break the melding bond with Brace; if she doesn't, everyone will die. But is there one hope for them? New information from the Walker gathering reveals that there may be a ritual to return the Seventine to their prison. But they need four half-Walkers. And with the Regali half-Walker crowned the Queen-of-the-beasts, she might be the hardest to convince. Abigail has her best chance to save the worlds and her bond with Brace. But will she make it in time? </p>";
