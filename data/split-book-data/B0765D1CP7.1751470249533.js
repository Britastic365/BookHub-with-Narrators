window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Falling in love was never in the cards for Leonidas. An angry witch made sure of that-if he loses his heart, he loses his life. But the treaty guaranteeing peace will die with him, unless he wins the true love of a woman and she bears him a dragonling. When a fiery red-headed witch comes along with plans of her own, 500 years of guarding his heart and opening his bed might not be enough to protect him. </p> <p>Because love is magic...and the fate of the mortal and immortal worlds depends on Rosalyn and Leonidas not only opening their hearts, but surviving a love that's true.... </p> <p>Contains mature themes. </p>";
