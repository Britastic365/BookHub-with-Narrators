window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Easy is the descent into Hell. Especially when you embrace the darkness. And it embraces you back.</p> <p>Revenge is so close I can almost taste it. Belial has brought me everything I wanted and more - he served me vengeance on a silver platter, along with his heart.</p> <p>But my own faults have caused a rift between myself, Lucifer, and Azazel. If I want to destroy Satan and live happily ever after in Hell, hard choices must be made.</p> <p>And when the Dragon himself takes something I hold dear, the choice is final: I must wield the Sword of Light once more, even at the risk of being burned alive.</p> <p>I have no fear. After all, Hell hath no fury like an angel scorned.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
