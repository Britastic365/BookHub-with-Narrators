The Breakers and I were a crew until bad decisions and circumstance ripped us apart.</p> <p>Now the Breakers are back. And they’ve brought trouble.</p> <p>They’re not here at the Stardom Academy to dance. They’re here on a mission for Jeb, the leader of the Skins. He wants something. And me? I’m just a pawn in their game.</p> <p>To make matters worse, my psychotic brother wants something too. I must befriend the Breakers and find out what they’re up to. If I refuse, my brother will hurt the one person I love more than life itself. I cannot allow that to happen.</p> <p>Dance was always the cure to our pain; the foundations of our friendship and love. It brought us together once before. Can I go through the cycle of friendship, love, and heartache all over again? Will I survive the Breakers a second time? Will they survive me?</p> <p><b><i>Lyrical </i></b><b>is book two of Academy of Stardom, a gritty, contemporary reverse-harem romance.
