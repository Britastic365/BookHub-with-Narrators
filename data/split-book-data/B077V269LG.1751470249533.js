window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The unmaking of the world has begun. </b><b><i>The Hyena and the Hawk</i></b><b> is the conclusion to Adrian Tchaikovsky’s epic fantasy trilogy, Echoes of the Fall, following </b><b><i>The Bear and the Serpent</i></b><b>.<br> <br> ‘A classically brilliant fantasy writer’ – Paul Cornell, author of </b><b><i>Witches of Lychford</i></b><br> <br> From the depths of the darkest myths, the soulless Plague People have returned. Their pale-walled camps obliterate villages, just as the terror they bring with them destroys minds. In their wake, nothing is left of the true people: not their places, not their ways. The Plague People will remake the world as though they had never been.<br> <br> The heroes and leaders of the true people – Maniye, Loud Thunder, Hesprec and Asman – will each fight the Plague People in their own ways. They will seek allies, gather armies and lead the charge. But a thousand swords or ten thousand spears will not suffice to turn back this enemy. The end is at hand for everything the true people know . . .<br> <br> <b>Complete the transporting, sweeping coming-of-age fantasy series that began with </b><b><i>The Tiger and the Wolf</i></b><b>.<br> <br> The series is narrated by Kyla Garcia. </b></p>";
