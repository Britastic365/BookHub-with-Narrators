window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The lost warriors are rising.</p> <p>Montana: Vengeance calls upon the wind. What Wolfe has done is unforgivable, and he’ll pay for everything he has taken from us.</p> <p>But after my choice was made at the ceremony, I’m now trapped with the prince I chose, and the path ahead is draped in peril. A wedding looms upon me, and if I can’t find a way to escape, I will soon be a monster’s bride.</p> <p>Erik’s promises fall like fire to ash, and I fear there’s no way out now I’ve chosen a life of chains in payment for those broken vows.</p> <p>But when the gods of old whisper of a new destiny, there may be hope in treading the dangerous road they’ve laid at my feet. Or perhaps this path is steeped in more danger than I’ve ever known.</p> <p>Callie: My choice has cost me everything. My will is bound, and my fate is no longer my own.</p> <p>In my loss, I chose the bloody path of revenge, so now I must make the most of these gifts I’ve been offered.</p> <p>My veins run thick with the power of the slayers, and uncovering each skill is like finding drops of sunlight in the darkest of nights. I must hold on to what these strengths can offer me, and not dwell on what they have taken.</p> <p>Magnar and I are held apart by the gods, and my want for him is ruled by Idun herself.</p> <p>We will never be together again, but I’ll pay that price if it leads me back to my sister.</p> <p>I just pray my heart can take another ruinous wound.</p> <p>***This is a dark, fantasy romance series by the authors of Zodiac Academy with all the enemies to lovers vibes – don’t go expecting a sweet vampire with sparkling skin and a tendency to watch you sleeping. These vampires are savage and bloodthirsty, and the slayer who hunts them will stab first and ask questions later. This war-torn fantasy world is a brutal bi*ch and only those 18+ have a chance at surviving the darkness lurking in this audio. There’s no well-meaning vampires snacking on Bambies instead of babies, and if they get their teeth into you, you’ll be damn lucky to escape with your life ***</p>";
