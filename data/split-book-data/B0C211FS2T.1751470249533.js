window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The epic finale to the best-selling The Fae Chronicles series.</p> <p>War has finally come to Faery. <br> Everything I thought I knew was wrong. <br> Truths have become lies, and they have all begun to unravel around us. I can no longer trust my instincts. <br> Ryder has changed, but so have I. We’re evolving, but into what? I’m not sure, but I do know that it isn’t what I wanted to become. <br> I don’t know if I will survive this war. <br> One of us is holding back, while the other continually moves forward toward the mages who endlessly slaughter the fae. <br> I think it’s me. I think I have to lose it all to gain what is missing inside of me. How do you eradicate self when self is what you’ve been fighting for? <br> Throw everything you think you know about the fae away. Nothing is sacred, and no one is safe from the monsters we’re about to become.</p> <p>Part one of the epic finale. File too large for paperback, so split in two books.</p> <p>Cannot be listened to as a standalone, you'll be so lost you'll need Sherlock to find you. <br> <br> This book is intended for an adult audience with dark, twisted, intense scenes.</p> <p>Listening order is as follows:</p> <p><i>Fighting Destiny <br> Taunting Destiny <br> Escaping Destiny <br> Seducing Destiny <br> A Demon’s Dark Embrace <br> Playing with Monsters <br> Unraveling Destiny <br> Sleeping with Monsters <br> Claiming the Dragon King <br> Oh, Holy Knight <br> Becoming his Monster <br> A Demon’s Plaything <br> The Winter Court <br> If She’s Wicked <br> Embracing Destiny <br> Crowning Destiny</i></p>";
