window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Forrest Winters isn’t just a federal fire marshal; he’s a thorn in Ranger Sierra Betts’ side. The way he swings his big axe, fixes her with his chameleon gray eyes, and talks about his jurisdiction has a way of breaking her concentration. He has a way of showing up everywhere he doesn’t belong, including Greenbrier Ranger Station. And he really needs to quit stealing her bacon bites.</p> <p>When a series of suspicious fires, an underhanded co-worker, and a cagey Parks Police Chief threaten her job and the park itself, Sierra grudgingly agrees to partner with Forrest. Their side investigation may be her best shot at preventing the framing of an innocent man. But can his firefighting expertise and her detective skills lead them to the real arsonist before Forrest breaks her with his charm?</p> <p><i>Forrest for the Trees is a full-length contemporary romance, can be listened to as a stand-alone, and is Book 1 in the Green Valley Heroes series, Green Valley Chronicles, Penny Reid Book Universe.</i></p>";
