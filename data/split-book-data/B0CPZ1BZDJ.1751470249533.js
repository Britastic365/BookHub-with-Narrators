window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Shadow Crown </i>is a spicy fantasy romance novel that continues the story of Fiaa as the sequel to <i>Fox Fire</i>. We follow the story of Fiaa as she navigates a world that is foreign to her, full of unknown magic and untapped potential. She has the ability to break a long-withstanding curse, which comes at a great personal cost. The use of her magic to its extremes, paired with her recovery from extremely traumatic events, leaves her exhausted and feeling as if she lacks autonomy despite being a truly strong Faerie. Drawing upon her bonds—familial with Keelan, mated with Ryker—gives her strength, but even they can’t satisfy her ravenous hunger the more her life unfolds.</p>";
