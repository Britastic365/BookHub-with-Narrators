The sister’s ex.</p> <p>Life would be complicated enough if we didn’t have to navigate a social circle populated with serial killers.</p> <p>My father has gathered a loyal group of monsters around himself like a shield.</p> <p>There’s the black widow, the arsonist, the mild-mannered poet with a penchant for blood, the crooked cop, and, of course, the Seattle Slayer.</p> <p>Maintaining three new romances is nearly as dangerous a proposition.</p> <p>Oh, and my biological mother? She knows about the boys, but not the killers.</p> <p>My original kidnapper—the woman I thought was my mom—she knows about the killers and not the boys.</p> <p>Some days, it feels like the entire world is a web of secrets and deceit—much of it spun by yours truly.</p> <p>The girl I once knew as Dakota Banks is fading like a distant star.</p> <p>The question is: how far will I let my father push me?</p> <p>He might have an app that records and watches everything; he might have a plan of righteous revenge. But there are two things the Seattle Slayer doesn’t understand: love and loyalty. He thought he could drive us apart when all he did was push us closer together.</p> <p>And together, we are stronger.</p> <p>This is the endgame, Dad.</p> <p>Let’s finish this.</p> <p>ENDGAME ROMANCE is a 200,000 word love-hate/high school romance with suspense/thriller themes. This is a reverse harem novel, meaning the main character has more than one love interest. This is book three of four in the series.</p>";
