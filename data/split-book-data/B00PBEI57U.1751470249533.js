window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>For Kate Mitchell, finishing her master's thesis on reclusive photographer Reed O'Connor was just another item to check off her list. She knew exactly what she was doing. Or did she? There's just one portrait that doesn't fit. One portrait... and the passion she sees behind it. Finding the story behind O'Connor's picture becomes Kate's obsession, and the people she meets will challenge everything she thought she knew about life, love, and inspiration. A single picture can tell more than one story. And in the end, Kate discovers that every real love story is a unique work of art.</p>";
