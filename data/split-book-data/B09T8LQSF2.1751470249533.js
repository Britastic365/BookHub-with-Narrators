window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>They took us in the middle of the night and forced us to do things together…things I don’t dare admit.</i></b></p> <p>They came and took us in the middle of the night - kidnapped us and locked us in an attic - me and my stepbrother Jake. They’re some kind of cult - the Worshipers of the Moon - and they say that Jake and I are the last of the Royal Weres. We’re the last two with the blood of the First Wolf and because of that, we’re their only hope.</p> <p>But now they want me to do things with Jake - things I know I shouldn’t do. Things that could get me in a lot of trouble nine months down the line.</p> <p>It’s frightening, but Jake is protective and gentle - he understands what we need to do in order to get free. The only trouble is, our plan might prove disastrous in more than one way.</p> <p>The cult members keep telling me that Jake is my Alpha and I am his Omega - his to claim, his to take. But when we finally get away from them, we don’t dare to tell anyone what they made us do together.</p> <p><b><i>For the penalty for our sins in the Were world…is death.</i></b></p> <p><b><i>Author's Note number one - This is a dark romance - some scary things happen to the heroine. However, the hero is not abusive to her - they are in this situation together. But if you have ever been kidnapped or abused, please be aware that parts of this book may be triggering. Please listen responsibly. (PS - I promise it turns out okay in the end.)</i></b></p> <p><b><i>Author's note number two - This is a STEPbrother book. There is no blood relation between the hero and the heroine. They are completely unrelated. I also want to stress that everyone in this book is over 18 - none of the characters are underage.</i></b></p>";
