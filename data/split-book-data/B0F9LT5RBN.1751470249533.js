A new job in a new city is her chance to finally break free from her overbearing yet well-meaning mother, not to mention her small-town notoriety as NHL superstar Ben Michaels’ little sister. But her dream of independence hits an unexpected snag when a housing mishap leaves her with no choice but to move in with Ben’s best friend and teammate, the broody (and gorgeous) Foster James.</p> <p>As a top goalie, Foster has always been great at handling high-pressure decisions and sticking to the rules. But there is one rule he finds impossible to follow: don’t fall for your best friend’s sister. After years of being alone, resisting the sweet and funny Beth may be the toughest challenge he has ever faced.</p> <p>The goal was to keep their relationship under wraps, but plans have a way of becoming tangled during the holidays.</p>";
