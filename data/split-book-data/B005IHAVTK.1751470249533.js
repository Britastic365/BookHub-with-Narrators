window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The grave is one wrong step away. </p> <p>Having narrowly averted an (under)world war, Cat Crawfield wants nothing more than a little downtime with her vampire husband, Bones. Unfortunately, her gift from New Orleans’ voodoo queen just keeps on giving - leading to a personal favor that sends them into battle once again, this time against a villainous spirit. </p> <p>Centuries ago, Heinrich Kramer was a witch hunter. Now, every All Hallows Eve, he takes physical form to torture innocent women before burning them alive. This year, however, a determined Cat and Bones must risk all to send him back to the other side of eternity - forever. But how do you kill a killer who’s already long dead? </p> <p>Jeaniene Frost, <i>New York Times</i> and <i>USA Today</i> best-selling author, lives with her husband and their very spoiled dog in Florida. Although not a vampire herself, she confesses to having pale skin, wearing a lot of black, and sleeping in late whenever possible. Aside from writing, she enjoys reading, poetry, exploring old cemeteries, spelunking, and traveling - by car. Airplanes, children, and cookbooks frighten her.</p>";
