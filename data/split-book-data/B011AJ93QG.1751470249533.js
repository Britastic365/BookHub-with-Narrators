Has Remy been lying all along about his feelings for her? Had she been a fool to believe he really could love her? Remy has been accused of trying to leave Sabine and his responsibilities to Bastian behind. </p> <p>He's been locked up and drained of his lifeblood to the point that he has no memory of what has happened since just after Sabine officially became \"his\". In a house full of vampires, not being paired has put Sabine into quite the predicament. Luckily for her, she's managed to make a couple of powerful allies who are more than willing to help her out in any way they can. It's up to Sabine to figure out the truth about Remy and how the secret of Willow Creek can help or hinder her quest to be free. </p>";
