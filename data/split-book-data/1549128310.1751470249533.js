Whether this heralds the destruction of humankind or something worse will depend on two women.</p> <p>Essun has inherited the power of Alabaster Tenring. With it, she hopes to find her daughter, Nassun, and forge a world in which every orogene child can grow up safe. <br> For Nassun, her mother's mastery of the Obelisk Gate comes too late.
