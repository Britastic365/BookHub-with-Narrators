window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Nothing is permanent. Not even death.</b></p> <p>I'm Bree Mortimer, and I can bring ghosts back to life.</p> <p>The hot-as-Hades Roman Centurion in my bedroom is living proof that I can raise the dead. Now, all I have to do is stop him from swimming naked in the duck pond and trying to stab anyone with a man bun, and my life will be perfect.</p> <p>Hah. That's a joke. My life is a spooktacular failure. I've got two ghostly lovers who are desperate for me to bring them back, too, but if I don't figure out how to control my new magical powers, there could be grave consequences.</p> <p>That's going to be difficult since the only person who can help me was ripped to pieces by a monster who can't possibly be human. Some dark power is after resurrection magic, and if I don't figure out how to stop it, I'm next.</p> <p>Luckily, with a sword-wielding psychotic ex-ghost, a sarcastic royal rake, a cinnamon roll Victorian gentleman, a sadistic bat, a vampire-slaying bookshop owner, and the village undertaker on my side, I stand a ghost of a chance. Right?</p> <p>Bree and her ghostly men are back for another spooky adventure in <i>If You've Got It, Haunt It, </i>book two of this darkly humorous cozy fantasy series by bestselling author Steffanie Holmes. If you love a sarcastic heroine, hot, possessive, and slightly unhinged ghostly men, a mystery to solve, and a little kooky, spooky lovin' to set your coffin a rockin', then quit ghouling around and start listening!</p>";
