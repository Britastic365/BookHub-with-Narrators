window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Despite being dumped on a primitive alien world, Lily is adapting to life there, with the help of Frrar, Tor, and Arruk. But they can’t stay in the safety of the caves forever. The flood waters have receded and it’s time to join the rest of the tribe... </p> <p>While traveling, their group meets a familiar face from Arruk’s past - a man half feral and covered in vicious scars. Something about him draws Lily in, despite those who already hold her heart. But that isn’t her biggest concern. </p> <p>Can Lily keep the Tribe Mother from discovering just how much being with her has changed her new mates? Will the tribe accept her, a stranger in their lands? Or will Lily have to fight the very people who were supposed to offer her safety and a home? </p> <p>Note: This is a full length novel, is not a stand-alone, and ends on a slight cliffhanger.</p>";
