window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A man of action...</b></p> <p>Fearless. Loyal. Brilliant. Ruthless. Bold words are always used to describe English war hero Captain Chase Eversea, but another word unfortunately plays a role in every Eversea's destiny: trouble. And trouble for Chase arrives in the form of a mysterious message summoning him to a London rendezvous...where he encounters the memory of his most wicked indiscretion in the flesh: Rosalind March - the only woman he could never forget.</p> <p><b>A woman of passion...</b></p> <p>Five years ago, the reckless, charming beauty craved the formidable Captain's attention. But now, Rosalind is a coolly self-possessed woman, and desire is the last thing on her mind: Her sister has mysteriously disappeared, and she needs Chase's help to find her. But as their search through London's darkest corners re-ignites long-smoldering passion and memories of old battles, Chase and Rosalind are challenged to surrender: to the depths of a wicked desire, and to the possibility of love.</p> <p><b>Contains mature themes.</b></p>";
