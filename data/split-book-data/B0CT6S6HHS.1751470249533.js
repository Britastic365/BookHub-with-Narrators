window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I was supposed to be on vacation on Earth, resting after I helped Pan defeat Hook and free the realms. I didn't expect to meet Cassandra, a woman with a soul full of the most beautiful music I've ever heard. Nor did I expect my encounter with her to consume my mind.</p> <p>But my father Zeus is determined to exert his power over me, to reinforce his dominance and ensure that I'm no threat to him. Because of his suspicion and envy, visiting Cassandra on Earth is more complicated and dangerous than I anticipated.</p> <p>She's so full of sadness and beauty. I crave her like I've craved no one else in this lifetime. But her pain makes her wary, so I have to move slowly, and sing softly.</p> <p>I've never met anyone like her. And I'm not sure I can resist her.</p> <p>Contains mature themes. Trigger and content warnings are available on the author's website.</p>";
