window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Warning: </b>You can expect a kick butt supernatural bounty hunter and a <i>possessive</i> demon love interest. They both have a lot of growing to do. If you don't like flawed characters that have to improve—this one won't be for you. <i>Demons of New Chicago</i> is slow-burn but high steam. It was written for the readers that struggle to find books that have enough action <i>and</i> romance.<br> <br> If you enjoy the <i>Kate Daniels</i> series by Ilona Andrews, the <i>Fever</i> series by Karen Marie Moning, or <i>Demon Days and Vampire Nights</i> by K.F. Breene then dive right in to the dangerous depths of New Chicago. Beware of headstrong heroines with snark. These ladies don’t bark. They bite.</p> <p><b><i>I’m hired to stop a demon summoning. The last thing I expect is to end up bonded to one instead.</i></b></p> <p>Being a supernatural bounty hunter isn’t exactly a popular job. But after the magic wars, there aren’t many things a human can do that will put food on the table.</p> <p>Thankfully anything my right hook can’t handle, my guns can.</p> <p>Or so I thought.</p> <p>When a demon summoning runs awry, the being that comes into this world changes everything.</p> <p>I’m not sure if he’s truly a monster or a god, but one look into his flame filled eyes and I know–Ronan will never let me go.</p> <p>If he can catch me, that is.</p> <p><i>Game on, motherf*cker.</i></p>";
