window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Willa Knight: Dweller? Sol? Accidental evolutionary hiccup? Willa has never been a particularly useful dweller: she isn’t very good at chores, she isn’t very good at worshipping, she isn’t very good at not having opinions, and she isn’t very good with rules—but none of that matters anymore. The rules are changing.</p> <p>The dwellers are trying to make their own way in the world, and Willa can’t seem to help getting tangled up in their plans. Luckily, she has the Abcurse brothers to help her out—until she doesn’t, and suddenly she’s alone again in a world on the brink of chaos. With the Abcurses gone, she’ll have to rely on her wits, and her sister Emmy, to stay under the radar and survive. Because someone wants her dead. But, really, what else is new?</p> <p>This is a full novel, 90,000 words. Book 3 of 5 in the Curse of the Gods Series</p>";
