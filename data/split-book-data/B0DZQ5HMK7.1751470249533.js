Together, the Seaworths wield magic derived from the surrounding waters to keep the human population safe from paranormal threats. But Linney has always longed for a more adventurous life ... which is exactly what she gets when handsome newcomer Gray Brockhurst shows up on the Island.</p> <p>Gray just inherited one of Starfall’s oldest ghost tour companies. Even though he’s never believed in ghosts, he’s continuing the family business to honor his late grandfather, who relished in sharing the island’s lore. But Gray is thrown for a loop when a lovely local interrupts his tour and changes his entire world view. Apparently, ghosts are all too real, and he’s been offending them with inaccurate stories during his “performances.”</p> <p>But soon the Seaworths face a bigger problem: A deadly enemy has been unleashed, and it’s unlike anything they’ve ever encountered. As Linney and Gray work together to stop it, the attraction brewing between them just might be the most powerful magic of all.</p>";
