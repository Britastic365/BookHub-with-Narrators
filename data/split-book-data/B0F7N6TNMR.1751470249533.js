window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From romance author Robin Lynn comes a fantastical adventure in art, life, magic, and love to remind us that we are not what happened to us, we are what we choose to become. <i>In a world</i> where an artist's magic brings tattoos to life, ink gone wrong can spell lasting heartache for those unlucky enough to experience it. Jaded and cynical on both life and love, tattoo artist Ashton Andrews is about to find out that even the most deeply-etched scars can transform into something beautiful when the right person is holding the pen.<br> <br> Having carried the burden of intentionally-ruined ink on his skin (and the matching scars on his psyche that come with such betrayal), Ashton is understandably reluctant to trust. He’s entirely content to bury his nose in the fantasy worlds created by his favorite author, rather than risk his heart in the real one.…<br> <br> On the other hand, he would like his tattoo fixed.<br> <br> Enter Link Remington: magical tattoo artist extraordinaire, devastatingly handsome media darling, and co-owner of the famed tattoo studio, <i>Soul Survivor</i>. Ashton knows that Link has the artistic chops to repair his skin, but is completely unprepared for the charming, persistent, and impossibly understanding man to find a place inside his heart. Working together has Ashton realizing that there’s more to Link than his public persona, the art on his body, and the image he’s created Link has his own scars to heal, but with a charm or two, a dash of creativity, and equal leaps of faith, perhaps the enchanted ink the two of them create together will be the beginning of something positively magical.</p>";
