It’s not until a mysterious man from her past, Briggs Andrews, steps in that she begins to question the friendship and love she held so close to her heart. Rose begins to face the harsh reality that August could never be the man she wanted him to be, but turning to Briggs Andrews might be the end of the safe life she worked so hard for.</p> <p>Claiming his Rose was always going to be messy.</p> <p>Briggs Andrews knew he should have stayed away. He knew the consequences of getting involved—of getting too close to the one person he ruined all those years ago. But staying away from Rose was becoming harder than he thought possible. He never felt worthy of anything until her, never believed he’d want to break down those carefully constructed walls just to be with her. But those walls were crumbling down faster than either anticipated. Love hangs in the balance, muddled between lines that are crossed and secrets that begin to unravel, bringing change neither could have envisioned.</p>";
