As a pilot, his skill is unmatched. He doesn't like the unpredictable, and humans are exactly that. </p> <p>One by one, he's seen his brothers fall to these confounding creatures. Even the most battle-hardened and ruthless of them have succumbed to the Mating Fever. </p> <p>Humans are trouble. Humans bring chaos. Always.</p> <p>When he encounters the strange human called Tasha, all his warning alarms go off. She isn't anything like the other humans. She's faster, stronger—artificially so. She has secrets; she tells lies.</p> <p>A trail of blood-scent lingers around her. She is not the kind of human he would imagine as his mate. But Lodan's control is about to be sorely tested—in more ways than one.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
