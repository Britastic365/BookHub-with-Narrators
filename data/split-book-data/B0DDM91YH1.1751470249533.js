window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>I made a thoughtless decision, then I lost my princes…</b></p> <p>Apparently, the best time to ask someone a life-or-death question is when they're fresh from being kidnapped and tired as hell. Who knew?</p> <p>Now, my princes are gone to a terrible place, and it's up to me to bring them back. To do so, not only do I need to learn to survive in a new world of darkness and lies, but I need to decide how I feel and what I want for my life.</p> <p>Rescuing the princes is only the first step. Agreeing to turn this fake marriage into a real one is the next—if I can handle it. And then? Well, I need to figure out if I can be the wife to four men tricked by a potion.</p> <p>Fury of the Kings <i>is a steamy fantasy reverse harem with a sassy heroine, lots of humor, and four sexy princes that only our heroine can resist.</i></p>";
