window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Traded for peace. Sacrificed to a monster.</b></p> <p>Maia Fremont just wanted a chance. When the opportunity to create floral arrangements for the royal wedding is offered to her, who is she to say no? But the crown is never honest, and soon enough, she finds herself thrust into an unwanted union with a fearsome troll. Ripped from her beloved garden and the only life she's ever known, she's offered as a bride to a creature she's only heard whispers of—rumors of brutality, darkness, and insatiable hunger.</p> <p>Ragnar, a powerful troll healer, is disgusted by the human king's deception. His duty to his people forces him to accept this lie of a marriage. His bride is a fragile human instead of the strong half-elfen mate he expected. Her meager magic is an insult, but honor and allegiance bind him to her. No matter how much he hates it.</p> <p>Married to a beast who sees her as nothing more than a tool to strengthen his bloodline, Maia must fight for her life in the treacherous world of the trolls. But in their kingdom deep within the mountain, she must balance her growing attraction for her gruff, surprisingly poetic husband against the lurking dangers in this strange new world—especially when the growing darkness threatens to tear them apart.</p>";
