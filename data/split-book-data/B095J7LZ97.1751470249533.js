Since then, he’d made new friends, but every encounter only emphasized how ordinary his life was. </p> <p>Eighteen years was very young for a vampire. During that time, Honey hadn’t seen much. What she lacked in experience, she made up for in intelligence. </p> <p>When a violent car accident happened right before Honey’s eyes, she jumped into action. </p> <p>Aiden was on the brink of death. He felt himself slipping away, then someone appeared. But she didn’t rescue him. She plunged him deeper into pain and darkness. </p> <p>Being made into a vampire was an excruciating experience. Once the agony receded, Aiden had to embrace his powers.
