window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Native American of the Blackfeet Nation, Lani Running Bear ends her service in the Army Military Police corps, and returns to the reservation to help her people as a law enforcement officer. When members of her tribe turn up dead, she doesn't know who she can trust, and calls on a man she’d busted while deployed. A man with the one qualification that would allow him to live on the reservation with her. </p> <p>Fresh out of the Army, and new to Brotherhood Protectors, Zachariah Jones is prime for his first assignment as the undercover fiancé of a tribal police officer from the Blackfeet Reservation - a woman he'd butted heads with on deployment in Afghanistan. With tensions running high, Zach and Lani fight to find the killers before more lives are lost. When the killer targets Lani, Zach will do anything to keep the woman he's falling in love with safe. </p>";
