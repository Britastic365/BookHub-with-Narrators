The </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author of the Thrawn trilogy is back with a wholly original short story of first contact.</b></p> <p>En route to far-off stars, Toby’s consciousness has a crucial mission: inhabit his clone long enough to repair a spaceship, then zip back to Earth. He’s done it a million times, more or less. OK, twelve times. It should only take a few hours.</p> <p>Until he wakes up in jail. And he’s not alone.</p> <p>His fellow prisoners: a cadre of alien soldiers. His prison: an ethereal boundary that will imprison their spirits until their bodies die. His jailers can’t even see him. But their pet cat (er, iguana cat?) can—and it’s got a serious case of the zoomies.</p> <p>With humanity’s place in the odd and ever-widening universe riding on Toby’s choices, it’s time to saddle up for a ghostly game of cat and mouse.</p>";
