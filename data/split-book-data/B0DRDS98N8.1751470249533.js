window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The day I rode to the Rift with my brother the king, I never expected him to deliver me into the hands of our enemies. Desperate to stop the Deepnight from covering his kingdom in shadow, he's pledged me as a blood slave to King Laurent, ruler of the vampire kingdom of Nor Doru.</p> <p>Survival means giving Laurent my vein and my body. And when his cruel and arrogant general, Varick, demands the same, I must obey.</p> <p>But all is not as it seems in the vampire court. King Laurent has secrets, not the least of which is how much he enjoys his general's company. Almost from the moment I enter the twilight world of the Deepnight, I learn my journey across the Rift was so much more than a barter. And it's not just Laurent and Varick I need to be wary of. There are rumors of darkness stirring—of long-forgotten danger rising in the old elven lands.</p> <p>Something is stirring in me, too. As I unravel the secrets of the vampire court and discover my own hidden abilities, I must choose between love and survival. Trapped between two powerful men, will I become a pawn in the battle for power, or will I take control of my own fate?</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
