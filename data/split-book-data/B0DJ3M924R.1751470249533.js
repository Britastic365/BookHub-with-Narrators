window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>What's your safeword?</i><br> <br> Firefighter Tripp Truett is falling without a net, tumbling headfirst into a whole new kind of relationship with his enigmatic paramedic best friend, Leander. What was only meant to be mutual relief from their high-stress jobs is quickly developing into something more, but with all the missed signals and crossed wires, can these two ever figure out that they're so much closer to the same page than they think?<br> <br> Ride along as Tripp and Lee navigate the razor-thin ledge between rescue and ruin to find themselves, each other, and what it really means to burn. Their scorchingly hot exploration of *enthusiastically* consensual domination and submission is a surprisingly tender, adrenaline-laced, modern queer love story that pushes the boundaries between friendship, love, lust, and Tripp’s dawning realization that with Lee, the space beyond his comfort zone is the safest place he’ll ever be.<br> <br> <b>Fire &amp; Ice: the Extended Edition</b> brings high-octane heat, consensual power dynamic exploration, queer-centered Igbtq+ representation, and Level 5 Spice--<i>without </i>sacrificing captivating character development and a plot-driven narrative storyline. Competently written from all angles, Fire &amp; Ice pulls back the curtain on two different subcultures and psyches with both technical accuracy and heart. Whether novice or expert to either emergency services or the BD.SM Community, this steamy workplace romance offers a fresh, front-line perspective, as well as an immersive, accessible listen for everyone from the vaguely-curious rookie to the thirty-year vet.<br> <br> With brand-new, display-worthy cover art and fifty+ pages of additional content in the form of a narrative postscript that cleverly flips Lee and Trip's comfortable dynamic on its head, the extended edition is a can't-miss collectible to treasure.<br> <br> Releasing alongside extended edition ebook and audio versions. Audiobook read by award-winning narrator, Teddy Hamilton.</p>";
