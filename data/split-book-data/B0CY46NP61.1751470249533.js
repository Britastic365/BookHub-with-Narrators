So cherished.</b></p> <p>As we work to obliterate our enemies and solve the mysteries of my past—a past that very well holds the key to unlocking my lost magic and breaking their curse—my gargoyles and I have grown <i>impossibly</i> close.</p> <p>But with every enemy destroyed and clue uncovered, through every searing kiss and filthy, forbidden touch, something dark is awakening inside me.</p> <p><b>Something... </b><b><i>hungry</i></b><b>.</b></p> <p>The gargoyles told me that committing violence takes something from you—and they would know.</p> <p>But for me?
