window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>My name is Ace Bissett, and I’m a paranormal detective who doesn’t believe in magic.<br> <br> Or at least, I didn’t before I met <i>them.</i><br> <br> The day I inherited my aunt’s old house, everything changed. One moment, I was convinced that magic was a hoax. The next, I’m surrounded by four winged, fanged, ridiculously hot guys who are definitely <i>not</i> human, and who insist that I'm the only one who can break the curse that binds them to the night.<br> <br> I know I should run far, far away from this hot mess, but there's a connection between us I can't deny. I'm seeing things I can't explain, feeling things that don't make sense. The detective in me has never been able to resist a mystery, and this one is just begging me to dig in.<br> <br> But all that will have to wait, because there’s a new threat stalking my city. One with a taste for blood and bone, unable to be killed or captured by normal human means.<br> <br> It’s a good thing I’ve got four new roommates to help me hunt them down. But even if I didn’t, I’d figure out a way. Because I never give up. I never give in. And I <i>always</i> protect what’s mine.<br> <br> <b>Don't miss this delicious new reverse harem series.
