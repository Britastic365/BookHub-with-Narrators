I need him to teach me how to fight so I can protect myself.</p> <p>Our arrangement is simple… until it's not.</p> <p>Being close to him and feeling his sweaty body against mine makes it impossible to not want more. And once I start touching, I can't stop.</p> <p>I know he's dangerous. I know I should stay away. But I also know I won't, because every part of me is already his.</p> <p>He just needs to take it.</p> <p><b>Lev</b></p> <p>Violence and rage—it's all I know. Until I meet her.</p> <p>She makes me want things that a man like me doesn't deserve.</p> <p>I can't bring her into my life and put her in danger, no matter how much I might want to keep her for myself.</p> <p>But fate has other plans.</p> <p>Now she's mine, bought and paid for, and too damn innocent for what I want to do to her.</p> <p><i>This is the third book in the Melnikov Bratva series. Each book features a different brother, and although each love story will be complete, the storyline started in the first book will not be completed until the last. These books should be listened to in order in order. This is a very steamy dark Bratva romance for mature listeners.</i></p>";
