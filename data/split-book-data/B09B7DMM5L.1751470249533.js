How can Riley fit in anywhere when he doesn’t know who or what he is?</b></p> <p>With his mysterious heritage shrouded in shadow, Riley Shepard struggles with his identity, his confusing sexuality, and the prohibited - but deepening - feelings for his guardian angels. Questions remain unanswered. His guardians harbor secrets. And danger lurks just out of sight.</p> <p>When disaster strikes, Riley must make a choice that will change everything. But will his sacrifice destroy the life he’s built? Will there be anything left when the dust settles?</p> <p>To him, it makes no difference. Because for them, it is worth the risk.</p> <p><i>Sacrifice</i> is the second book in the slow-burn harem/poly romance series Fire &amp; Brimstone, featuring hurt/comfort, temptingly sexy guardian angels, forbidden love, and an unlikely hero who discovers what it means to be free. </p> <p><b>Trigger warnings include: </b>situations of homophobia (both external and internal), violence with low-level gore, and sexual assault.</p>";
