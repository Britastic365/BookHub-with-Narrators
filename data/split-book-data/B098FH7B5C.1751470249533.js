window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Seven brothers. Seven brides. A revenge seven years in the making.</b> </p> <p>I never wanted any part of my family’s revenge, but no one asked my opinion when my oldest brother handed out the brides during Lammas. Now, I’m saddled with Monroe, heir to the Amazon faction. She’s as deadly as she is wild and the opposite of the woman I really want. Shiloh. My best friend.</p> <p>The night Monroe and I consummate our handfasting is like nothing I’ve experienced before. It’s dark and brutal and intoxicating in a way I’m not prepared for. Which means it can never happen again.</p> <p>But now, every time I turn around, I find Monroe and Shiloh together. She’s spitefully seducing my best friend, the woman I love, and there’s not a damn thing I can do about it.</p> <p>I can’t have one without the other, but letting Monroe close means I might lose myself completely.</p> <p><b>Content warning: </b>history of child abuse (physical)</p>";
