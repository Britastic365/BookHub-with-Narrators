Unexpectedly.</p> <p>Seven years ago, a vile experience tore the two of them apart, leaving them shadows of their former selves. Ghosts to each other. A <i>haunting. </i><br> A haunting so deeply embedded that Linc now lives a reclusive life—hiding out in the Santa Monica mountains with his only friend, Ellis. A quiet existence. <i>Without her.</i><br> Paige has barely made it through the loneliest year of her life. <i>Without him,</i> and now, without her Gram. After moving to Hollywood last year, she spends her nights dancing at LA’s most exclusive burlesque club, with only the memory of his dark hazel eyes watching her.<br> When Paige and Linc’s lives unexpectedly collide at the club, they quickly realize their memories of what happened all those years ago are not the same.<br> But the gravity of seeing each other again is a crushing weight, and the years of separation have given their trauma nothing but time and space to fester.<br> Though one thing is clear, even through the blurry, fractured memories . . .<br> What happened to them sure as hell wasn’t<i> the end.</i></p>";
