window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Darius Keyes learned the hard way that women weren’t to be trusted. Betrayed in the most dangerous way, he left the military with his deepest scars invisible to the naked eye. He doesn’t need a woman; his mistress is his motorcycle club. And who needs love when he’s already married to the pursuit of justice? He was set in solitude, until an ongoing case brings him straight to the home of Athena Holman—his high school sweetheart.</p> <p>Athena is just as beautiful as the day Darius broke her heart. He can’t believe she’s involved with a criminal, but before he can confront her, a sudden attack leaves her defenseless in his arms.</p> <p>In an instant, Athena is rendered temporarily blind and completely vulnerable. A motorcycle garage is no place for a wounded woman, but Darius will do anything to protect her—and atone for how he once treated her. There’s only one problem: Athena can’t see him and doesn’t recognize his voice. To her, Darius is nothing more than the Good Samaritan who saved her life… and he doesn’t correct her.</p> <p>Darius knows there are lines that shouldn’t be crossed, but when he’s around her, he can’t stay away… and she doesn’t want him to. Tenderness turns to trust. Trust turns to touch. And touch tempts him to tell her the truth—that he’s no hero, but the man who was once the villain in her story.</p> <p>Unfortunately, fate doesn’t leave him with a choice. Someone wants Athena dead, and to save her life Darius will have to put his heart on the line and reveal the secret he’s fought so hard to conceal.</p>";
