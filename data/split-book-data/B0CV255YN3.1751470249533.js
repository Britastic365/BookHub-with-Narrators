Each book in the series features a different couple and can be listened to as a standalone with a happily ever after, but for maximum enjoyment, follow the recommended listening order. A dark romance with adult themes, Vicious Seduction may not be suitable for sensitive audiences as it deals with matters of past sexual assault. </i><br> <br> A Note from the Author: Rivals to lovers has never been as deliciously seductive as Oran and Lina’s story. Bold, determined, and ruthless, these two go head-to-head, and the result is explosive in the most delectable way. Get ready for sexual tension dripping from every captivating page!<br> <br> For those of you who are new to me, I write what I'd call \"mafia lite.\" My heroes are hardened criminals with soft spots for their heroines. There may be violence and cruelty in my books, but never between the main characters. Enjoy!</p>";
