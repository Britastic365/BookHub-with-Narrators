Here dangerous associations and meticulous plots are far more dangerous and cutthroat than any game she survived in Halálház.</p> <p>If her life wasn’t complicated enough, her relationship with the infamous legend is growing stronger. The more she tries to untangle the link between Warwick and her, the thicker it wraps around them both, entwining them in a world between life and death, where brutal passion and fury collide. When whispers of a coveted magical substance called \"the nectar\" start buzzing louder, Brexley’s strange bond to the fae book leads her on an unexpected journey that brings her closer to the answers she seeks.</p> <p>But once she opens the door, all the secrets and lies of her past come flooding out, including truths she’s not ready to face...and betrayals that cut bone deep.</p>";
