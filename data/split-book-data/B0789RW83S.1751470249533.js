window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Welcome to Everlasting, Maine, where there's no such thing as normal.</p> <p>Charlotte Fenchurch knows that, which is why she's not that surprised when a very special book of magic falls into her hands at the library where she works. As a fledgling witch, owning her own grimoire is a dream come true. But there’s something... mysterious about the book she just can’t figure out.</p> <p>Leopard shifter Walker Black knows what's odd about the book. It’s full of black magic and so dangerous that it could destroy the world. Good thing the Fraternal Order of Light has sent him to Everlasting to recover it and put it into safe storage. If he has to, he'll even take the witch who owns it into custody.</p> <p>That is until he meets Charlotte and realizes she's not out to watch the world burn. She's sweet and kind and wonderful. Suddenly, protecting her is all he wants to do. Well, that and kiss her some more. But dark forces seem determined to get their hands on the book, making Charlotte their target, and Walker worries that he won't be able to protect her from them - or the organization he works for.</p> <p>Can Walker and Charlotte survive the onslaught of danger? Or is that just \"witchful\" thinking?</p>";
