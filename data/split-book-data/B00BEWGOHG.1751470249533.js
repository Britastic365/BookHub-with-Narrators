window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Wild Invitation</i> is an exciting collection of Psy/Changeling stories from <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Nalini Singh. In \"Beat of Temptation\", innocent Tamsyn has always had a place in her heart for Nathan, a blooded DarkRiver sentinel. But is she ready for the fierce demands of the mating bond? In \"Stroke of Enticement\", a wary young teacher, skeptical about love, arouses the man - and the animal - in an aggressive leopard changeling who must prove his affections are true. </p> <p>The collection also features two never-before-published novellas: In \"Declaration of Courtship\", Grace, a shy, submissive wolf, finds herself pursued by the last man she ever would have imagined: a SnowDancer lieutenant said to be \"mad, bad, and dangerous to know\". In \"Texture of Intimacy\", SnowDancer healer Lara discovers the searing joys - and unexpected challenges - of being mated to quiet, powerful Walker, a man used to keeping his silence.</p>";
