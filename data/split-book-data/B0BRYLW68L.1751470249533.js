window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I've been separated from Atlan, and there's definitely something creepy and deadly going on in this bunker. This isn't the rescue mission we were told it was. No, this is a trap, and we've been lured here on purpose by a beautiful, monstrous man. I'm not sure why he wants Atlan and me, but I need to find out, because this new enemy just might be more dangerous than the zombie hordes racing across the plains. But what if the bunker also holds humanity's best hope for survival? The second installment in this dystopian vampire romance ratchets up the heat level and the danger, introducing new monsters and unfolding the cause of the zombie outbreak! For fans of Laura Thalassa and Jennifer L. Armentrout. Contains mature themes. Trigger and content warnings are available on the author's website.</p>";
