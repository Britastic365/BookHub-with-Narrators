window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>First, he marked me. Then, he took me.</b></p> <p>I know how to handle men who won't take no for an answer, but Silas isn't a man. He's a beast who takes what he wants, as long and hard and savagely as he pleases, and tonight, he wants me. </p> <p>He's not even pretending he's going to be gentle. He's going to ravage me, and it's going to hurt.</p> <p>I'll be spanked into quivering submission and used thoroughly and shamefully, but even when the endless series of helpless, screaming climaxes is finally over, I won't just be sore and spent.</p> <p>I will be marked.</p> <p>My body will no longer be mine. It will be his to use, enjoy, and breed, and no matter how desperate my need might grow in his absence, it will respond to his touch alone.</p> <p>Forever.</p> <p><b>Publisher's note:</b> <i>Marked</i> includes spankings, rough sexual scenes, intense and humiliating punishments, and strong D/S themes. If such material offends you, please don't buy this book.</p>";
