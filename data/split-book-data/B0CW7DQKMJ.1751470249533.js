window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>My Ex. My Liar. My Demon.</p> <p>My type is bad boys that will screw me over and leave me walking funny. No matter how much they tempt me or my ruined heartâ€”I know better than to trust my own taste in men.</p> <p>My ex taught me that love isn't sweet, patient, or kind. It's cruel and it hurts. He'll do anything for a second chance, but I can't forget the flames that burned me from the inside out three years ago. My liar is forbidden, but I'm haunted by his slate blue eyes and wicked mouth. He's gotten under my skin, and I don't know how to remove him without tearing my heart apart in the process. My devil may be bad, but he makes promises that sound so good. I wish I could say he tricked me with honeyed words, but really, I did it to myself. Bonding to him was a mistake, but bargaining with him? It might be my undoing.</p> <p>I'm torn between three men that I swore I wouldn't get involved with. I know it's wrong, but part of me loves it. Craves it.</p> <p>Everyone thinks I'm the good girl, but what they don't see is that my carefully crafted persona is crumbling around me. My mask is cracked. I'm hanging on by a thread.</p> <p>We all have weaknesses. Mine just make me a glutton for punishment.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
