window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>TILLY</b></p> <p><b>No one ever told me the bugpocalypse would be so lonely. </b></p> <p>I was ready when the man-eating space bugs descended from the skies. I have everything I need in my fortress: food, water, and my dog, Waffles, but I'm bored out of my gourd and lonely AF. So when a Xarc’n warrior breaks into my home, I decide to “detain” my purple intruder. </p> <p>Note to self: Tranquilizer darts and zip ties do not hold big, burly hunters. At all. Now I have more muscley warrior than I know what to do with pressing me up against the counter and claiming I’m his. </p> <p><b>RAYK’N</b></p> <p><b>Captured by a little hunter.</b> </p> <p>Checking up on a kid and his dog is not my idea of fun; I’d rather be out shooting down flyers or hunting for my mate. But Tilly is not a male or a child. Her enticing scent calls to me, and I follow it to her home. </p> <p>When I approach, she shoots me with a tranquilizer. Imagine my surprise when I wake with my wrists tied and her straddling my body. If my mate wants to play, all she has to do is ask. </p> <p><b>This story can be listened to as a stand-alone or as a part of a series. HEA guaranteed!</b></p>";
