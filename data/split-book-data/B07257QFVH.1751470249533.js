window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Clam jam. Definition: the female equivalent of a cock block. Example: You're chatting with a guy you're interested in, and your friend comes along and lays claim to him. </p> <p>Maggie: That's my life - except it's worse. My friend who keeps \"jamming\" me is my gay roommate. </p> <p>Fact: He went home with three - yes, three - of the guys I had been so sure were into me. </p> <p>Fact: He's really pissing me off. I'll never manage to get a boyfriend before the age of 50 if he keeps this up. </p> <p>Fact: Secretly, I wonder what it would be like if he weren't gay. Why do all the hot, sweet, tender-hearted guys have to be gay? </p> <p>Ry: The day I interviewed for the room to rent, everything changed. I knew I had met the girl, except there was one small problem: She'd been burned badly and didn't want to deal with a heterosexual guy as a roommate. I could've found another place to live, but I wanted to live there - with her. So I had to go undercover. </p> <p>Fact: I'm in love with my roommate. </p> <p>Fact: She's going to hate me if I come clean now. </p> <p>Fact: I'm not giving up. Which means I'll just have to continue to run defense until I figure out a way to get Maggie to see the real me. </p> <p>Contains mature themes. </p>";
