window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Eighteen-year-old Haru Ono has been in love with Aiden Davis since he was in middle school. Trying to keep his feelings under wraps is annoyingly hard when they’re living under the same roof, more so since Aiden is so caring and selflessly showers him with kindness.</p> <p>Haru knows family is important to Aiden, who has been shouldering the burden of raising five younger siblings, and it’s best Haru never reveals his feelings to Aiden. Then again, an 18-year-old boy with raging hormones can only bottle up so much until everything starts to burst.</p> <p><b>Haru’s story is a BL (Boys Love, Yaoi, MM) harem romance. The uke (Haru) will gain his hunky alpha men (semes) one at a time as his story progresses.</b></p> <p><b>Haru’s Story (BL Harem):</b></p> <ul> <li><b><i>Haru to Aiden</i></b></li> <li><b><i>Aiden to Haru</i></b></li> <li><b><i>Noah to Haru</i></b></li> <li><b><i>Mason to Haru</i></b></li> </ul>";
