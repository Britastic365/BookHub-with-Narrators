window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>One of the few humans at the palace, Lykke has served the royal family her whole life, enjoying their protection from the fae who hate her kind. Unfortunately, nothing could protect her heart from falling in love with her best friend—the prince. Even if he returned her love, he could never marry a human, let alone a servant. But holding onto her mother’s words that love can conquer all, she refuses to give up, no matter the costs.</p> <p>As the crown prince, Connor is preparing to be king and doing his best to rebuild the king’s armies and neutralize a rebel threat. Tasked with also ensuring his younger brother ends his licentious ways and marries a neighboring princess, he thinks things can’t get any worse—until a human servant, a woman he saved years ago, catches his brother’s eye and threatens to ruin everything.</p> <p>When Lykke finds herself sentenced to death for murdering a fae noble, she’s shocked to see it’s the older brother—Connor—who steps in to save her...and not in the way she expected. In a world jaded by war, where love is weakness, a fae prince finds himself torn between his desire to save his country and his growing love for a human. He can’t save both, but how can he choose between his duty and his heart?</p>";
