And the villain of this tale was my father, the king. When a brutal attack leaves me no choice but to flee, I find myself cast out and alone.</p> <p>Six years later, I’m dragged back to hell as nothing more than a pawn. I’m not the same girl that ran, so I’ll play their game...but not by their rules. Because this time I won’t go down without a fight. It will take more than knights on chrome horses to break me.</p> <p>The princess has returned. And it’s time to take back my crown.</p> <p><b>This book is intended for listeners over the age of 18 due to swearing, violence, and sexy fun times, with not just one biker, but three.</b></p>";
