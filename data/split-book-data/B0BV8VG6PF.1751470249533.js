I fell in love with the wrong person and … I told him.</p> <p>Ryan’s always been with me ever since I can remember. It’s been the two of us—side by side. Through every new beginning, every new \"family\", and every failure. Is it any wonder that the love I had for him turned into something different—something deeper? Something utterly rotten? And is it any wonder that he hates me for it now?</p> <p>Ryan</p> <p>I’m a damaged soul, and she’s the only thing that’s ever held me together. But the one woman I want is the one woman I can never have.</p> <p>She thinks I hate her for her confession, and maybe a part of me does. What I hate more, though, is that I have to push her away to keep her safe. That I have to pretend like I don’t f--king want her when she’s all I’ve been able to think about for the last six years.</p> <p>We’re no f--king Romeo and Juliet. We’re much worse than that. A love like ours was doomed from the start.</p>";
