window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Never trust a dragon—even Jonathan knows that.</b></p> <p>With his peaceful life as a scholar far behind him and his ever-growing mountain of debt to the Department of Taxation hanging over him, Jonathan can't afford to play it safe. If he wants to get his castle back, he'll need to take a few risks. At least he's not facing danger alone.</p> <p>Whether it's his faithful butler, a former paladin, a shapeshifter who might have gotten stuck, a land-loving merman, a wandering werewolf, a huntress in disguise, or a raccoon who can remodel the landscape, Jonathan will have plenty of company as he runs (or is dragged) headlong into danger. And he'll need every bit of help he can get if he wants to make it through their next mission alive.</p> <p>For once, Jonathan isn't the one being rescued. Nope. He and the others have been asked to brave the perils of a legendary dragon's labyrinth to help another vampire prove that love really does conquer all. Or maybe it doesn't when \"all\" includes elementals, zombies, and only the gods know what else. After all, nothing says probable death like a dragon with a smile.</p> <p>Oh well. Jonathan might not be a fan of probable death… but he'll take it over certain death any day of the week.</p>";
