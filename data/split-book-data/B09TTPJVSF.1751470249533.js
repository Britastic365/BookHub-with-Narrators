As they get closer to unraveling the reasons behind Connie’s kidnapping, Connie’s captor grows more threatening and soon Stephanie has no choice but to throw caution to the wind, follow her instincts, and go rogue.</p> <p>Full of surprises, thrills, and humor, <i>Going Rogue</i> reveals a new side of Stephanie Plum, and shows Janet Evanovich at her scorching, riotous best.</p>";
