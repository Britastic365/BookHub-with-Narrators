window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Anvil is a rough, muscled bouncer working in a roadhouse. Sarah is a type-A, risk averse actuarial major with her whole life mapped out.</p> <p>She has a plan. Goals. And none of them include a tattooed, possessive bouncer.</p> <p>She just wanted one night off from being perfect, boring, and careful. The night she steps out to try something out of her comfort zone, sneaking into a bar on the shady side of town, the alpha bouncer steps in to protect her from danger.</p> <p>Danger from everything but him.</p> <p>*Author's confession: I don't even know if this could happen in real life. Luckily, it's a book. That means the hot, tatted, beardy bouncer can totally take one look at the virgin college student studying actuarial science and know he's going to marry the sh*t out of her. Right? *</p> <p>*Anyway - totally safe romance - HEA, no cheating, hero who wouldn't dream of looking at another woman after he sees Sarah. Trust Auntie Brill. It's a crazy story, but it's so much fun.</p>";
