window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Three steam-up-your-holiday listens featuring a single mom Cinderella, two sworn enemies catching a streaking Santa (and the love bug), and a Scrooge-like cowgirl who gets a second chance with the one who got away. </p> <p><i>MILF on the Shelf</i></p> <p>Single mom Maggie has given up on love. And dating. And hope that she’ll meet a man who isn’t better left on the shelf. That is, until her socialite nemesis swears Maggie couldn’t get a date to the Christmas Ball if her life depended on it. Scrambling to find a plus one, Maggie calls in a favor from her childhood friend, Penny. The one who works for a male escort service.</p> <p><i>Up to Snow Good</i></p> <p>The only thing worse than a streaking Santa dashing naked through my Christmas tree farm? Answer: Lawrence Beverly, the insufferable Brit who opened a competing farm down the lane, finding out about it. I loathe Lawrence like cocktail sauce in my cocoa, and there’s no way I’m letting him use Mr. Jingle Balls against me. Luckily, I have a foolproof plan to take care of my Santa problem. Or so I think, until it goes hideously awry and Lawrence sweeps in to save the day. Now we’re making out in front of my fireplace and he’s saying all the right things, but can I trust this man with my heart? Or is he still up to snow good?</p> <p><i>The Twelve Dates of Christmas</i></p> <p>It’s the time of year for miracles. Once upon a time, Lula and Carter were inseparable. But when their romance faltered, the holiday lights went out in Lula’s heart. She gave up on love and embraced a hermit’s existence, until Carter pops back up in Lonesome Point, begging for a second chance. She gives him 12 days - and 12 dates - to make his case before she sends him packing. Soon, however, not even Lula Scrooge can deny she and Carter go together like cocoa and cookies. But when her old fears are reawakened, it may take a holiday miracle to keep them together.</p>";
