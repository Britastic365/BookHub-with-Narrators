window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Nothing brightens up a Monday like finding out you're the spawn of Satan.</p> <p>The big bad is dead and now Satan's spawn must fight for the Morningstar throne. I'm tossed into the ring, whether I want to be there or not.</p> <p>I'm mostly human, a hunter by trade, and totally outmatched by my half siblings. The chance I'll survive these tests and claim the throne is slim. Then someone starts assassinating my siblings. It's only a matter of time until I'm next.</p> <p>I'm not the kind of girl who depends on anyone, but there are four demons who could help me survive this fiasco-a sadistic Nightmare, a psychotic efreet, a charismatic Fallen and Sin, an unhinged monster. Problem is, like all demons, they're absolutely, sinfully tempting.</p> <p>I'm pretty sure they each have their own agenda. I'm also pretty sure one of them is the killer.</p> <p>Let the games begin.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
