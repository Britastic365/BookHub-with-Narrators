window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Orc Mountain needs a midwife, and this devious, deadly orc is determined to find one…</b></p> <p>In a world of recently warring orcs and men, Gwyn Garrett is a lord’s daughter on a mission: to escape her lord father, dump her cheating betrothed, and pursue her true calling as a plant-obsessed midwife—until the night her brand-new house is invaded by an orc.</p> <p>He's a tall, taunting, treacherous monster with sharp teeth, vicious claws, and gleaming black eyes. Worst of all, he has a blatant, brutal mission of his own. He’s come to court her, claim her, compromise her.</p> <p>Gwyn is far too clever to fall for this sneaky orc’s schemes—right? Even if he moves like a graceful god, his voice is sweet syrup in her ears, and his low, mocking laugh sparks something hot and reckless deep in her soul…</p> <p>It’s hunger; it’s home; it’s everything Gwyn never knew she needed. But in its wake, there’s only devastation, defeat, and the realization that she’s forever linked with this horrible orc and his horrible plans—and, with the war, the fates of hundreds of women like her.</p> <p>The truth is that Orc Mountain desperately needs her. Maybe this proud, lonely orc does too…</p>";
