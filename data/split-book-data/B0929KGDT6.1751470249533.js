Still, I helped him track the heir of a powerful werewolf family, and that was a win, but now I don’t know which way is up.</p> <p>My reality has shifted, pun intended. I’m not who I thought I was, and the changes are more than I can handle. As if that wasn’t enough, a new drug is ravaging my city, including the customers at my mate tracking agency. What gives?</p> <p>So as I try to come to terms with my new identity and I hide my new secret from the man I love, the world around me bursts into chaos, and I find myself in the middle of a wide conspiracy where alliances are broken and the things I hold dear and true to my heart turn out to be nothing but lies.</p> <p>Will my secret destroy my change of normalcy and happiness with Jake?</p> <p><b>If you enjoy K.F. Breene, Shannon Mayer, Annette Marie, and CN Crawford, then prepare to enjoy a witty heroine and her rekindling romance with a hot werewolf. And if you shed a few tears, maybe you’ll even get a potion to help track your soul mate.</b></p>";
