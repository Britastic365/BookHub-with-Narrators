window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The Collapse took my rights away. But it’s my heart that will leave me truly powerless. </b> </p> <p>Somehow, I’m still alive. So are the gruff, dangerous men I’ve found myself strangely at home with. The Steel Demons escaped execution only to find they’ve been betrayed by one of their own. Once an unbreakable brotherhood, tension and distrust grows between them. </p> <p>Meanwhile, I’m stuck between a rock and Reaper’s hard place. </p> <p>I should have known better than to fall for the green-eyed, rough-handed president. I <i>knew</i> a man like him would only hurt me. When he drops hints about sharing me with his two best friends, that says enough about what he thinks I am - an object to be passed around, just like every other woman after the Collapse. </p> <p>The only question is, can I find the power to walk away? </p> <p><i>Powerless</i> is the second book in a motorcycle-themed dystopian reverse-harem series. This series is full of steam and dangerous men who take what they want. Proceed with caution if easily offended. </p> <p>Listening order: </p> <p></p> <ol> <li><i>Lawless </i></li> <li><i>Powerless </i></li> <li><i>Fearless</i></li> </ol>";
