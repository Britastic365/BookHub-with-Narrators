window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Once, I’d chosen my mate instead of freedom.</b></p> <p>For weeks, we retraced our steps back to Mistfell and the lingering shadow of the Veil at the boundary between realms. Traveling through the kingdom, I denied the evidence in front of me, unable to fathom that I wasn’t the lost princess of Faerie. Instead, it is Fallon who must fear the consequences of her heritage. Which leaves me with a single, unanswered question.</p> <p>Then, I awoke, caged high above the throne of the Queen of Air &amp; Darkness.</p> <p>Mab is the Queen who keeps all of Alfheimr held squirming within her clawed grasp. She uses the children of Faerie to sustain the magic granted to her by the cursed gem atop her crown, which has carved her from the girl she once was into a dark vessel, obsessed with power. She thrives on cruelty, and wields our love as an instrument for pain.</p> <p>Now, I’ll play the games of the Fae.</p> <p>I’m a curiosity, my presence an enigma that was never foreseen. I may not be Mab’s daughter, yet she still keeps me close, as she forges me into a weapon against humans and Fae alike. Mab may not own me yet, but she controls the life of the man I love. There is nothing I wouldn’t do to see him freed.</p> <p>Even if I have to become the villain to do it.</p> <p><i>What Lurks between the Fates</i> is book three in a series and ends in a cliffhanger. It features content that may be offensive or triggering to some listeners.</p>";
