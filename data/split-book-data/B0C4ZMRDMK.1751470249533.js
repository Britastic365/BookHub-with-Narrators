window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Her Fantasy</i> is a medium gray<b> </b>romance novella with high spice and low plot. If you collect book boyfriends as well, the eerie similarities in this book will make you wonder if someone has been watching you! </p> <p>Fantasies are just daydreams that turn you on.</p> <p>I’m a housewife, married to a man who is the definition of husband material. But sometimes, it doesn’t feel like enough. When I hold a stack of new books, I can’t wait to slip into the fantasy within them. I love living in dark, fictional worlds. Neglecting my wifely duties, I find my pleasure within the pages.</p> <p>I want my husband to be like all my book boyfriends, but I’m too ashamed of what gets me off to tell him what I want, or let him read my books. My real life is wonderful, but my fictional one is sexier.</p> <p>When a party causes my worlds to merge, will my fantasies finally become reality? Will my husband turn out to be my real life book boyfriend?</p> <p><i>Her Fantasy </i>is a dark contemporary anthology-like novella. Darkness levels vary between chapters, and content warnings on Lauren Biel's website should be taken seriously. Pearl clutchers beware—this book will dive into deep, dark fantasies.</p> <p>**Duet narrated**</p>";
