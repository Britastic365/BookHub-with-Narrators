window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Ruthless. Bloodthirsty. Killer. And now? Her husband.</b></p> <p>Ilsevel knows exactly how brutal the fae raiders are. She watched them attack the holy shrine of her god, slaughter the priests, and drag her sister away screaming into the darkness.</p> <p>When she's forced up onto the auction block to be sold off as a warbride to the highest bidder—and when the chilling warlord, Taarthalor, pushes his way to the front of the crowd and lays down an outrageous bid—Ilsevel fears her nightmare is only just beginning.</p> <p>Taar took one look at the fiery little human, and something in him sparked. He cannot explain it. He knows only that he will not see her sold off to one of the soulless monsters trying to outbid each other for a chance to use and discard her soft, womanly flesh. If that means binding himself to her by marriage, so be it.</p> <p>Can this dark king convince his bride not to murder him in his sleep before he can decide what to do with her? Or do the gods have other plans in store for the captive princess and her terrifying new husband?</p> <p>WarBride <i>is book one of a dual point-of-view (his and hers) forced marriage fantasy trilogy with a dangerous, brooding hero, kiss-or-kill vibes, and swift-to-ignite steam that will leave you begging for more. If you love watching a cold-hearted fae warlord discover his one weakness just might be the spitfire princess who drives him crazy, this is the book for you. Perfect for fans of Elise Kova, Laura Thalassa, and Danielle L. Jensen.</i></p>";
