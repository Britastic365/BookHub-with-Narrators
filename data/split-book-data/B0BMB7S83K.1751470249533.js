window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>To protect those who matter most, we will betray others in ways we never expected.</b></p> <p>This is supposed to be a good year. With a new set of instructors—and ones I know well—I'm sure it will be. For once, things are finally starting to go my way. My mentors are proud, my family is closer than ever before, and I am happy.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the gods are tired of waiting. Every day, Zeal grows stronger, but Ambition, Inspiration, Perception, Compassion, and Intuition don't. They're fading, with no hope in sight.</p> <p>Except me.</p> <p>Piece by piece, my god has built me up, given me \"weapons\" to use, and made me into the kind of woman I can be proud of. He calls me his partner and that isn't an empty title. It means more than just serving him. I can tell by the longing in his divine eyes.</p> <p>My success doesn't go unnoticed, though. My haters want to destroy me, but let them try. Petty bullying is too childish for me to worry about. With so many priests able to see the God of Temptation now, I no longer care who likes me and who doesn't.</p> <p>And that's my biggest mistake.</p> <p>Because my god doesn't run this temple. He doesn't make the rules. With a single signed paper, I'm no longer as safe as I thought. Friends are going to be betrayed. Lovers will suffer. Somehow, I have to fix this.</p> <p>I am the Priestess of Temptation, Zeal's chosen. Someone is going to be punished. I almost hope it's me.</p> <p>The Path of Temptation series features a strong woman and the men who love her. Graphic language, adult situations, and potentially triggering violence that are suitable for a mature audience are included. This is a love story, but sometimes love comes with a price. Possible triggers include discussions of rape and assault, domestic violence, bullying, harassment, consensual pain and battery, shaming, sexual sadism, minor violence, and more adult themes.</p>";
