window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"<i>***First published in Kindle Vella***</i><br> <br> <b>She's a wolf-shifting scientist who needs cover, and He’s an alpha without a pack… </b><br> <br> As the only living wolf pack member with the tiniest drop of alpha blood in her veins, Luna McElhanney should be happy. Instead, she just wants to be left alone in her lab with her experiments, until she discovers something that could end them all. In a heartbeat, she goes from living under the radar to the one being hunted. There’s only one solution, according to the pack, and that’s for her to mate Erik Volk and bring him into the fold.<br> <br> Erik Volk has been fascinated by the petite wolf shifter from the moment he’d kidnapped her so she could help his family, which she cheerfully did. He enjoys his job as the Enforcer for his brother’s pack, but the Alpha in him keeps yanking against the chains. When he discovers Luna is in danger, as is his new pack, he has no choice but to let the Alpha loose and become the Shifter they should all fear.</p>";
