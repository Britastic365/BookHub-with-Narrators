window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Every little girl dreams of the fairy tale. The one where the white knight rushes in to save her from the clutches of evil. They fall in love, have babies, and live happily ever after.</p> <p>By that definition, my life should have been a fairy tale, too.</p> <p>When I was eight years old, Caven Hunt saved me from the worst kind of evil to walk the Earth. It didn’t matter that I was a kid. I fell in love with him all the same.</p> <p>But that was where my fairy tale ended.</p> <p>Years later, a one-night stand during the darkest time imaginable gave us a little girl. It was nothing compared to the pitch black that consumed me when I was forced to leave her with Caven for good.</p> <p>At the end of every fairy tale, the happily ever after is the one thing that remains consistent. It wasn’t going to be mine, but there hadn’t been a night that passed where I hadn’t prayed that it would be hers.</p> <p>I owed Caven my life.</p> <p>However, I owed that innocent child more.</p> <p>And that included ripping the heart from my chest and facing her father again.</p>";
