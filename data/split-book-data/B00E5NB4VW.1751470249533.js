window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Eden Black walks among humans, protecting them from the murderous evil of other-worlders who abduct and enslave. And though she appears to be human herself, Eden is an alien, a Raka, distinguished by her golden hair and skin, and gifted with the ominous ability to kill without remorse - and with total accuracy. That is, until the fateful night she has one shot to eliminate her target, a human slaver - and misses. </p> <p>\"Failure\" is not in Eden's vocabulary. Neither is \"partner\" - but that's what she is forcibly assigned after recovering from her disastrous mission. A sexy, steely-nerved human agent, Lucius Adaire enjoys nothing more than sparking the fury - and rousing the desire - of the fiery female assassin too proud to admit defeat. Locked in an assignment they cannot afford to lose, Lucius and Eden find themselves bound in two high-stakes, heart-pounding games: the sensual web of kill or be killed, and the erotic dance of seduction.</p>";
