window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Devyn is a warrior, and an unrepentant collector of women, able to charm anyone. Anyone except Bride McKells. Uneducated in the ways of the vampire, Bride is not even sure if other vampires exist. Seductive Devyn has the answers she craves, and he can take her to the dark underground of her people. But Bride’s blood might hold the key to saving Devyn’s friends, so he’s loath to let her go. Especially when he begins to crave her more than he’s ever craved another. Together they enter the seedy world of slave auctions, battle a powerful alien queen whose diseased blood turns humans into cannibals, and discover a passion unlike any other. But in the end, Bride must choose between the man she’s come to love and the family she’s always longed for.</p>";
