window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"We're the D'Artigo sisters: sexy, savvy ex-operatives for the Otherworld Intelligence Agency. But being half-human, half-Fae means our powers could go haywire at any time—mostly the wrong times. My sister Camille is a wicked-good witch with three sexy husbands. My sister Menolly is a vampire who's dating a werepuma. And me? I'm Delilah, a two-faced werecat and Death Maiden. I watch over things in the Super Community, where trouble is about to go down hard. </p> <p>It's Valentine's Day and the D'Artigo women are preparing for their friend Iris's wedding. But when Delilah and her sisters get word that the Super Community Center has been bombed, things get really ugly. The evil coyote shifters—the Koyami—are back, and Newkirk, their new leader, has joined forces with a group of rogue sorcerers. Then, just when it seems things can't get worse, the demon lord Shadow Wing sends in a new front man, and life really goes to hell.\"</p>";
