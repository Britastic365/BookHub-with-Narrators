window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the depths of Blackwell Keep, the fragments of Draeken discovered the truth of their shattered soul. One among them is the fragment of Power. Malevolent and supreme, he has lurked within Draeken for ages, preparing for his ultimate ascendancy. Now, he seeks four mighty generals so he can unleash Serak’s limitless army. If he obtains his desire, his reign will be eternal.</p> <p>Weakened and outmatched, the fragments are not without allies. Assassins and queens, dakorians and Eternals, all stand united against Draeken’s invasion. Gathering under a single banner, the people follow a desperate plan to end the war - before it consumes every kingdom and race. As the final battle looms, Elenyr will stop at nothing to protect her sons, even if it means a journey into the teeth of the enemy. In a war of ancient guardians, dragons, and titans, the bond of brotherhood will prove its might, for Draeken has his fiends, but Elenyr has her family.</p> <p>The Great Draeken War has begun.</p>";
