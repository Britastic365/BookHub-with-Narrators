window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Callum Hunt's summer break isn't like other kids'. His closest companion is a Chaos-ridden wolf, Havoc. His father suspects him of being secretly evil. And, of course, most kids aren't heading back to the magical world of the Magisterium in the fall. </p> <p>It's not easy for Call...and it gets even harder after he checks out his basement and discovers that his dad might be trying to destroy both him and Havoc. </p> <p>Call escapes to the Magisterium - but things only intensify there. The Alkahest - a copper gauntlet capable of separating certain magicians from their magic - has been stolen. And in their search to discover the culprit, Call and his friends, Aaron and Tamara, awaken the attention of some very dangerous foes - and get closer to an even more dangerous truth. </p> <p>As the mysteries of the Magisterium deepen and widen, best-selling authors Holly Black and Cassandra Clare take listeners on an extraordinary journey through one boy's conflict - and a whole world's fate.</p>";
