window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A first kiss that changed everything. </p><p>Killian Kane. He was the most feared guy in high school. Guarded. Angry. A fighter. But when I caught him watching me with his captivating green eyes, I saw something more. Something protective and kind. He warned me to stay away from him. I did. Until I didn't, and he kissed me. A knee-weakening, body-tingling kiss that left me breathless. And scared the hell out of me. And then...he warned me never to come near him again, or next time he wouldn't let me go. </p><p>That was 11 years ago. We aren't teenagers anymore. He has probably forgotten me. He's a famous rock star now. I'm a dance instructor with a broken dream and desperate for a job. So, when we cross paths again I don't expect him to remember me. He does. And his warning 11 years ago? I'm about to find out exactly what that meant. </p>";
