You may also be asking why I agreed to be a designer’s apprentice with no intelligible sewing skills.</p> <p>Cake.</p> <p>Delicious, fluffy, flour-laden, sugary cake—the beginning of my downfall.</p> <p>If it weren’t for that cake, I’d have never bribed Mai Sakamoto for more. We’d have never developed a friendship. I wouldn’t know of her dreams to become a fashion designer. And I’d sure as hell would never have ended up on a reality TV show to help her chase those dreams.</p> <p>Real knight in shining armor moves, right?</p> <p>Our friendship was a match made in heaven… before the show put us up in a one-bed hotel room.</p> <p>Now my lines are blurry and I can’t help but wonder, could Mai be my perfect fit?</p> <p><b>MAI</b></p> <p>Every day I’m battling imposter syndrome, anxiety, and abject terror—and why?</p> <p>Is it for prize money? Fame? The opportunity for my designs to be seen around the world?</p> <p>Nope.</p> <p>It’s because of Theo. Beautiful, hilarious, frustrating Theo.</p> <p>Theodore Garrett believes in me. He believes I’ve got what it takes to win this crazy competition. He quiets the doubts in my head, pushing me toward my dream life.</p> <p>Only, I don’t know how to tell him that my dreams don’t include fashion shows and exclusive lines, and instead feature… him.</p> <p>Darn Knit All.</p> <p>Narrated by Natalie Naudus &amp; Liam DiCosimo</p>";
