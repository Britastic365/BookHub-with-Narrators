window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the latest story of the Elder Races, two mates face their deadliest challenge yet-each other…</p> <p>Pia and Dragos's magical young son Liam (the Peanut), is growing at an unprecedented rate, and if that isn't enough, he is also exhibiting new, and unpredictable, magical gifts. To protect him, the concerned parents decide to move to upstate New York. Both Dragos and Pia relish the idea of leaving behind the city. They finally have the space to indulge their Wyr side, and Liam can grow in safety. It's a breath of fresh air-literally-but their idyllic situation is shattered when Dragos is injured in a freak accident. Stripped of his memory and bereft of Pia's taming influence, there's nothing holding back Dragos's darkest side. And in order to restore her family and save her mate, Pia must confront the most powerful menace in Elder Races history. It's going to take more than a penny to fix this…</p>";
