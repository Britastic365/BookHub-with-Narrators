The stories I’ve heard about the way they rule their underworld are enough to make my heart race. But those rumors have nothing on the truth.</p> <p>Danny, Church, Frank. The three men who own me now. The head of this so-called kingdom and the two savages who enforce his wrath.</p> <p>They made a peace deal with my family, which came at a cost—me. A mafia princess gifted to them as a bride.</p> <p>So here I am in my white dress with a gun to my head and a knife in my garter.</p> <p>I won’t become their plaything. I won’t become their prize.</p> <p>The war between our families might have ended with this union, but I’m starting a battle of my own. And I’ll trade my body for a chance to leave this wedded bliss behind.</p> <p>The only question left is whether they’ll be the ones bleeding out, or if I’ll end up with my heart torn from my chest and fed to these hungry British dogs. </p> <p><b>This is a dark mafia romance where the main character will end up with more than one love interest and is part of a series of stand-alone books, Mafia Wars.</b></p>";
