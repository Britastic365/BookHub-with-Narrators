window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Three possessive wolf-shifters. A wounded woman finding her strength. A world of dangerous fae determined to exploit her unexpected powers.</b></p> <p>For years, the monsters who killed my family have held me in a cage. Brutalized and half-starved. Only kept alive so they can steal my blood.</p> <p>Until one evening, when three eerily gorgeous men rescue me.</p> <p>They offer a safe haven under their protection with everything I need to heal. I'm not used to this kindnessâ€”or the desires their smoldering eyes and strong hands stir in my body and my heart.</p> <p>But these fearsome men aren't really men. Like my former captors, they're fae who can shift into wolves. A curse gripping the faerie realm turns them wild under the full moon.</p> <p>Only the strange power coursing through my veins can cure their rage.</p> <p>I'm a prize as much as a person to them. But I've survived this long without giving up. And as I recover my strength, I'm winning their hearts as well.</p> <p>Can this damaged human hold her own among the savage fae?</p> <p><i>Bound to the Fae </i>is a fantasy romance series featuring possessive shifters, dangerous fae politics, and a wounded heroine coming into her own. This audiobook set contains the first three books in the series: <i>Captive of Wolves</i>, <i>Feral Blood</i>, and <i>Kings of Moonlight</i>.</p>";
