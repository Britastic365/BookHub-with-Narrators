There were days when I did not like you at all, but you were the man standing at the end of the aisle with the snow falling around us whenever I dared to dream. Now we are here, at our wedding in Connecticut, on Christmas Day. The setting is perfect, and I cannot wait to spend the rest of my life with you. -Jade Estelle Lassiter</p> <p>It took you knocking me on my ass to realize you were always the one. We met as young adults and thought we knew everything only to learn there was so much more to discover. As I watched you from afar you grew into the one woman I could not live without. On this day, I will make you my wife. As we embark on this day, I thank God for bringing you back into my life at a time when I was wise enough to grab you and never let you go. My heart, my mind, my bodyâ€”the very soul of me is yours forever and always. -Blake Everett Thornton</p> <p>Those Lassiters have been a thorn in my side. This wedding will only take place over my dead body. -Sofia Thornton</p> <p>Your wish is my command. Kill her. -Anonymous</p>";
