window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Set against the atmospheric snowy backdrop of the rural Pacific Northwest, New York Times bestselling author Rebecca Zanetti's edgy, gripping thriller will have listeners guessing until the very end.</p> <p>Men are dying in the Pacific Northwest, their bodies found near churches, charities, and counseling centers—each with valentine candy hearts shoved down their throats. They're good men with families and community ties—or so they seem until FBI profiler Laurel Snow and her team begin to investigate. Then the case takes a shockingly personal turn when the father she's never met, a former pastor, turns up among the dead.</p> <p>Now, besides solving her father's murder, Laurel is on the hunt to discover the truth of his past. Complicating things is Laurel's troubled half-sister, Abigail, a brilliant sociopath determined to prove that they've both inherited their father's malignant narcissism.</p> <p>Assisting Laurel is Washington Fish and Wildlife Captain Huck Rivers, a dangerous loner whose reliance on gut instinct puts him at odds with Laurel's coolly analytic approach. But the choice may be moot when the killer hones in on Huck's own dark secrets—putting him and Laurel squarely in the crosshairs.</p>";
