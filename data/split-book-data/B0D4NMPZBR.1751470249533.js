window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When the unexpected death of a coven member brings all the witches in Honeysuckle Springs together, Evie finally meets her witchy counterparts. Some she knew were magical, but others surprise her. But what really disturbs her is a murderer may lurk amongst them.</p> <p>The coven isn't the only thing in turmoil. The wild kiss Evie shared with Caden didn't just unlock a few of her stolen memories. It paved the way to possibly remembering everything about that long ago fateful summer. The only problem is kissing him often enough to retrieve those memories could put their hearts in danger . . . if they aren't already.</p> <p>Evie soon realizes witchcraft is the only thing that will fix her relationship with Caden and help her solve the murder. Unfortunately, Aunt Birdie's still dragging her feet, unwilling to teach her much, which leaves Evie no choice but to strike out on her own. If she starts with a few simple spells, surely, nothing could go wrong . . .</p>";
