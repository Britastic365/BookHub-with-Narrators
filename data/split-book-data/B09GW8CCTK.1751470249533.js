In an, it’ll ruin your career, kind of way.</p> <p>Only, Laric didn’t know that he was internet famous.</p> <p>Not until a black-haired beauty walks into his life, and stumbles over every word that she says because all she can picture is him doing the unthinkable for the world to see.</p> <p>Sadly, that’s not the only thing wrong in his life. His world is messed up, and he likes it that way.</p> <p>There’s no room for a woman that wants to fix him.</p> <p>Because fixing requires intimacy, and intimacy isn’t something that Laric does. Not after the life that he’s lived, and the things he’s done to survive. Oh, and let’s not forget the fact that he’s a felon, and he has no regrets about how he got that title.</p> <p>The last thing he needs in his life is a woman that has her head in the clouds and thinks this world is made of butterflies and confetti.</p> <p>However, Catori isn’t who she seems.</p> <p>The day she meets tall, dark, and handsome, he saves her life. And then never leaves - though not for his lack of trying.</p> <p>Not that she’s complaining about the way they’re thrown together, time after time. She’s more than willing to have a man like Laric around. Mostly because she’s already seen the good in him that he refuses to admit that’s there.</p> <p>He may be a biker that does questionable things, but in her heart, she knows that he does those bad things for good reasons. And she’s not about to throw away the chance at happiness just because he thinks he knows what’s best for her.</p> <p>Plot twist: She knows what’s best for her. And that’s him.</p>";
