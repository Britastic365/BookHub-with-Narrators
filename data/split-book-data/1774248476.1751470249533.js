A woman on the run, Maya had no business befriending anyone, let alone allowing herself to become involved with a man...especially after her last experience. Even so, she couldn’t help but become obsessed with the bruised, battered, and beautiful killer who walked into her life. </p> <p>Grady Cain reached rock bottom. His past finally caught up with him, causing him to lose his edge at work and in life. Spiraling down a desperate path of remorse and guilt, Grady wasn’t expecting his refuge to come in the form of a woman. Day in, day out, she was the only thing he’d allowed himself to think about. To focus on. To consume him. </p> <p>One was running. The other had nothing to run to. Until these troubled souls crossed paths...and two paths became one. </p> <p><i>The Killers series is intended for mature listeners.</i></p>";
