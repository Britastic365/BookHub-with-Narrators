window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>This box set contains the first three stories set in the Danger Universe and is filled with deadly magic, non-stop action, and irresistible romance.</b><br> <br> <br> <b><i>Hint of Danger</i></b><br> <br> Lina wants the one thing a ghost can’t have. To be touched. When she’s given the opportunity to rejoin the world of the living and experience exactly that, the muscle-bound immortal warrior with icy blue eyes is just what the doctor ordered.<br> But while fate may have granted her a second chance at life, unraveling the mystery of who—and what—she used to be is the only thing standing between her and happily ever after.<br> <br> <br> <b><i>Face of Danger</i></b><br> <br> Hunted by her murderer, wanted by the Brotherhood, and struggling to remaster her powers, Lina will need to put everything on the line to reclaim her life. Failure isn't an option. Because losing means forfeiting the one thing she holds above everything else.<br> Nord.<br> <br> <br> <b><i>World of Danger</i></b><br> <br> Nord and Lina may have dealt with her murderer, but along the way they also managed to make lots of new enemies. Now the Drakes, the Brotherhood, and even the mysterious King of the Underground all want a piece of them.<br> One unhappy supernatural order they could probably handle. All of them at the same time . . . not so much.<br> But where do you go when there’s nowhere left to hide?<br> <br> <br> <b>Undercover Magic Volume 1 is the first set of books in the Undercover Magic series, a steamy and suspenseful paranormal romance following a ghost and a berserker's chance meeting at The Monster Ball. Thankfully, the ball was just the beginning for these two fated lovers. So if you adore overprotective, ax-wielding heroes, smoldering sexual tension, supernatural secret societies, and loads of banter, you’ve just found your next listen!</b></p>";
