And me, Rose, their muse. The one.</p> <p>Together they cracked open my heart, they made me feel. Our love story isn't made up of fairy tales. It's dark, twisted, but, oh, so beautiful. And no one, not even the woman who tried to kill me, is going to destroy what we have.</p> <p>This is our final story, this is our symphony. Are you ready to listen?</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
