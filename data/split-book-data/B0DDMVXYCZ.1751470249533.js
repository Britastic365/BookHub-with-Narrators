It's usually something small—the way he puts ice in his cup, drinks his coffee, or his preferred name in the bedroom, but it's enough to make her realize she could never spend an eternity with him.</p> <p>Theodore is ready to take over the company his father left for him. He's spent his entire life working towards the moment he becomes president, every waking moment dedicated to that goal. Unfortunately, his family man boss isn't too keen on his strictly single ways and worries if he gets this job, he'll never start a family. That's when he lies and tells his boss he has a fiancé.</p> <p>Now, he not only has to prove he deserves the job, despite his rival doing everything he can to sabotage him, but he has to find himself a fiancé—and fast.</p> <p>It's good that his sunshine assistant has an open schedule and can promise a no-strings deal. Seven dates to impress his boss and take down his rival with zero risk that she'll fall for him.</p> <p>But what if this is the one time the ick factor fails her?</p>";
