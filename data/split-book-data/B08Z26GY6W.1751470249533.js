window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Growing up in Emerald Lakes, population 682, had been safe and comfortable. Running my own magic shop and making a living off my green witchcraft, I have no complaints. Sure, there’s my ex, who never understood the word \"no\", but there’s also the lovable and eccentric townspeople who feel more like one huge extended family, and let’s not forget my boy-crazed Gran who keeps us all on our toes. </p> <p>...but something has apparently been missing, and the stars take it upon themselves to correct the problem, dropping four sexy men at my door. Well, not literally. They move into the apartment above my shop, so I’m their landlord. Drawn in by these mages who blew into town on a work assignment, a whole different kind of magic starts to grow between us, but my powers are doing things they shouldn’t, and there’s also a pesky prophecy to unravel. </p> <p>Strange, unnatural things are brewing in Emerald Lakes, and I can’t ignore the sinking suspicion that something life-changing is headed my way. </p> <p>Discovering a whole new world of magic, I can only hope I don’t lose myself in the madness. </p> <p><i>This is a full-length reverse harem romance novel. It contains MMFMM content. It ends on a cliffhanger and contains brief references to domestic violence and other themes that listeners may find triggering.</i></p>";
