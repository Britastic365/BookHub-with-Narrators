But now, so are my nightmares.</p> <p>There’s a new monster in town, and no one knows how to kill it or where it came from. It lurks in the shadows, preying on our every move. For some reason, it seems to be targeting me.</p> <p>I desperately need Tennessee’s help. Only he is strong enough to train me. My magic is too wild and unpredictable to fight this demon by myself.
