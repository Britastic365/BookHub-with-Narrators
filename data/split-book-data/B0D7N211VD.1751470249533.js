I’m strong enough to fight at his side and face the wrath of our enemies, but some dark plot is brewing in the city, and I fear what’s coming.<br> <br> Because it feels like an unforgiving storm.<br> <br> Callie:<br> My sister is lost, and I don’t know if we will ever be whole again. Will she love me as she once had, or will her newfound hunger be the death of us?<br> <br> Though I’ve reclaimed my freedom, the taste of it is bittersweet. Because without my twin, nothing feels right.<br> <br> And even though I can finally claim the man my soul aches for, I’m afraid of the darkness seeping into my life.<br> <br> The threat of gods and monsters is mounting upon us by the hour, and time is running out to save us all.</p> <p>***This is a dark, fantasy romance series by the authors of Zodiac Academy with all the enemies to lovers vibes – don’t go expecting a sweet vampire with sparkling skin and a tendency to watch you sleeping. These vampires are savage and bloodthirsty, and the slayer who hunts them will stab first and ask questions later. This war-torn fantasy world is a brutal bi*ch and only those 18+ have a chance at surviving the darkness lurking in this book. There’s no well-meaning vampires snacking on Bambies instead of babies, and if they get their teeth into you, you’ll be damn lucky to escape with your life and panties intact. So grab hold of your slayer blade (wooden stakes have too many splinters) and get ready to defy the gods, because this is going to be one helluva ride***</p>";
