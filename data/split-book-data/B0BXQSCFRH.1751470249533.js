window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>If you like intrigue, men determined to possess their women, and the strong intelligent women who stand up to them, then you'll love Delta James' newest paranormal romance.</p> <p>In the dark mists of time, the empire was torn apart by men who valued power over principle. An ancient goddess of courage and honor called upon four great wildcats to become her familiars and impose order on the war-torn realm. Gifting each of them with the ability to shift from beast to man and back again, she dispatched them to the four kingdomsâ€”Ireland, Scotland, England and Wales. Each became a warlord and formed the Syndicate to restore all that had been lost.</p> <p>Includes</p> <p><i>The Bargain<br> The Pact<br> The Agreement<br> The Understanding</i></p>";
