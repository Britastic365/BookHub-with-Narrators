window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Careful what you ask for, because Lucifer sees you when you’re sleeping. Spies when you’re awake. Knows if you’ve been nauseatingly good, so try to be bad for the devil’s sake. </i></p> <p>Merry is determined to make Christmas special for her son. He hasn’t spoken or smiled since his father died, so she writes a letter hoping for a holiday miracle.</p> <p>Dear Satan....</p> <p>Her unfortunate error ensures her wish ends up in the wrong place. Worse? Satan answers her plea - after telling Santa where he can shove a candy cane. The devil knows just what Merry needs, and he has the perfect demon for the job.</p> <p>Marduke’s mission is to deliver a hellhound puppy to a little boy, along with some tips on how to avoid getting eaten. What the devil’s kennel master doesn’t expect on this emasculating mission of kindness is Merry. A happy, optimistic woman despite all the strife in her life. It’s disgusting. Annoying. Tempting?</p> <p>Usually, Marduke is all about destroying hopes and dreams - and letting his dogs pee on people while they’re down - but there’s something about Merry....</p>";
