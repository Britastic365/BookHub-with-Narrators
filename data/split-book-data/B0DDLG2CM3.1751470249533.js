window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It begins with a rumor. It ends with a war.</p> <p>After twelve years lost in deep space, Siena has returned to find her friends surrounded by enemies—and an assassin at her back. She may be the supreme augment, but she will not survive without allies. While Reklin infiltrates a prison planet, and Ero tries to save his disloyal brother, Siena is left with a dangerous collection of outlaw clans. To keep them united, she desperately needs a common threat, and finds it in a rumor of missing Imperial grunts.</p> <p>Buried beneath whispers of strange soldiers and lost starships lies a classified government program, one that’s using augment technology for a dark purpose. To prove it, Siena will have to steal the evidence from Genysium, a fortified planet where the Empire hides its most dangerous secrets. But not even Siena is prepared for the explosive truth, that missing recruits is just the beginning…</p> <p>Book 2 of a Military Space Opera series from Ben Hale, #1 Amazon bestselling author of The Augmented. It's perfect for lovers of both Star Wars and Star Trek, as well as fans of authors such as Chris Fox, J.N. Chaney, and Lindsay Buroker.</p>";
