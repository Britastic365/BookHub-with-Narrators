window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Orphans. Changelings. Princesses. Queens.</b></p> <p>We are all and nothing now, our fate weighed on the scales of the stars and counterbalanced by the forces that oppose us.</p> <p>The shadow of the false king spreads as thick as oil across the kingdom we were born to rule, and none remain untouched by its darkness.</p> <p>Our crowns lay within reach if only we can claim them. All souls are at risk now and when the final battle dawns, a new regime will rise. </p> <p>The time for the true reckoning is upon us and we have proven ourselves as savage as our father, as brutal as our mother, and as wild as the Elements which roar through our veins. We can only hope it is enough.</p> <p>When the last sword strikes the final death in this game of fate and fortune, only one side will be victorious. The Starfall Legion charges at first light. And our destiny rides upon our shoulders as we rush into the end.</p> <p>All hail the True Queens. May our rule last longer than this night.</p> <p><i>***This is a dark fantasy romance–don’t go expecting a sweet school for magic with friends around every corner. Fae fight for everything they own and Zodiac Academy is a cutthroat school for students aged 18+ where only the strongest prevail. There’s no Dumbledore here to save anyone’s ass and Lionel Acrux will give Voldemort a run for his money in the evil dictator category. So hold onto your stardust (broomsticks not required) and get ready for a bumpy ride***</i></p>";
