Grappling with explosive powers that begin to emerge, Kyleigh stumbles into a stranger—a woman with glowing eyes who claims she can help.<br> <br> Since Aislin discovered her gift, she’s been nothing more than a weapon—one wielded by criminals. The idea of freedom has always been just that, an idea. A luxury for those who don’t possess her talent for delivering a swift and merciful death. But for the first time, she’s given a shot at the freedom she’s craved for years.<br> <br> The catch? She must use her gifts one final time to carry out a mission fueled by revenge against the man least deserving of her mercy.<br> <br> When Kyleigh and Aislin’s stories become entangled, the two women from worlds apart must find a way to join forces against a vengeful king or risk remaining pawns in a deadly game played by those in power.<br> <br> <i>The Blaze Legacy</i> is a NA/Adult Dark Portal Romantasy series containing content best suited for listeners over the age of 18.</p>";
