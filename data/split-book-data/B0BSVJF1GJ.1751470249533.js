Or at least he is until the curse plaguing him and his vampires turns them all into feral bloodsuckers.</p> <p>Time is running out. Rhys thinks only Emery can break the curse. She’d tell him to buzz off if every time he was near, her body didn’t turn electric with desire. Rhys has money, power, and a face to die for, but he only has eyes for Emery.

Or is it Emery that needs saving?<br> <br> <i>In A Dark Vampire Curse you can expect lots of should-I-shouldn't-I tension between the main characters and plenty of snark, sass and diehard loyalty between the members of this powerful vampire family.
