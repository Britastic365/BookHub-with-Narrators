window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After 19-year-old Jenny Monroe is caught stealing from the home of a powerful politician, she is sent to a special prison in deep space to be trained for her future role as an alien's bride. </p> <p>Despite the public bare-bottom spanking she receives upon her arrival at the detention center, Jenny remains defiant, and, before long, she earns herself a trip to the notorious medical wing of the facility. Once there, Jenny quickly discovers that a sore bottom will now be the least of her worries, and soon enough she is naked, restrained, and shamefully on display as three stern, handsome alien doctors examine and correct her in the most humiliating ways imaginable. </p> <p>The doctors are experts in the treatment of naughty young women, and as Jenny is brought ever closer to the edge of a shattering climax only to be denied again and again, she finds herself begging to be taken in any way they please. But will her captors be content to give Jenny up once her punishment is over, or will they decide to make her their own and master her completely? </p> <p><b>Publisher's Note:</b> <i>Her Alien Doctors</i> is the second book in the Captive Brides series. It includes spankings and sexual scenes. If such material offends you, please don't buy this audiobook. </p>";
