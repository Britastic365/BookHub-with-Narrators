window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>It was love at first bite, in the third book of Lynsay Sands bestselling Argeneau Vampire series.</b></p> <p><b>“[Sands’s] trademark humor and genuine characters…keep her series fresh and her readers hooked.”</b></p> <p><b>—</b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b></p> <p><b>SWM</b>—\"Lucern.\" Successful biographer of family, books recently categorized as \"paranormal romance.\" Something of a recluse. Hates crowds, aggressive women. Doesn't like sunbathing, garlicky dinners or religious symbols. Likes old-fashioned values; spicy Mexican dishes; warm, nice-smelling neck; and plump red lips. Stronger than ten men and can vanish in the blink of an eye. Currently unaware he's seeking a woman to share eternity with.</p> <p><b>SWF</b>—\"Kate C. Leever.\" Newest editor of Romance at Roundhouse Publishing. Perky, fun. Has recently discovered a legacy author just dying to be broken out. In fact, her career could take off from it. (The tall, dark, handsome writer just needs to be taken to several romance conventions and introduced to his fans...and stopped from acting so strange in public.) Dislikes \"difficult, rude, obnoxious, pig-headed writers.\" Currently unaware she's met the man of her wildest dreams.</p> <p><b>Will this be a match for all eternity?</b></p>";
