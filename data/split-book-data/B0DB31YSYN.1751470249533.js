window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Chicago Racketeers Book Three</p> <p>So falling in love with three hot guys all at the same time is a lot of fun. Obviously.</p> <p>Moving in together with all of them? That’s even better. Hot sex every night, with three men who worship the ground you walk on. Trust me, that’s amazing. I’d-probably-give-up-cookies-for-this amazing. And best of all…my men would never make me give up cookies.</p> <p>But that’s also a lot of personality under one roof. A cocky hockey star, a bossy billionaire, and a doctor who gives off big daddy energy do not all want the same things at the same time. From furniture to what’s for dinner to the future, they all have different needs.</p> <p>Now I’ve got to figure out how to get these guys all on the same page with me before it all gets pucked up…</p> <p>Dani, Nathan, Michael, and Crew are back in another steamy, why-choose rom com! No cheating, a guaranteed HEA, and the guys are all about her!</p>";
