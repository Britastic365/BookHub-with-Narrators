One evening, an argument at a ball turns into a serious wager: Jeremy will marry within the year or Diana will forfeit 100 pounds. So shortly after, just before a fortnight-long house party at Elderwild, Jeremy’s country estate, Diana is shocked when Jeremy appears at her home with a very different kind of proposition.</p> <p>After his latest mistress unfavorably criticized his skills in the bedroom, Jeremy is looking for reassurance, so he has gone to the only woman he trusts to be totally truthful. He suggests that they embark on a brief affair while at the house party — Jeremy can receive an honest critique of his bedroom skills and widowed Diana can use the gossip to signal to other gentlemen that she is interested in taking a lover.</p> <p>Diana thinks taking him up on his counter-proposal can only help her win her wager. With her in the bedroom and Jeremy’s marriage-minded grandmother, the formidable Dowager Marchioness of Willingham, helping to find suitable matches among the eligible ladies at Elderwild, Diana is confident her victory is assured. But while they’re focused on winning wagers, they stand to lose their own hearts.</p> <p>With Martha Waters’s signature “cheeky charm and wonderfully wry wit” (<i>Booklist</i>, starred review), <i>To Love and to Loathe</i> is another clever and delightful historical rom-com that is perfect for fans of Christina Lauren and Evie Dunmore.</p>";
