window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Be careful when you wish upon the stars, Baby Doll.</b></p> <p>All I wanted was to go to a good college and finally get my life started. Maybe meet someone, get my degree, and do something I'm passionate about.</p> <p>I just wish someone had told me that my physics professor could feed on my emotions and desires, the guy who sits next to me in astrology club would be hiding his fangs, and my first friend would have a secret of his own. An incubus and a vampire should have been manageable—up until their bloodlines were mixed with an unpredictable race of Zodiac Shifters.</p> <p>I'm human. I'm not part of their cursed astrology. The stars do not rule my life. I didn't even know these things were real until last week. But it's hard to argue with reality when an encounter on the night of the full moon left me as not such a Virgo anymore.</p> <p>I don't know why Marcus, Adrian, and Ceto have all set their sights on me, but just because they're vicious and powerful, doesn't mean I'll be letting them get their way.</p> <p>Zodiac Hybrids <i>is a paranormal dark academia romance set in a college where supernatural creatures hide in plain sight. You'll love it if you enjoy mixing the principles of horoscopes and astrology in your romance, and you prefer your enemies-to-lovers, student/teacher, and monster romances with a mix of self-discovery and possessive, morally gray men who decided that no one else can have their very, very good girl.</i></p>";
