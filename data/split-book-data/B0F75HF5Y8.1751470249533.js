window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A woman rediscovering herself…</b></p> <p>After my husband left, all I wanted was to find myself again. Turns out that's a lot easier said than done when my chronic pain has me canceling plans and everything I try reminds me of my inadequacies.</p> <p>Things only get worse when my attempt at exploring submission is a total disaster. But hope comes in the form of my stoic, stunning vampire friend, Blair. She offers to teach me, giving me a space to safely explore a side of myself I've kept locked away.</p> <p>It's meant to be platonic. Just one friend helping another. So then why can't I stop imagining what it would be like to take things further?</p> <p><b>A vampire losing control…</b></p> <p>I've spent the past ten years building a life where I'm in control. I swore I'd never go back to being the pathetic, emotional girl I was before I was turned.</p> <p>Then Grace showed up.</p> <p>I knew from the moment we met she'd be a problem. My monster craves her in a way that terrifies me, and her humor and beauty pierce through the cracks in my carefully crafted, cold facade. Yet keeping my distance would ruin one of the few friendships I have.</p> <p>How do I shore up the crumbling barriers around my heart before I end up more broken and alone than I was the night I became a vampire?</p> <p>Afterglow <i>is a spicy, slow-burn, sapphic romance featuring a jaded, lonely vampire FMC and a bubbly, anxious human FMC. It is book two in the Monsters of Moonvale series but can be enjoyed as a standalone.</i></p>";
