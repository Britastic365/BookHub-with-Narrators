window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>You can’t bargain with death if you’ve already sold your soul.</b><br> </p> <p>Special agent Patrick Collins has been reassigned by the supernatural operations agency to New York City. Navigating his new relationship with Jonothon de Vere, the werewolf he’s now soulbound to, is nothing compared to dealing with territorial disputes between the vampires and werecreatures who call the five boroughs home. But the delicate treaties that have kept the preternatural world in check are fraying at the edges, and the fallout is spilling into the mundane world.<br> </p> <p>Manhattan’s club scene is overrun with the vampire drug known as shine and the subways have become a dumping ground for bodies. When the dead are revealed as missing werecreatures, Patrick and Jono find themselves entangled in pack politics twisted by vampire machinations.<br> </p> <p>Learning to trust each other comes with problems for both of them, and the gods with a stake in Patrick’s soul debt aren’t finished with him yet. Bound by promises they can’t break, Patrick and Jono must find a way to survive a threat that takes no prisoners and is stalking them relentlessly through the city streets. <br> </p> <p>Old and new betrayals are coming home to roost but the truth - buried in blood - is more poisonous than the lies being spun. Trying to outrun death is a nightmare - one Patrick may never wake up from.<br> </p> <p><i>All Souls Near &amp; Nigh</i> is a 104,000 word m/m urban fantasy with a gay romantic subplot and a HFN ending. It is a direct sequel to <i>A Ferry of Bones &amp; Gold</i>, and listening to the first book in the series would be helpful in enjoying this one.
