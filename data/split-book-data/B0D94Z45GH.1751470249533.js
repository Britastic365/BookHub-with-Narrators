window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A kraken, a scientist, and a love under pressure.</b></p> <p>As a kraken bodyguard, I rarely get human clients. When I do, the only way to protect them is to form a telepathic bond. I don't like it, but after my wife's death years ago I've learned to build an impenetrable shield around myself and my emotions, until I meet my newest client. She's a scientist investigating an ancient relic on the ocean floor. The abyssal plane is no place for humans, but the job is the job, so I shut off my soul, bury my secrets, and link our minds.</p> <p>The flood of her emotions takes me by surprise. I thought I would be in charge, but our bond is stripping us both bare, layer after layer, until she can see my bleeding wounds, and I can taste her unspoken desires.</p> <p>We cannot be together. We can't even touch. She breathes air, and I live at high pressure at the bottom of the ocean. Our feelings bring us nothing but torment, and I know once she's on dry land again, I'll have to sever our bond.</p> <p>But when she's betrayed by the people she's working for, and her life is in danger, I will not rest until she's safe in all of my arms.</p> <p><i>Monster Security Agency is the most elite bodyguard service in the world. These monster bodyguards are lethal, powerful, and determined to protect their clients at all costs. They shouldn't fall in love with their principals, but if they do? Things are bound to explode.</i></p> <p><i>Here come spicy, romantic, and action-packed tales by your favorite paranormal and sci-fi romance authors: Cassie Alexander, Eden Ember, Layla Fae, and Cara Wylde.
