window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The fourth and final book in the best-selling Dark Fae Kings series.</p> <p>I'd dance on a razor's edge for my mates, but the Fae kings are no longer mine. They belong to the usurper queen, bound by her black magic.</p> <p>Rydstrom and Baron have forgotten what I once meant to them. The Winter King, however, remembers me, but he's embraced the dark side.</p> <p>The world isn't big enough for all of us - it's either me or the kings. <br> So, I'll lure them to Hell's inferno to finish what they started in the Wild Hunt - to hunt down their mate to the bitter end. Love is a battle, and I'll allow no one to take my mates from me.</p>";
