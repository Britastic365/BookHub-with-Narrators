Juggling all of that would be a challenge on its own, but when you add in my day job as a detective? It’s almost impossible. <br> <br> But all of that stuff is the least of my worries.

And the deeper I dig, the more I realize that this isn’t an accident. The murderer is trying to get my attention, and if I don’t unmask him soon, this could be the end for not just me, but the four gargoyles who have become more important to me than life itself… <br> <br> <b> Scroll up and grab your copy today!</b></p>";
