When Simon goes missing, Jared is convinced creatures from the faerie world have something to do with it. Mallory is not convinced. That is, until she and Jared contend with a band of menacing, marauding goblins. Simon is clearly in danger, and it’s up to Mallory and Simon to save him before it’s too late.</p>";
