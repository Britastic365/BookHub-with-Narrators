Waking up sandwiched between two of them! </p> <p>Quinn Preston, a financial analyst, is not happy when her friends dare her to pick up a handsome stranger at a wedding reception. What better reason to give up men could she have when her previous long-term relationship had not only been lackluster in the bedroom, but he had also cheated? </p> <p>Logan Reed, a successful business owner, can't believe he's attracted to the woman in the ugly Pepto-Bismol pink bridesmaid dress. And to boot, she's more than tipsy. After turning down her invitation for a one-night stand, he finds her in the parking lot too impaired to drive. He rescues her and takes her home. His home. </p> <p>The next morning, Quinn's conservative life turns on its ear when Logan introduces her to pleasures she never before even considered. To make things more complicated, Logan already has a lover. </p> <p>Tyson White, ex-pro-football player, is completely in love with Logan. He has mixed emotions when Logan brings home Quinn.
