window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Keep your enemies closer....</b></p> <p>I've proven I can stand with the fiercest gang in Paradise Bend. Now it's time to crush my traitor ex-fianc√© and his stooges into smithereens. </p> <p>They've already butchered my family. I can't let them destroy the streets I called home. </p> <p>Wylder Noble and his inner circle are ready to rain down their own brand of justice. Too bad they can't seem to decide whether they'd rather kiss me or kill me. </p> <p>To be fair, I'm having the same problem when it comes to these four infuriatingly hot and dangerous men. </p> <p>Whichever we pick, we'd better decide fast. Because my ex isn't pulling any punches...and the greatest threat may come from right within the Nobles' ranks. </p> <p><i>Perilous Lady</i> is the second book in a new gritty contemporary romance series from best-selling author Eva Chase (writing as Eva Chance) and Harlow King. No major triggers, but be prepared for domineering men who make their own rules, a rebellious heroine who's not afraid to get her hands dirty, and an enemies-to-lovers romance where the girl gets <i>all</i> the guys. It's going to be a wild, bloody ride!*</p>";
