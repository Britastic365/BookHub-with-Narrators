window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A novella set in the best-selling, award-winning Beyond series. </p> <p>Hacker Noah Lennox lives in the shadows, fighting a one-man war against the corrupt leader of Sector Five. The only weak spot in his armor is his best friend's sweet younger sister: the girl he swore to save, even from himself. With her brother dead and a target on their backs, getting her out of the sector - and out of danger - meant giving her up for good. </p> <p>Or so he thought. </p> <p>Emma Cibulski has made her own home in Sector Four, as a full member of the O'Kane gang and apprentice to their infamous tattoo artist. When Noah - the first man she ever loved - stumbles back into her life, it's her chance to have it all. The spark between them burns hotter than ever, and this time her fantasies are far from innocent. </p> <p>But can they handle the heat, or will Noah's dark secrets drive them apart forever? </p> <i>Beyond Temptation</i> was originally published in the anthology <i>Marked</i> alongside stories by Vivian Arend and Lauren Dane. <p></p>";
