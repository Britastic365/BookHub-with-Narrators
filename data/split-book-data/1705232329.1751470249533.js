window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Roses are red. Violets are blue. You came for me. Now, I'm coming for you.</p> <p>A year ago, I thought my whole world had ended. My family was dead. The life that I knew had been changed forever. Now I know that was just the beginning. I faced down the devil who destroyed my family, and I f--king lost. I've become the thing I hate most in this world, and there is no turning back. Even a contract with a demon couldn't save me from the creature that now inhabits my body.</p> <p>Arrius Priest is planning something big. Something that threatens not just the society of hunters my parents belonged to, but the existence of the human race as we know it. Even though none of us are completely human anymore - not even Maverick - we won't abandon it. I may have failed once before, but I won't fail again.</p> <p>It takes a monster to destroy a monster, so a monster I will become.</p>";
