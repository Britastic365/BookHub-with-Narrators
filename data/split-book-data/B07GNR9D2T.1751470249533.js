window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Getting blackmailed sucks. Getting blackmailed by Satan into ghost writing his autobiography/romance really sucks - hard. </p> <p>But I’m not a weenie or a welsher. I’m a semi-materialistic, Prada lovin’ Vampyre-Demon with a bad attitude and a serious lack of cheating skills. If I were a good cheater, I wouldn’t be in this heinous position. I lost, and now I have to pay. </p> <p>However, the price might deplete the wavering amount of sanity I have left...so I’m turning to you, dear diary, to pour out my inappropriate feelings and murderous inclinations toward a family member who shall remain nameless. Who in the hell am I kidding? I’m gonna name that butthole over and over on these secret pages. It’s Satan or Lucifer or the Lord of Darkness or the Dark Angel - or, as I like to call him, Uncle F--ker. </p> <p>That’s why I have chosen you, dear diary. You don’t have a mouth, as far as I know, and if you do, I’ll remove it - violently. Please keep that in mind as I tell you all my secrets. I’ve dealt with talking books and walls, and they’re a real pain in the ass. So if you turn out to be one of those, we’ll have a problem. </p> <p>Sit back. Relax, and get ready for a hellish ride. </p> <p>xoxo, Astrid </p> <p>Note from author: Dear lover of Lucifer, Astrid and all things Hot Damned aka fabulous reader, it’s me, Robyn Peterman - the insane creator of the Hot Damned series - with a little message for you. This is a Hot Damned extra! It’s short. It’s snarky, fun, and it’s short. If you haven’t litsened to <i>Fashionably Flawed</i>, audiobook nine, you will not understand this, and it has spoilers in it that will mess up your enjoyment of <i>Fashionably Flawed</i>. </p> <p>If you haven’t listened to any of the Hot Damned series, this will make no sense to you whatsoever. LOL. So, there you go. This is just a little ditty that I couldn’t get out of my head and thought the true fans of the Hot Damned series would enjoy. Astrid and Satan are two of my favorite characters, and I could write about them forever. Enjoy Astrid’s dairy of her month with Satan while writing his autobiography/romance. God knows I certainly did. LOL.</p> <p>xoxo, Robyn</p>";
