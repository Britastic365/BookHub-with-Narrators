I protect Marisol from the vicious men in my brutal cartel, including myself. I've kept the promise I made to my boss on the night of her capture: <i>No one touches her. </i></p> <p>But she runs from me at the first opportunity, escaping the safe cage I built for her. I've denied myself for far too long. She's made the mistake of believing I'm gentle and forgiving. There's nothing gentle about what I intend to do to her once I catch her, and she'll have to beg for my forgiveness. </p> <p>I've spent endless nights imagining so many delicious ways to torment her. Now that she's defied the cartel, I can indulge all of my twisted desires. I'll never let her escape me again. Marisol is mine.</p>";
