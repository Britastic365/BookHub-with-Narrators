He spoke into my mind, saying things that couldn't be true. That I'd been bitten. That I was going to turn. That I had to obey him if I wanted to survive.</p> <p>He was beaten, but his voice rang with power, and his body called to mine. And when he won our freedom, I learned he was far more powerful than I realized. I escaped one prison just to land in another. Now I'm caught in a war between shiftersâ€”and my protector has become my captor.</p>";
