window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>At first glance I probably seem like any good-looking guy in their late twenties. I have an obscene amount of confidence, a tattooed body sculpted by the Nordic gods, and I love the ladies as much as they love me. If I'm not base jumping or car racing, I'm chasing other devious thrills with the woman of the week. And that's fine if you're the average single guy.</p> <p>But I'm not the average single guy. I'm Crown Prince Magnus of Norway, and my latest scandal just landed my entire royal family in hot water. Now the only way the monarchy can save face is for me to smarten up - publicly. If I don't, I'll no longer be heir apparent to the throne. So it's either I abdicate my future role as King or...I get married. To a blue-blooded stranger.</p> <p>Enter Princess Isabella of the tiny country of Liechtenstein. Quiet, intelligent, and uniquely beautiful, Ella doesn't like this arrangement any more than I do, and she's not afraid to show it. She says I'm a womanizer, that I don't take anything seriously, that my ego should be taken down a few pegs, and I think she aims to make me miserable for the rest of my life. </p> <p>But even as our arranged marriage becomes a war of wit and words, I'm determined to break through Ella's prim and proper fa√ßade to find the wild, sexual, and risk-taking woman underneath. I want to uncover the Queen inside her. The only question is-will she let me?</p> <p><i>Contains mature themes.</i></p>";
