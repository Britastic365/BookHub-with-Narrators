window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Onyx: I'm a city wolf - a damaged and injured one at that. Obviously, the absolute last place I should be when I'm in heat is in the middle of the woods with unmated male shifters in the wild able to scent me. But here I am, running for my life. I'm not used to anyone being nice to me, let alone helping me. Even being the daughter of a pack alpha doesn't keep you safe when you're the lone freak in your pack who can't shift. I'm being hunted out here in the woods, and yet somehow I feel safe on the doorstep of the big, brusque stranger who offers me sanctuary. Taron isn't like any of the shifters I grew up around. He's a bear shifter for one - an alpha, no less - with a protective streak a mile wide...for me.</p> <p>Taron: Not much to say. I knew from the moment Onyx found herself trying to escape her troubles in my woods. It hit me like a damn freight train. The she-wolf was my mate. Meaning she was mine to heal. And mine to protect at all costs.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
