But then her older brother goes missing and our plans are put on hold. That is until she mysteriously texts me for help before going completely radio-silent.</p> <p>I’d always heard small-town people are friendly and welcoming, but that isn’t my experience. These locals are not only unfriendly, they're downright hostile. Even Chavvah's hot younger brother, Babel, strongly suggests that I haul my butt back where I came from. I’m undeterred. I’m not about to go anywhere until I find out what happened to my bestie and her brother and solve the mystery this town is trying so hard to hide.</p> <p>I may be psychic, but it doesn’t take a fortune teller to see things are about to get real hairy in Peculiar!</p> <p>Books in the Peculiar Mysteries series from <i>USA Today</i> best-selling author Renee George are laugh-out-loud, grip-the-edge-of-your-seat, and swoon-as-you-fall-in-love tales of mystery, humor, and romance that take place in the small (fictional) Ozark shifter town of Peculiar, Missouri.</p>";
