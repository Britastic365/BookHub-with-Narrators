window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Elizabeth Cabot is all business. She knows how to maximize her investments and cut her losses—in both her career and her personal life. So when she discovers that Jack Fairfax has deceived her, she's determined to end their relationship. Putting a stop to their budding romance is easy. But breaking up their business deal will be more difficult. Despite all her efforts, she has no luck disentangling herself from Jack's client company, Excalibur. But the situation becomes even more strained when a new obstacle emerges: a lethal act of sabotage that could put both of them out of business for good.</p> <p>Elizabeth is no fool. If she can help Jack save Excalibur, she'll recoup her substantial investment plus millions in profit. Putting her emotions aside, she insists on helping him search for the scientist who's disappeared with a valuable new crystal that could revolutionize the high-tech industry.</p> <p>The trail leads Elizabeth and Jack to a fringe film festival, but their goal is elusive. Life starts to imitate art, and double-dealing seems to be the name of the game. For these business adversaries turned reluctant partners, keeping an eye on each other—and the lid on a sizzling attraction—seems the only insurance against further treachery. But with millions at stake, trust can turn to betrayal in the blink of an eye.</p>";
