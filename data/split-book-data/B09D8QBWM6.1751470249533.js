window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Corner a wolf and she will always fight back.</b></p> <p>I finally did it. I took that last step, and it was everything I wanted. My relationship with my five mates has never been better. They've embraced not only me as a part of their lives but also my daughter, and this feels like the family I always dreamed of. I don't mean just myself and my mates, but the entire pack. They call me \"Alpha\". No, I'm not <i>the</i> alpha, but I'm learning how to step up. I got this. I'd better, since Wolf's Run has thrown open our doors to more than just wolves, but it seems like my version of winging it is working for all of us.</p> <p>But not all shifters have packs. That doesn't mean they don't want them. These new neighbors might not be wolves, but everyone wants a community they can count on. The trick will be making sure ours doesn't fall apart in the chaos. Or get taken from us.</p> <p>Between the antics of these teenagers, the insanity of so many changes happening at once, and the enemies my mates and I have already made, things are out of control. I feel like I'm chasing my tail. Thankfully, I've learned a few new tricks.</p> <p>Once, I was just the nice lady next door. Now, this is <i>my</i> pack, and I've become a real bitch. </p> <p><b>The</b><b><i> Wolves Next Door</i></b><b> series contains profanity, consensual sex, and one adult woman who falls for multiple younger men.</b></p>";
