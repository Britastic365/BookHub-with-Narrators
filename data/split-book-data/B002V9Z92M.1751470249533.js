In King City, the young King Nash is clinging to the throne, while rebel lords in the north and south build armies to unseat him. War is coming. And the mountains and forest are filled with spies and thieves. This is where Fire lives, a girl whose beauty is impossibly irresistible and who can control the minds of everyone around her.</p> <p>Exquisitely romantic, this companion to the highly praised <i>Graceling</i> has an entirely new cast of characters, save for one person who plays a pivotal role in both books. You don't need to have read or heard <i>Graceling</i> to love <i>Fire</i>. But if you haven't, you'll be dying to listen to it next.</p>";
