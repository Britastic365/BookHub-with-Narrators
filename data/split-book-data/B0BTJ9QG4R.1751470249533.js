Now that they've seen my horrifying new power, will they decide I'm an enemy after all?</p> <p>With what they put me through, I'm not sure I even want to stick with them. These brutal men aren't the boys I fell in love with anymore.</p> <p>But nothing matters more than learning how to control my own vicious urges. So I'll accept a tentative truce while we hunt down more answers...by turning to the very monsters our creator feared most.</p>";
