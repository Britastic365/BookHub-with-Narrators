window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>There are two things I can’t get out of my head. My completely inappropriate feelings for my stupidly hot best friend, Keegan, and a vacuum. Right now, the vacuum is taking the front seat. It’s the key for landing a major client—and the only way I’ll finally prove that I’ve been the creative mastermind behind my ad team’s success. Nothing—not even my embarrassing stutter—is going to get in my way. Putting myself in the team’s spotlight also puts me on my ridiculously hot CEO’s radar.</p> <p>How am I supposed to navigate a lifelong stutter, my boss’s unexpected interest, and Keegan staring in all of my nighttime fantasies, all while nailing the biggest pitch of my career? Head Over Feels is a laugh-out-loud, single POV, friends to lovers rom-com featuring a hilarious squad of friends, a swoony slow burn, and a heart-felt HEA for a woman who thinks she has it all figured out.</p>";
