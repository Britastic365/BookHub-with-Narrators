Nothing holds meaning anymore, and nothing will—not until I bring my best friend back home. It is all I want to do, but there is so much more going on.</p> <p>A sadistic Midnight Witch has a secret vendetta against one of the most powerful Skews in St. Louis. She is mass-producing monsters and sending them all over the city to sow chaos. As if that wasn’t enough to keep her busy, she develops a new vendetta against me after I ruin her plans.</p> <p>The witch with a “b” is totally insane and vows to kill everyone I love as payment for my interference. She makes good on her promise by going after my family and even my livelihood.</p> <p>But when she goes after the man I love, things reach a different level of messed up. Her magic is powerful, but so are my new skills, and I will take her down, even if I go down with her.</p> <p><b>If you enjoy K.F. Breene, Shannon Mayer, Annette Marie, and CN Crawford, then step into a conspiracy where you don’t know whom to trust.</b></p>";
