You’d think I was getting everything I ever wanted with the girl and the winning record, but I still have a promise to fulfill to my childhood best friend.</p> <p><b>Becca</b></p> <p>“Never let them see you sweat” has been my life motto since I decided to make a name for myself as the most-sought-after sports agent.
