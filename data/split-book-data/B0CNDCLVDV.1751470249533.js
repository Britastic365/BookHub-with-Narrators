They raised me to be meek and stifled my magic.</p> <p>No more.</p> <p>A brutal murder led me to discover a mysterious house full of magicâ€”and the ancient, powerful demon within. He says my power can change the world, that I can kill the evil creature I once worshipped.</p> <p>But at what cost?</p> <p><b>Callum</b></p> <p>For two thousand years, I've been alone. Slaughtering fallen Gods as I searched for the witch that haunted my dreams, begging for my help.</p> <p>Now that I've found her, I will protect her with my life.
