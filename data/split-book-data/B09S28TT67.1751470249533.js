I want to prove to myself I don’t have to be the guy everyone thinks I am. She knocked down the walls I spent my whole life building. </p> <p>Franny </p> <p>My last name opened the doors, but proving I was worth the title of TV producer took all of my time. He walked in with a chip on his shoulder. I was happy to point out all his flaws. Falling for him was inevitable. When scandal hits, no one expected me to stand by his side. Not even him. But I’ve learned that you get only one love.</p>";
