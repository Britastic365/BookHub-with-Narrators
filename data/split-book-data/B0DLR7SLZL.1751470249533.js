window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Hayden is enjoying a much-needed girls’ trip in Vegas. While basking in the comforts of the plush suites at HAYDAR Resort &amp; Casino, they eat exceptionally well, tour the town safely, and role-play—for fun only.<br> <br> On the last night, the group of ladies dress as sex workers. Separated from the group, Hayden is mistaken for a real prostitute by a brooding, remarkably handsome man. Playing along, Hayden sets her price to attend a dinner function with him. Her conduct at the event earns her a \"john\" for the night. <br> Thrilled and simultaneously frightened, Hayden enjoys a night of sensual wonderment and discovery.<br> <br> Ishaan is hosting a BSU Panthers' event he could care less about attending. <br> <br> Despite his busy schedule as head of operations at three resorts, he still found time to honor his commitment to old college affiliates. Upon entering the casino lobby, Ishaan is blinded by a daring prostitute sitting all too comfortably. He’d just addressed this very issue with his security team. <br> The woman’s audacity is striking, and so is her curvy, lengthy body in a fitted cut-out dress, exposing her abs and a bare hip. Assessing the sex worker, Ishaan invites her to the Panthers' event … for a fee, of course. Within a few hours, he gets more than what he’d bargained for.<br> <br> One night of an unexpected sensual excursion is a fun luck of the draw. Two nights of the same is kismet. But the consequences of these two passion-filled nights puts Ishaan and Hayden on a course-collision, proving how throwing caution to the wind can bring about life-long consequences.</p>";
