window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>He's baseball's biggest heartbreaker. I'm a recovering romantic...and his new trainer.</b></p> <p>Parker Knight is a smooth-talking pitcher with a smile for days and a roster of broken hearts behind him. Those are only a few reasons why a guy like him is never getting near my heart.</p> <p>After making a move to prove I deserve a place within my dad's baseball empire, the last thing on my mind is a playboy pitcher.</p> <p>I didn't know who he was when we randomly met off the field, and Parker certainly had no idea I'm the team owner's daughter. He thought I was going to be his next conquest. I didn’t mean to shut the guy down so hard, and I didn’t expect to see him in my gym on the first day at the office.</p> <p>No one has ever seen the real guy behind the bad boy of baseball, but the more I get to know Parker, the harder it is to ignore the feelings I'm catching. I’ve had my heart broken too many times before. How can I trust it with the biggest heartbreaker of them all?</p> <p><i>The Changeup</i> is a sports romance that's a mix of sweet and sizzle, with toe-curling kisses, swoony book boyfriends, and a happily ever after.</p>";
