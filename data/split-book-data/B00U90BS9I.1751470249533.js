window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>If the sexy construction crew were Powertools, their cousin mechanics are sure to be Hot Rods. Nothing's sexier than seven men with hot rods. </p> <p>His demons are no match for her passion. </p> <p>Kaige \"Super Nova\" Davis doesn't carry a chip on his shoulder. It's more like a beast in his belly... and right now the monster he's fought so hard to tame is growling to unleash its legendary temper. </p> <p>Eli has gone behind his back and hired a marketing consultant. But when Kaige storms into the office to give Eli hell, one look at the mocha-skinned brunette seated across the desk flips a switch in his brain. And in his pants. </p> <p>Nola Brown has never experienced Kaige's powerful brand of sexual charisma. He makes her want to ditch her professional façade and be herself - a mistake she can't afford to make. Yet just as he talks her defenses down - and proves that grease marks look just as good on her skin as a silk suit - she stumbles in on one of the Hot Rods' late-night, full-throttle sessions. </p> <p>Now Kaige wonders if she'll embrace this glimpse of their future, or if she'll run as fast as her killer stilettos can take her. </p> <p>Warning: This audiobook contains a garage full of hot, passionate men who are good with their hands, and a woman who isn't afraid to get a little down and dirty. And cute puppies. And did we mention hot men?</p>";
