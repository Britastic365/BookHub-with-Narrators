window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A sexy category romance from Entangled's Brazen imprint...</b> </p> <p>This kind of temptation is worth the risk.... </p> <p>Dawn Freeze had a huge crush on Hawk Rain for years, and the entire town knows it. It's understandable - the man is total hotness. That tall, lean body. Intense dark eyes. And always one foot out the door. Now he's on leave for exactly one week. And this time, he's made it crystal clear that he only wants one thing. Her. </p> <p>Hawk's been fighting his attraction to Dawn for as long as he can remember. She's his best friend's little sister, and that means hands-off. Except now she's all grown up, and her sweet sexiness is exactly what he craves. But just as Hawk allows himself one mindblowingly intense night with Dawn, he learns that everyone he loves is in danger. Especially her. </p> <p>And the only way to protect Dawn is to push her away.... </p>";
