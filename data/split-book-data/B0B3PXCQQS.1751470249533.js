He is willing to stop at nothing to see both Tir n’Aill and Earth as his dominion, and he'll crush the self-righteous Seelie beneath his bootheels.</p> <p>He had wished for Abigail to stand beside him as his queen, but that went terribly wrong when she chose death over becoming his bride. It was a setback, certainly, but not one he could not overcome.</p> <p>Yet despite being wrenched from the song of life, Abigail returns to Tir n’Aill, only to be hunted by both Seelie and Unseelie alike. She does not know why she was returned or for what purpose, but it was clear that two paths lay before her:</p> <p>Is she to become Valroy’s enemy, or to allow him to make her his queen in chains?</p>";
