He stood in the shadows smelling of whiskey and death and wrapped a broken, blood-crusted necklace around my neck. I thought he'd strangle me with it.</p> <p>That night, he left a message for my father. He said he'd be back to take something precious.</p> <p>I never delivered that message, though. I wonder if things would be different if I had because now, two years later, he's back. And he's not hiding in any shadows.</p> <p>He's come to make good on his promise.</p> <p>He's back to take that something precious.</p> <p>Me.</p> <p><b>Stefan</b></p> <p>Marchese is the manipulator of my family's tragedy. I won't just bring him to his knees. I'll bury him for what he did.</p> <p>Taking his daughter is only the beginning. I'll do it knowing I'm starting a war. I'll do it knowing my enemies will become his allies. They'll stop at nothing to destroy me and he'll stop at nothing to get her back.</p> <p>I've never shied away from war, though. I'm not one to play nice and I don't share my toys. I'll demolish you if you touch what's mine.</p> <p>And she is most definitely mine.</p>";
