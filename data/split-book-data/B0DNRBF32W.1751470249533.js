window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I always thought I’d start the apocalypse. Instead I’ve been asked to help end it.<br> <br> How does one stop the end of the world, you might ask? You gotta knock up Lucifer’s vessel before he does.<br> <br> I know, I know. I was surprised too. But let me tell you, if ever there was an incubus made for the job, it’s me.<br> <br> With a name like Sin, you’d think this should have been the easiest task I’d ever been assigned. And you’d be correct. Except said vessel is a beautiful and dangerously powerful succubus in her own right. Oh, and she’s not interested.<br> <br> Not in me or any of the other horsemen who were assigned to protect her. Yup, that’s right. The four horsemen of the apocalypse are back.<br> <br> War<br> Pestilence<br> Famine<br> Death<br> <br> She may not be our biggest fan, but one of us has to be her baby’s daddy. Which is why she’s been forced to live with us until we get the job done. We’ve never been very good at sharing. Or at saving things instead of destroying them, but when you know who calls in a favor, you don’t say no.<br> <br> The Doomsday clock is ticking, so save the world it is.<br> <br> Now if only we could get Merri to play ball. Because if we don’t find a way to get her pregnant before he does, then it’s not just the end of us. It’s the end of everything.</p> <p><b>For fans of Supernatural and American Horror Story, USA Today bestselling authors Meg Anne and K. Loraine are thrilled to bring you the final installment in the Mate Games Universe.</b></p> <p><b>Warning: The Mate Games: Apocalypse is a spicy paranormal series featuring morally gray heroes whose methods of protection aren’t always above board. Not that you can expect much honor from a celibate recluse, an incubus rockstar, the original shadow daddy, and a grumpy ex-Spartan. They are the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, after all.</b></p> <p><i>Please refer to the authors' website for all tropes, tags, and CWs.</i></p>";
