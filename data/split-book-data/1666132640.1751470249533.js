By night, I'm slaying demons and ghosts who have dared to slip through the Veil.</p> <p>Or at least, that's what I should be doing.</p> <p>The problem is Jay, who also happened to be my immortal guardian and now ex-boyfriend, was banished from being with me. And now my new trainer is a previously dead friend of mine that I helped bring back to life. With both of us nursing broken hearts, we embark on a road trip to New Orleans to help him win back his long-lost love.</p> <p>As if that's not tricky enough, we're also being hunted by a demon with a grudge, and I'm not sure if all the training in the world is going to help me. One thing's for sure, the more complicated our relationship gets, the scarier things become.</p> <p>Whoever said love is a battlefield never had to fight demons at the same time.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
