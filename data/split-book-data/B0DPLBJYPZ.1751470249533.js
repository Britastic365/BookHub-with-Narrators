window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Two years ago, one decision changed everything…</b><br> <br> Callie Ward knows what love feels like. She’s lived it. Breathed it. It was the kind of love she’d thought would last forever…until it didn’t. And the resulting heartache almost destroyed her. So she ran. Left the small town of Misty Peak, not sure if she’d ever return. But thanks to fate and family ties, she’s back—and so is the man who broke her heart. Ignoring him is her only option, until that proves impossible.<br> <br> One split-second decision lost Lock Walker the only woman he’s ever loved, a mistake from which, two years later, he still hasn’t recovered. A mistake that cost him everything. Now, finally, Lock and Callie are both home, and he’s determined to make amends. Except, she won’t give him the time he needs to earn his redemption. But that soon changes when Lock learns he’s not the only one happy about her homecoming.<br> <br> Someone’s watching Callie. Someone who wants her all to themselves. Lock needs to earn her trust back fast in order to protect her—because losing her a second time isn’t an option.</p>";
