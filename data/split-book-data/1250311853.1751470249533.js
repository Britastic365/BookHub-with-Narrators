window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Too Far Gone</i> by Allison Brennan is a thrilling audiobook that will leave listeners breathless. </p> <p>When a man who appears mentally unstable holds a group of people hostage and dies in a shootout with the FBI, Special Agent Lucy Kincaid is assigned to investigate what happened. </p> <p>Up until two months ago, McMahon was a respected scientist - then his wife left him, he lost his job, and he was arrested for assaulting a former colleague. The one person who might have answers - his research assistant - has disappeared. </p> <p>While Lucy is investigating this bizarre case, her husband, Sean, is on top of the world: His son, Jesse, is visiting for the summer. They are having a blast, until someone follows them. Sean is positive the surveillance is connected to Jesse’s stepfather - a man who had once laundered money for a violent drug cartel. But when Lucy and Jesse are run off the road, they begin to wonder if the attack is connected to Jesse...or Lucy’s current case. </p> <p>Nothing is what it seems - neither the McMahon investigation nor the car accident. As Sean and Lucy dig deep into the lives of everyone involved, one thing becomes clear: If they don’t find the truth fast, everyone they care about is in danger.</p>";
