window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>His Eyes Were As Commanding As His Mouth... </b></p> <p>When I met him, he was just a gray-eyed stranger behind a mask. He turned my head when no one else did, and he upped the ante by showing me what I'd been missing when our tongues met for the first time. </p> <p>When I got to know him, he was still a stranger on the other end of the phone. He made my toes curl and my knees weak with his dirty words and dirtier suggestions. I was his wild ace, and he knew how to play me just right so that we both won. </p> <p>But when the masks fell off and we finally put all our cards on the table, I had to decide if I'd fold â€” or go all in. </p> <p><i>Wild Aces</i> is a standalone erotic novel. If you enjoyed Brea from the Unblocked Collection, this is her story. </p>";
