One night turns into two…and then three…and then it becomes clear all my nights will be reserved for this woman. </p> <p>But I gave Rancor my word—and I have to keep it. </p> <p>She’s too ferocious to take by force so I drug her before I steal her from Delacroix.

And once her father comes for her, we’ll eat him too.” </p> <p>With my obligation fulfilled, I’m free to go. But can I leave such a beautiful woman to a horrible fate?</p>";
