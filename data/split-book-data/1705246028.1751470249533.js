Sent me plummeting straight to Hell.</b></p> <p>When I'm captured by demons and forced into the fighting pits of the Seventh Circle of Hell, I need to stay alive long enough to claw my way back to Heaven and destroy the archangels who betrayed me.</p> <p>Four dangerous men stand between me and my vengeance.</p> <p>A deadly Nephilim in self-imposed exile. Hunger incarnate, ravenous for an angel. The heir to Satan's sinful throne. And the prince who bound my soul to his until I win my freedom. They think I'm still pure. They think I'm innocent. They think they'll enjoy corrupting me.</p> <p>Joke's on them. This angel's no saint. If Heaven doesn't want me, I'll be bad for the Hell of it.</p> <p><b>Contains mature themes.</b></p>";
