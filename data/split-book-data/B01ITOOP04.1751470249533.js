window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>They both wanted her. The question was, could they share her? </p> <p>Abducted by alien slavers, along with her group of teenage misfits, Louisa doesn't think her week can get any stranger until two big purple warriors arrive to the rescue - and then fight over who gets to keep her. Not interested in a winner, she clobbers them, but when they regain consciousness, they're even more determined to claim her. </p> <p>Best friends Brax and Xarn share everything; loot, jobs, and trouble until they come across a luscious human that stirs their possessive side. Their battle over who gets to keep her ends in a tie due to matching concussions, but what's a bruise or two when it comes to winning her as a mate? When she keeps denying them both, they put aside their rivalry to team up and claim the one they want. </p>";
