window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Growing up, I had nothing but my good grades and them: the Vanguard brothers.</b></p> <p>They are the golden boys of our school, destined to be the alphas of our pack. They’re possessive, scaring away everyone else who might get close to me—until the night of their first shift. I’d been told over and over I could never be their mate, but the boy’s wolves had other ideas….</p> <p>So, I’m whisked away, told to forget them—and I do, right up until they walk in through my door, telling me all the things I’d secretly dreamed of: that I’m their fated mate and that they refuse to settle for anyone else. But I’m forced to push them away.</p> <p>Why? Because their parents were right to send me away. I’ll never be what they need me to be, but these guys? Back then, they never knew how to take no for an answer, and now they’re coming for me, whether I’m ready or not.</p>";
