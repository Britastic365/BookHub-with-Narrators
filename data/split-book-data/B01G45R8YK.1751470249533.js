window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Shattered by You</i> can be listened to as a standalone. </p> <p>From <i>New York Times</i> and <i>USA Today</i> best-selling author Nashoda Rose comes a full-length friends-to-lovers romance. </p> <p>What started out as a deal quickly became a friendship that conquered monsters. </p> <p>I killed, but I escaped hell. Emotionless. Disconnected. Cold. A mannequin. It's what I'd become in order to survive the years held in captivity. I was able to endure the abuse and devastating loss as long as I remained detached. </p> <p>But he wouldn't let me. Crisis, the bass guitarist in my brother's rock band, Tear Asunder. He's cocky, rude, a total man-whore. But the rock star has far more beneath the surface of his inked skin, and he's determined to make me laugh again. He made me a \"deal\", but really it was blackmail. </p> <p>His terms were simple. Until his playful honesty became the building blocks to something unexpected. Something strong enough to pull me from the eye of the storm. Because even though I escaped years of abuse, it didn't mean I was free. </p> <p>For mature audiences only - 18+. Listener discretion is advised. Dark elements. </p>";
