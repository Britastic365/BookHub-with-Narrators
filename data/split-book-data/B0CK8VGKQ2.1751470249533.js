window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The Demon Queen Trials Complete Trilogy. All three books are included in this set. </b><br> <br> I never thought I'd be singing happy birthday to myself in a dungeon. And yet when a sinfully sexy demon crashes happy hour, that's exactly what happens. He’s known as the Lord of Chaos, and he’s mistaken me for my succubus doppelgänger.<br> <br> Happy birthday to me.<br> <br> When he tastes my blood, he finally understands I’m mortal. And I realize we have something in common: we both crave revenge. So we make a deal: I can stay in the forbidden city to hunt for my mom's killer. In return, I’ll help him get the vengeance he craves. I just have to pose as a sexy succubus. One problem--he's my number one suspect.<br> <br> And that’s increasingly hard to remember as he teaches me my role: seduction. With each heated touch I drift further into peril. And if I fall under his seductive spell, death awaits me.<br> <br> This box set includes all three books: <br> <br> 1. <i>City of Thorns</i><br> 2. <i>Lord of Embers</i><br> 3. <i>Garden of Serpents</i></p>";
