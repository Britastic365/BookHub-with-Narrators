window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Deadly sin has consumed Cardinal City. Violence, murder, and mayhem are only the beginning. A family of genetically modified heroes is the city's only hope...if only they can resist sin long enough, they just might stand a chance.</p> <p>Disgraced hero Evan Lazarus punishes himself in the underground cage fighting scene. He blames himself for the tragedy that tore his family apart and left the city without its saviors. Traveling a dark path toward vengeance, if he’s not careful, he’ll become the evil he was created to fight. And then he meets her - a woman who embodies his sin’s opposing virtue. She’s smart, relentless, and electrifying…. She’s everything he secretly craves.</p> <p>Grace Go almost died in the blast that killed her parents and now seeks justice for the survivors. When her investigation crosses paths with a fiercely protective but damaged hero, she is intrigued. The more she sees him, the more he ignites a desire she thought long gone, and the easier it is to stay ignorant to the secret that could ruin her opinion of him forever.</p> <p>When a figure from Evan’s past emerges, in league with the evil Syndicate, their scheme threatens to destroy everything he holds dear. Pushed to the limits, he will have to pull his family from the brink of oblivion and become the hero the city needs...or will envy drive him to destroy Grace and his only chance at love and redemption forever?</p> <p>The Deadly Seven is a paranormal/sci-fi romance featuring genetically modified heroes who must find a lifemate or become the deadly sin they are destined to destroy. Perfect for fans of superhero shows like <i>Batman</i>, <i>Arrow</i>, <i>The Flash</i>, and <i>Superman</i>... but with more heartfelt and hot romance from the hero and his love interest. If you like fated mates, second chances, a genetically modified band of warriors, alpha heroes, and strong heroines, then you'll fall head over heels for the Deadly Seven. For mature audiences only.</p>";
