But Karazov is a dangerous man who has an even more dangerous enemy and suddenly Caitlin is thrust into a shadowy world of intrigue and deception, unable to trust anyone, not even the one man who can help. Now she must outsmart the cleverest of killers, a psychopath obsessed with the Wind Dancer whose ruthless plan spans continents and whose lethal rampage won't stop at one death...or two...or even three - not until he finally gets what he wants: the secret Caitlin will die to keep.";
