window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>At the edge of a cliff, in the pouring rain, the man I once loved attacks me.</b> His fingers tear at my flesh, his breath hot in my ear as he spews venomous words of hate and promises of death.</p> <p>My only hope is Scythe. The psychopath locked away inside the mind of another. Letting him out will only cause chaos and violence. And yet, I utter his name and free him to save myself.</p> <p>Scythe is nothing like Vincent. He’s dark. Sarcastic. Sexy. The things he makes me do are wickedly sinful.</p> <p>But secret.</p> <p>Nash and War don’t know what I’ve done. If they knew Scythe’s true identity and the crimes he’s committed, they’d kill him in a heartbeat.</p> <p>I can’t let that happen. The empire I’m building can’t crumble.</p> <p>Not when I need it to save my family from the streets. Not when half the battle is keeping my head while my heart is split between three men.</p> <p>Not when the real killer is still out there, ready to ruin it all.</p> <p><b><i>Half the Battle is an adult #whychoose romance, meaning the main character has more than one love interest.
