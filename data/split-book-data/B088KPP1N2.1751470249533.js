window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A man of few words, Ranger Jay Daniels values the calm, quiet solitude of the Great Smoky Mountains. Never quite fitting in with either side of his family, he prefers the company of birds and trees to people. </p> <p>Yeah, he’d most definitely prefer a bird — any bird, any bird at all, take a vulture for instance — to the human-tornado hybrid that just blew onto his peaceful stretch of the Appalachian Trail. </p> <p>The path of true love never has run smooth for Olive Perry. After getting dumped and promptly abandoned in the middle of her multi-month hike, Olive swears off men. Determined to finish the long trek by herself, she doesn’t need a prince — or broody and taciturn ranger — to save her. Yet, when an early snowstorm threatens the mountains, and Ranger Daniels is charged with getting hikers to safety, that includes hot-tempered Olive Perry. </p> <p>Snowed in and forced to share an abandoned cabin, can Olive’s heated intensity melt Jay’s cool reserve? And if so, will this happy trail lead to true love? Or will their time together be just another bump in the road? </p> <p><i>Happy Trail</i> is a full-length contemporary romantic comedy, can be listened to as a standalone, and is book one in the Park Ranger series.</p>";
