But after Aon buried me in the Pool of the Ancients, I learned that Under wasn't done with me yet.</p> <p>Even though I escaped death the first time, there's a prophecy predicting my demise, and it's driving Aon mad. His desperation to protect me is dangerous, deadly, and I'm afraid of what he might do.</p> <p>The void that threatens to destroy this world is receding, yet Under is still not safe. I can feel it in my blood, the warning that something terrible is coming. Something bigger and stronger than all of us.</p> <p>But I am no longer the human girl merely fighting for survival.
