window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Quinton Aldren thought he could leave his past behind him.... He was wrong.</p> <p>First came the development of the Personality Matrix Construct—PMC, transferring human consciousness into a machine. It changed the galaxy and the way wars were fought. Then something went wrong with PMCs and the Federation Wars toppled the galactic order. PMCs became a menace to be hunted and exterminated.</p> <p>Long after the Federation Wars, the galaxy limps on. Spacers carve out an existence upon the bones of the old worlds, but things are about to change...something has begun broadcasting signals to reactivate PMCs that were stored in secret.</p> <p>Quinton Aldren is a PMC. His consciousness was uploaded and stored over a century ago, before the Federation Wars. On a dying world along the galactic fringe, Quinton Aldren awakens in the body of an archaic android that’s barely operational.</p> <p>All Quinton wants is to leave his past behind, but the broadcasts keep occurring. More PMCs are coming online, and not all of them are stable. Federation War machines are on the hunt for them, and they don’t care who gets in their way.</p> <p>Quinton might have missed the war, but his link to the past might be the key to save humanity’s future.</p> <p>From the author of the international best-selling First Colony series comes another science fiction series in a sprawling galactic setting. The Federation Chronicles is set far into the future long after humanity has colonized the stars.</p> <p>Strap yourself in. Federation Chronicles includes all three books in the best-selling military science fiction series.</p>";
