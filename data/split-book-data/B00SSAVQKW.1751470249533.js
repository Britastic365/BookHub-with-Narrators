Unsure if she's a spy or a pawn in someone else's game, Ariq isn't about to let her out of his sight until he finds out. </p> <p>After escaping her fourth kidnapping attempt in a year, Zenobia Fox has learned to guard her identity vigilantly. While her brother ,Archimedes, is notorious for his exploits, Zenobia has had no adventures to call her own--besides the stories she writes. But when she jumps at the chance to escape to the wilds of Australia and acquire research for her next story, Zenobia quickly discovers that the voyage will be far more adventurous than any fiction she could put to paper.</p>";
