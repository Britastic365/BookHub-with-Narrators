She is petite, with long flowing black hair. Her features are as foreign to me as any humans, but for some reason I find her face pleasing. <br> Before I can think better of it, my tongue sneaks out over my lips to scent my surroundings.<br> But all I can smell is her.<br> And I’ve never scented anything so delicious in my life.<br> Mine.<br> It’s all but a convulsion that tears through my body.<br> What? No! No, this cannot be happening!<br> My denials are weak, though. <br> Far louder is the cry: Mine, mine, mine, mine, <i>MINE</i>, MINE.</p>";
