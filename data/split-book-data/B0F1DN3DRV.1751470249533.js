I'm also not the type to lie to my family, sneak away to New York City for a week of no-holds-barred pleasure, or enjoy being told what a \"good girl\" I am when I get down on my knees for a gorgeous, commanding older man.<br> <br> <b>All I know for certain is that every night with Anthony, the man I hired to be my first </b><b><i>everything</i></b><b>, is better than the last. </b>He isn't just a sex god who brings my every fantasy wildly to life, he's smart, romantic, protective, and seemingly as affected by the chemistry between us as I am.<br> <br> <b>In just a few days, I'm falling hard for my fake boyfriend.</b><br> <br> Even crazier? Anthony says he wants more, too.<br> <br> More of my time, more of my body--and he's willing to quit the escort business to give the connection growing between us a real shot.<br> <br> Soon, we're making plans for a future beyond our steamy week between the sheets.<br> <br> <b>But what happens when I realize the man I've been falling for isn't a sex worker, at all, but a jaded billionaire who's been lying to me from the start? </b><br> <br> Can our love survive learning our time together truly has been one giant game of pretend?</p>";
