window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Be careful what you pray for...because even gods can be tempted.</b></p> <p>The Temple of Temptation is broken. The system is failing the priests who serve faithfully, but Zeal isn't missing. He's simply powerless—or was.</p> <p>As more priests believe in our god, the balance of power has been shifting. Temptation is thriving. Miracles are happening. The High Priest is struggling. In his attempts to control me, he's making it almost impossible to help the other gods.</p> <p>Something has to give, and I'm worried it might be me.</p> <p>With the last semester of my initiate training underway, things are supposed to be looking up. I finally have instructors who are grading me fairly. I no longer feel like a failure. However, my ties to the nobility of our barony have drawn just a little too much attention. The wrong kind.</p> <p>The High Priest wants to get rid of me. My enemies want to destroy me out of jealousy. The nobility wants to put me in my place. My lovers want to protect me at all costs because things are starting to get dangerous.</p> <p>None of that will stop me because gods aren't the only ones to answer prayers.</p> <p>I am the voice of Zeal. I walk with the Blade, the Shield, the Temptation, and the Shadow. We are the devoted—five priests determined to serve our gods in any way they demand—but the divine holds no power over men who don't believe. Faith offers little to those who think they are the ones who should be worshipped.</p> <p>Gods want love. Men want power. Everyone knows temptation.</p> <p>To save Zeal, I'm tempted to destroy everything...even our traditions.</p> <p>The Path of Temptation series features a strong woman and the men who love her. Graphic language, adult situations, and potentially triggering violence that are suitable for a mature audience are included.</p> <p><i>This is a love story, and while difficult topics are included, they are handled as respectfully as possible, because sometimes finding love isn't easy. Possible triggers include discussions of rape and assault, domestic violence, bullying, suicide, harassment, consensual pain and battery, shaming, sexual sadism, minor violence, and more adult themes.</i></p>";
