window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>A morte e ritorno.</i> My family’s motto circles in my mind as I look this problem dead on and try to figure it out. I’ve faced worse than this. Survived worse odds than this. I won’t let this failure break me.</p> <p>We have 72 hours to turn this around. Seventy-two hours to make a new plan out of the dregs of the old. Seventy-two hours until all hope is lost. This task is impossible, but I still like my chances. I have an ace in my pocket, and his name is Mason Cain. He might not want to help me, but I don’t plan on giving him a choice in the matter.</p> <p>My name is Rosalie Oscura. And I refuse to let anything beat me.</p> <p>This series is set in the world of Solaria five years after Zodiac Academy and 10 years after <i>Dark Fae</i>, and book one was previously published as <i>Darkmore Penitentiary</i>. There is some character crossover, but all series can be listened to independent of each other without spoilers. The female lead will end up with more than one love interest.</p>";
