window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Someone is killing werewolves. At least, that's the way Vincent Van Gogh tells it when he shows up at Mark Abernathy's art gallery seeking protection. For gallery assistant and art history addict Hanna Harvey, meeting Van Gogh is a dream come true—until death follows the troubled artist to town and Hanna becomes the murderer's next target.</p> <p>When Alpha Wereboss Mark Abernathy goes missing, a new wave of murders draws the attention of drool-worthy Detective James Morrison, further complicating Hanna's epic dating dilemma. Only absinthe-swilling bodyguard Toulouse Lautrec stands between Hanna and the malevolent murderer whose grudge runs deep and appears to be connected to the mystery of her bloodline.</p> <p>Damning evidence convinces Morrison that saving Hanna's life requires ending Abernathy's, and she's forced to choose between protecting the man who holds the key to her past, or spilling her secrets to the detective who could promise her a future.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
