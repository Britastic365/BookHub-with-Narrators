window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Fortuna has made one too many sacrifices to protect the ones she loves. She no longer knows how to go about her day-to-day life like she’s normal. Like she’s not utterly destroyed. Just a glimpse of Ian O’Connell’s face causes panic attacks, and Collith isn’t much help, considering he’s fighting demons of his own. Among so much inner turmoil, Fortuna’s abilities are still changing. However weak she feels, she knows she’s getting stronger. Fortuna does her best to hide it from other Fallen because, in the world of monsters, strength will get you killed. Well, that and unpredictable panic attacks. Unfortunately for Fortuna, it’s when you’re most vulnerable that enemies - new and old - like to come out of the woodwork....</p>";
