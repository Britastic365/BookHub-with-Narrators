window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Number-one <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author J. R. Ward delivers the second novel in her Bourbon Kings series - a sweeping saga of a Southern dynasty struggling to maintain a façade of privilege and prosperity while secrets and indiscretions threaten its very foundation....</b> </p> <p>In Charlemont, Kentucky, the Bradford family is the crème de la crème of high society - just like their exclusive brand of bourbon. And their complicated lives and vast estate are run by a discrete staff who inevitably become embroiled in their affairs. This is especially true now, when the apparent suicide of the family patriarch is starting to look more and more like murder.... </p> <p>No one is above suspicion - especially the eldest Bradford son, Edward. The bad blood between him and his father is known far and wide, and he is aware that he could be named a suspect. As the investigation into the death intensifies, he keeps himself busy at the bottom of a bottle - as well as with his former horse trainer's daughter. Meanwhile the family's financial future lies in the perfectly manicured hands of a business rival, a woman who wants Edward all to herself. </p> <p>Everything has consequences; everybody has secrets. And few can be trusted. Then, at the very brink of the family's demise, someone thought lost to them forever returns to the fold. Maxwell Bradford has come home. But is he a savior...or the worst of all the sinners? </p>";
