window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>I thought I could outrun my past, but some truths are impossible to escape.</b></p> <p>For years, I've hidden from the shadows that haunt me, but fate has a way of catching up. Now, my world has unraveled, and the secrets I've uncovered are forcing me to confront the person I was always meant to be.</p> <p>A witch. A Keeper. A woman with five fated mates I never expected to find.</p> <p>Together, we've faced danger, betrayal, and the unknown, but the greatest challenge lies within me. Unlocking the full strength of my power means facing my fearsâ€”and the truth of my soul. Because only by embracing who I truly am can I protect the bonds I've forged and the future we're fighting for.</p> <p>But nothing comes without a price, and destiny always demands its due.</p> <p>Witch Soul <i>is the second book in The Witchblood Legacy and is a standalone why-choose romance where the heroine does not have to choose between her mates. It has an HEA for this harem but is part of a bigger plotline and best enjoyed in order.</i></p>";
