window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Dominic</b> </p> <p>I was the boy who would never be king. The monster who could never be loved. Gia was just a job. Just another girl caught in a world of monsters. It didn't matter that I liked the look of her. I didn't care that she cringed when she saw my soul. </p> <p>I liked it. I liked her fear. And I wanted her. </p> <p>Monsters didn't get to live happily ever after, though. I knew one day I'd have to go back. Because time neither forgave nor forgot. </p> <p>And neither did I. </p> <p>Old debts needed to be settled. Enemies punished. It was past time I returned to the family business. I'd been gone far too long. </p> <p><b>Gia</b> </p> <p>All my life, I believed in fairy tales. Not the Disney kind. Never those. I always knew life was darker than that. I was the daughter of a foot soldier. The sister of a snitch. A nobody. </p> <p>Monsters had been part of my life for as long as I could remember, but none as dark as Dominic Benedetti. None as cruel. None as broken. </p> <p>I had no illusions about what he was. I had no desire to save his soul. And I couldn't care about his bleeding heart. </p> <p>But love isn't always beautiful. It could be a twisted, ugly bitch. </p> <p>I'd always known this was the kind I'd find. The only kind that could touch me. Because some of us, we belonged in the dark. </p> <p>And Dominic and I belonged in the dark. </p>";
