window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Cathy and Will are now the Duchess and Duke of Londinium, the biggest Fae-touched Nether city, but they have different ideas of what their authority offers. Pressured by his Fae patron, Lord Iris, Will struggles to maintain total control whilst knowing he must have a child with his difficult wife. Cathy wants to muscle the Court through 200 years of social change and free it from its old-fashioned moral strictures. But Cathy learns just how dangerous it can be for a woman who dares to speak out. </p> <p>Meanwhile, as Sam learns more about the Elemental Court, it becomes clear that the Fae are not the only threat to humanity. Sam realizes that he has to make enemies of the most powerful people on the planet or risk becoming the antithesis of all he believes in. Threatened by secret societies, hidden power networks, and Fae machinations, can Sam and Cathy survive long enough to make the changes they want to see in the world? </p>";
