Which is fine – he likes being ignored and he’s good at making drinks. Until one day an alien hears him singing and recruits him to become a god. Now Phex is thrust headfirst into the galaxy’s most cutthroat entertainment industry, where music is visible, the price of fame can kill, and the only friends he has want to be worshiped.<br> <br> Welcome to the divinity. Where there is no difference between celebrity and religion, love and belief, acolyte and alien. Where the right kind of obsession can drive a person crazy or turn them divine.</p> <p>Becky Chambers meets <i>The Voice</i> in the first of the Tinkered Starsong trilogy in which the mysterious Dyesi are trying to take over the universe, but they’re doing it so beautifully we might just let them.</p>";
