window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Mirror, mirror, on the wall...who's the baddest (w/b)itch of all?</p> <p>I wasn't ever into fortune telling. Thought it was all B.S. But a new witch showed up in town... and she's offered to teach me a few things... I had a little time on my hands. So I figured... what the hell? Why not? But what I saw when I gazed into that damn crystal... I saw my own end... my death... my final death. And the witch tells me that once it's divinized, it shall come to pass. You want to know what I have to say about that? F*** that S***!</p> <p>Bloody Fortune is the ninth book in The Fury of a Vampire Witch. You've met Mercy before in The Legacy of a Vampire Witch and The Blood Witch Saga. She's fought against devils and demons, insidious witches, and old-world vampires. When she returns to Exeter, where she grew up as a girl, she'll find enemies even bigger and badder than anything she's ever faced before.</p> <p>A great series for fans of the True Blood / Sookie Stackhouse novels or the Underworld franchise to sink their fangs into. The Fury of a Vampire Witch features a dark and twisty romance, action that could even get a vampire's heart pumping, and a snarky badass heroine.</p>";
