The spice is high, the characters intense, and the plot will keep you guessing until the bitter end. This is the filthy, gritty, angsty soap opera you never knew you needed. Welcome to The Marriage Auction.</p> <p><b>Meet the candidates:</b></p> <p>Maia Rhodes–A twenty-four-year-old pickpocket with a tragic past and one goal: Do whatever it takes to secure enough money to save her family from the devil and his spawn back home…even marry a stranger.</p> <p>Memphis Taylor–A college footballer who had big dreams of playing for the NFL but dropped out of college due to an injury. He needs to make enough money to help support his five sisters, his parents, and his sassy granny. What’s three years of his life?</p> <p>Summer Belanger–A Californian cannabis farmer with an unorthodox family, a witchy faith, and a desire to find her life’s purpose. As a horticulturist, she finds solace and peace in plants and nature but doesn’t know the first thing about running a successful business. Her kookie parents suggest the auction so she can find a businessman who will help her succeed and also handle her pesky lack of orgasms.</p> <p>Julianne Myers–Was raised in the lap of luxury, until her parents and their best friends were killed, leaving her brother and her childhood crush their empires. Her brother and his new fiancée attempt to take it all. Lost and utterly alone, Jules enters into the auction in order to make a huge amount of money fast.
