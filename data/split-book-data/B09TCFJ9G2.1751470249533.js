He's playing games with me, but I don't mind a challenge.</p> <p>Only problem is, I'm supposed to pledge myself to a rival vampire family and now all I can think about is Bran Duval, black sheep of the Duval vampire family, and the wicked things he's promising to do to me in the dark.</p> <p><b>Note:</b> Hot Vampire Next Door is first and foremost a Kindle Vella serial. This version is a boxset of episodes 1-18. It is considered ongoing and does not have a scheduled end date.
