Surrounded by my family's mortal enemies, trying to learn spells most five-year-olds can perform, and getting flustered over guys who turn into mythical beings.</p> <p>The worst thing: I don't even mind that much. Because as terrifying as this new world is, these three men make it worthwhile.</p> <p>With every look, every touch, every kiss, I get more addicted.</p> <p>Until the moment my old life catches up with me, bringing dangers I never saw coming. Everything I've worked to build might shatter with one false move.</p> <p>Unless I figure out how to be the witch I was meant to be.</p>";
