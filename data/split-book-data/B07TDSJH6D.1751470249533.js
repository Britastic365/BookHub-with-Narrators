Preferably someone with brains and brawn who can watch her back. Special Forces Sergeant Carlos Espinosa is more than happy to escort the beautiful, brilliant diplomat - who just might be a CIA case officer - to the party. Their night together only gets hotter when he discovers Kaylea burns for him too.</p> <p>Date night in Djibouti turns deadly when foreign agents target the couple. But who is the intended victim, the covert operator or the Green Beret? As Carlos and Kaylea use their combined skills to escape their captors, they uncover treachery that could ignite relations between the US and Djibouti - already at a flashpoint - and trigger an inferno.</p>";
