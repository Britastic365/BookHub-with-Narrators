window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>First comes hate. Second comes a forced marriage. And third, comes bringing Vitaly Melnikov to his knees.</b></p> <p><b>Vitaly</b></p> <p>I'm used to women wanting me, not hating me, but my wife looks at me like she's hoping my next breath will be my last.</p> <p>Our marriage wasn't by choice, but when I vowed to be her husband, I meant it. I never go back on my word, so we're married whether she likes it or not. At least for the moment.</p> <p>The plan was for me to stay married until we got what we needed from her brothers. As long as I don't touch her, we can annul this unfortunate blip on my bachelor timeline. The problem is she looks sweet, and she smells sweet, and then I risk everything and take a taste.</p> <p>Now, I'm addicted, and in way over my head.</p> <p><b>Katya</b></p> <p>My brother is head of the Lebedev Bratva, and he's just offered me to Vitaly Melnikov. It's a marriage that will unite our families, but it's not what I want. I don't care how incredibly good-looking my new husband isâ€”I don't trust him.</p> <p>I tell myself I can resist him, but the man is talented in ways I never dreamed of, and my restraint is slipping fast. Before I know it, I'm begging for more and falling hard for the husband I swore I'd never want.</p> <p><i>This is the fourth book in the Melnikov Bratva series. Each book features a different brother, and although each love story will be complete, the storyline started in the first book will not be completed until the last. These books should be listened to in order in order. This is a very steamy dark Bratva romance for mature listeners.</i></p>";
