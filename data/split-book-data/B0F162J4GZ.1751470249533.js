window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>What happens when you die, become the Grim Reaper's lawyer, then tie your soul with that same Grim Reaper forever? Well, you certainly do not get peace.</p> <p>The relationships that Joyce worked hard to build begin to crumble as new revelations unfold. As Joyce tries to navigate her professional and personal life, Eden is faced with something even worse than before. Something that is stronger than a reaper and may be impossible to stop. Someone who is the beginning and may very well be the end. An entity who everyone should fearâ€”God.</p> <p>With the fate of the Living World and Eden in their hands, Joyce and Aiden must team up with someone unexpected to prevent God from destroying everything. This time around, the fight may very well be outside the courtroom with fate as the judge. Will they save Eden and the Living World from its very own creator? Or will God take back what they rightfully own?</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
