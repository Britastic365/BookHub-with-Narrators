window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>He binds me in red ribbons and says my safe word is ‘mistletoe.’ On Christmas Eve, a masked Alpha breaks into my home. He’s been stalking me, he says. Following my every move. He knows everything about me—how high my mortgage is, how little I earn at my soul-destroying customer service job. What kind of shameful secrets I keep in my nightstand.</p> <p>How lonely I am.</p> <p>So, he gives me an offer I can’t refuse:</p> <p>Submit to him for one night, and he’ll pay off my home.</p> <p>After all, what’s one night of painful pleasure for longterm financial security?</p> <p>But I should have known never to trust an obsessed Alpha. Should have known that agreeing to his arrangement would only make him demand so much more than a single night of my reluctant submission. He bought my body. He won’t stop until he claims my heart, too.</p> <p>Holiday Intrusion is a dark, standalone romance set in the world of Alpha Ties.</p> <p>Note: This Christmas tale is darker than your average fare. Exclusively for listeners who like their eggnog with a side of rough dominance and (woefully inadequate) girth training…</p>";
