window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In </b><b><i>Fall for Him</i></b><b> by Andie Burke, seven-hundred-fifty square feet isn’t enough for the home-renovation-fueled hatred </b><b><i>and </i></b><b>the building sexual tension.</b></p> <p>Dylan Gallagher’s hot neighbor loathed him from the second he moved in, and causing a flood, falling through the floor, and landing directly onto that same neighbor’s bed probably means that’s unlikely to change. The poorly timed “It’s Raining Men” joke didn’t help.</p> <p>Meanwhile, ER nurse Derek Chang’s life is a literal when-rains-it-pours nightmare. A man he hates dropped into his life along with an astronomically expensive problem originating from Derek’s own apartment’s plumbing. Also, the local HOA tyrant has been sniffing around trying to fine him for his extended, illicit banned breed dog-sitting.</p> <p>Since Dylan also wants to keep the catastrophe quiet, he offers to fix the damage himself. Dylan’s sure he’s not Derek’s type, so he focuses all his ADHD hyper fixation energy on getting the repair job done as quickly as possible—avoiding doing anything stupid like acting on his very inconvenient crush. Meanwhile Derek tries to ignore that the tattooed nerd sleeping on the couch is surprisingly witty, smart, and kind, despite the long-term grudge Derek’s been holding against him. But will squeezing all their emotional baggage plus a dog into a tiny one-bedroom apartment be a major disaster…or just prove they’re made for each other? </p> <p><i>Fall for Him</i> combines banter, hijinks, and heart in a story of finding out what it means to fix things after your life crumbles.</p> <p><b>A Macmillan Audio production from St. Martin’s Press.</b></p>";
