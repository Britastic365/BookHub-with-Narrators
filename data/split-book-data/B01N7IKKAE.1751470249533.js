window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>New York Times</i> best-seller Jennifer Estep continues her Elemental Assassin urban fantasy series with a novella starring Silvio Sanchez, the vampire assistant of Gin Blanco, as he goes on a holiday date that turns out to be more deadly than romantic. </p><p>Working for Gin Blanco (aka the Spider, the assassin who runs the Ashland underworld) doesn't leave much time for romance, especially with Gin's holiday party planning in full swing. But when he catches the eye of a charming gentleman, Silvio finds himself going out for coffee. </p><p>All's fair in love and war, though. Just as Silvio is starting to enjoy himself, he realizes he's being watched. His nice guy date doesn't sense the danger, and Silvio wants to keep it that way (and, well, keep the guy alive), so Silvio ends the date early - only to be abducted by some villainous giants. Will Silvio survive the night and make it back to the Pork Pit in time for Gin's holiday party? Only if he decks the hall with bodies. </p>";
