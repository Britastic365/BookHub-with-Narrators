window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Guns n' Boys is a series about one couple, and needs to be listened to in order.</b> </p> <p>You can take a killer's memory, but not his instinct.</p> <p>All Seth wants is to live free with the man he loves. But escaping death at the hands of the mafia is just the beginning of an uphill struggle. When Domenico wakes up from his impromptu surgery and doesn’t even remember Seth’s name, Seth’s world falls apart. Suddenly it’s him who has to plan an escape from New York City and navigate their way to Mexico. All that without even knowing if the man of his life will ever love him again. </p> <p>Domenico doesn’t know who to trust and what to believe. The man who introduces himself as his brother seems to hide dark secrets behind a cheerful smile. With the mafia breathing down their necks, there is no time to piece together the puzzle of Domenico’s life, and each time he thinks he’s solved it, a new part appears to be missing. Dom needs to find out who he really is, what he’s capable of... and what is the real story hidden behind Seth’s intense eyes. </p> <p>Possible Spoilers: </p> <p><b>Themes:</b> mafia, homophobia, assassin, organized crime, amnesia, road trip, chase </p> <p><b>Genre:</b> Dark, twisted romance / crime thriller </p> <p><b>Warning:</b> Adult content. Sizzling hot scenes. If you are easily offended, this book is not for you. <br> <i>Guns n’ Boys</i> is a gritty story of extreme violence, offensive language, abuse, and morally ambiguous protagonists. Behind the morbid façade, there is a splash of inappropriate dark humor, and a love story that will crawl under your skin.</p>";
