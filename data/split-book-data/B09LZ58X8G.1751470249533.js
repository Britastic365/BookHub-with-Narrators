window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Brought to you by Penguin.</b><br> <br> <b>Over 1 million Discworld audiobooks sold – discover the extraordinary universe of Terry Pratchett’s Discworld like never before</b><br> <br> The audiobook of <i>Mort </i>is narrated by the BAFTA award-winning actor Sian Clifford (<i>Fleabag</i>; <i>Vanity Fair</i>; <i>Quiz</i>). BAFTA and Golden Globe award-winning actor Bill Nighy (<i>Love Actually</i>; <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i>; <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i>) reads the footnotes, and Peter Serafinowicz (<i>Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace</i>; <i>Shaun of the Dead</i>) stars as the voice of Death. Featuring a new theme tune composed by James Hannigan.<br> <br> <b>'YOU CANNOT INTERFERE WITH FATE. WHO ARE YOU TO JUDGE WHO SHOULD LIVE AND WHO SHOULD DIE?'</b><br> <br> Death comes to us all. When he came to Mort, he offered him a job.<br> <br> Death is the Grim Reaper of the Discworld, a black-robed skeleton with a scythe who ushers souls into the next world. He is also fond of cats and endlessly baffled by humanity. Soon Death is yearning to experience what humanity really has to offer, but to do that, he'll need to hire some help.<br> It's an offer Mort can't refuse. As Death's apprentice he'll have free board, use of the company horse-and being dead isn't compulsory. It's a dream job-until Mort falls in love with Death's daughter, Ysabell, and discovers that your boss can be a killer on your love life...<br> <br> The Discworld novels can be enjoyed in any order, but <i>Mort</i> is the first book in the Death series.<br> <br> The first book in the Discworld series - <i>The Colour of Magic </i>- was published in 1983. Some elements of the Discworld universe may reflect this.<br> <br> </p>";
