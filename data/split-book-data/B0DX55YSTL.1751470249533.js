window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After throwing a well-deserved hex at a human, 27-year-old Lex is required to return to her coven to await trial. Is it coincidence or fate that she returns to her hometown on the one night a year that a Briar Coven witch can summon her fated mate? But Lex has avoided partaking in the summoning for the last nine years, and she certainly has no intention of doing it this Samhain. Lex is determined to keep her head down and see out this trial...until she accidentally summons her mate...who just so happens to be an incubus demon.</p> <p>Lochran has grown tired of hunting for his meals. Like all the demons of his clan, he returns to the shadow realm on Samhain in the hope that this might be the year he will be summoned by his fated mate. Too bad that, when the smoke clears and the most beautiful witch he’s ever seen is glaring back at him, she’s telling him it was a mistake.</p> <p><i>Accidentally Summoned an Incubus</i> is a standalone story in the Briar Coven trilogy. Performed in DUET by Bridget and Jake Bordeaux.</p>";
