window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>They’re not quite enemies. Not really friends. More like frustrated balls of sexual tension, and neither will give in.</p> <p>Lance Gibson drives Mariah Malarkey absolutely crazy. He uses her office like a phone booth, and takes cupcakes from the corner of her desk like she baked them just for him. She didn’t. Maybe she knew the history teacher happened to love peanut butter icing, but that was purely a coincidence. All 16 times.</p> <p>Mariah has a way of getting under Lance’s skin, too. She calls him out on his crap, spoils him even if inadvertently, and, seeing the librarian in skirts, drives him wild. She won’t give in. It’s for the best, really, considering there’s no way he could lie to a woman like that, and he’s not about to tell her the truth about himself. Not in a million years. These two don’t hate each other. They don’t really like each other. But for this to be a friends-to-lovers story, they have to start somewhere, right?</p> <p>Note: This can be listened to as a standalone novel.</p>";
