window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"This is the thinking reader's romantic suspense, and it's dynamite.\" (<i>USA Today</i>) </p> <p>The man of her fantasies is finally hers. Sort of... </p> <p>Two things haunt forensic anthropologist Hazel MacLeod: the bones of victims of genocide she examines for her work, and former SEAL Sean Logan's rejection. But within days of moving to her cousin's estate to take a much-needed break, she finds herself faced with both. </p> <p>First, she's called in to examine a mass grave in Virginia; then, her politician cousin receives a threatening letter and insists Hazel needs around-the-clock protection - from none other than Sean Logan. To make matters worse, because the threat to her is classified, Hazel and Sean must pretend to be lovers to hide that he's her bodyguard. </p> <p>Sean has spent years trying to avoid his boss' sexy cousin, but now he's guarding her 24-7 and even bringing her as his date to a romantic destination wedding. As the heat between them intensifies, Sean can't lose sight of the danger that brought them together. But when bullets start flying, new questions arise. Are the senator's political rivals really behind the threat, or is someone trying to silence Hazel from speaking for the dead?</p>";
