window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>I’m a bounty hunter with a secret advantage....</i></b></p> <p>I’m the bounty hunter you call when you want the job done. But what people don’t know is that I’m a rare half-fae with the sort of powers the Unseelie will kill for. </p> <p>That’s why I let everyone think I’m human and I always work alone. Until now. Corbin Frost has been assigned to my latest case, and working with the Unseelie Enforcer - especially one who is a hybrid fae demon - isn’t going to be easy.</p> <p>He’s here because there are Fae markings on the dead body. The woman I’m tracking swears she’s innocent of her husband’s murder. She also claims to be human, but the evidence suggests otherwise. </p> <p>Basically, Corbin is my worst nightmare, and I can’t risk him finding out my true identity. It’s such a shame he’s so damn tempting....</p>";
