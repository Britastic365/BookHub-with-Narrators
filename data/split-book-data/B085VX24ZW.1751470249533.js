The end.</p> <p>So why is it every time she crosses his path that he has the urge to mess up her perfectly curled hair? Or unbutton a few of her prim and proper buttons?</p> <p>He knows he should stay away, yet like the high schoolers he’s around every day, he has no choice but to react first and think about the consequences later.</p> <p>Side note - bad decisions are made, leading to lapses in judgment that threaten both of their jobs. Yet when the time comes, neither one can seem to find the wherewithal to care. Why? Because being bad feels so good.</p>";
