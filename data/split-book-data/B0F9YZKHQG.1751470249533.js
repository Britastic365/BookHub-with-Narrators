Now, with the witch’s dark power swirling inside of him, he’s losing control of his monster and quickly making his way through my ship and my crew. It’s only me and Wendy Darling who can pull him back. But even we know time is running out.</p> <p>We steer my ship to Neverland where Vane, Roc’s little brother and one of Peter Pan’s Lost Boys, reveals there’s a way to fix Roc, but it requires a trip to Darkland.</p> <p>With Vane and Winnie in tow, we set sail to Roc’s home island. But not everything is as it seems on Darkland. Roc has allies <i>and</i> enemies lurking in the soot-stained streets, but it might be his past that catches up to him first.</p> <p>Roc can no longer run from who he is. But where does that leave Wendy and me?</p> <p>I may have lost my hand to the Crocodile, but I’m not willing to lose my heart too.</p> <p><i>Devour the Dark</i> is a MMF romantasy fairytale retelling.
