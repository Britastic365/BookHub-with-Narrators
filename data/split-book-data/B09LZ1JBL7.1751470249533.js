Featuring a new theme tune composed by James Hannigan.<br> <br> <b>'It's vital to remember who you really are . . . it isn't a good idea to rely on other people or things to do it for you, you see. They always get it wrong.'</b><br> <br> An eighth son of an eighth son is born, a wizard squared, a source of magic. A sourcerer.<br> <br> Unseen University, the Discworld's most magical establishment, has finally got its wish: the emergence of a wizard more powerful than ever before. You'd think they would have been a little more careful what they wished for . . .<br> <br> As the sourcerer takes over the University and sets his sights on the rest of the world, only one wizard manages to escape his influence. Unfortunately for everyone, it's Rincewind.<br> <br> Once again the cowardly wizard must embark on a quest: to deliver a precious artefact - the very embodiment of magic itself - halfway across the Disc to safety.

Some elements of the Discworld universe may reflect this.<br> <br> <b>'May well be considered his masterpiece . . . Humour such as his is an endangered species' </b><b><i>The Times</i></b><br> <br> <b>'One of our greatest fantasists, and beyond a doubt the funniest' George R.R. Martin</b></p>";
