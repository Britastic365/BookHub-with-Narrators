window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The road to Hell is paved with Yellow Bricks....</b><br> <br> I was perfectly single and content up until the wild winds brought me to this strange world of Oz. Suddenly I'm a hero who killed a wicked witch, and my dog, Toto, is startlingly human: a tall, gorgeous, dark-haired one at that, who's ready to ruthlessly protect me from all of the strange creatures along the Yellow Brick Road.<br> <br> Then the scarecrow showed up, a so called tin man, and a \"lion.\" They all want something from me, and I don't know if I can give it to them. Not with the Wicked Witch of the West hot on my ruby red heels. My only hope is that this Wizard everyone keeps talking about will break all of our curses. If he doesn't, I may just have to take matters into my own hands. Then they'll all be sorry.<br> <br> At least I'll be getting some cute shoes out of it.</p> <p><i>There's No Place Like Oz </i>is a reimagining of Wizard of Oz with a reverse harem twist. This darker, grittier version of a classic tale will keep you as on edge as our heroine, with touches of horror and lots of heat amidst the twisted romance. You'll love it if you prefer your enemies to lovers and your friends to lovers romances with multiple possessive, morally gray love interests who love to put their \"good girl\" to the test.</p>";
