window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Misha</p> <p>It's been three years since I met him, since he became my everything. Sure, we play with others - but for one night only. Until Geoff, my Sir, my love, fulfilled one of my role-play fantasies. Neither one of us expected that involving Lukas, Geoff's ex-lover and best friend, would give us both something we didn't know we needed. Now we just have to make it work, because instead of one man owning my heart, one man giving me a world filled with passion and desire, there are two.</p> <p>Geoff</p> <p>My life changed the moment I saw him. He was the boy I needed, the man I wanted, and it's been the just two of us ever since. Asking my best friend - a man I trust above all others - to help fulfill my boy's fantasy wasn't a hard decision. But now we're in a place I never thought we'd be. He's sharing our bed and stealing our hearts. But he's on the other side of the country, and we miss him every day.</p> <p>Lukas</p> <p>One weekend of fun wasn't supposed to change my whole world, but now, I have some decisions to make. How do I find my place in the hearts of two men who have loved each other for so long? Because one thing is clear: They both own mine completely.</p> <p><b>Contains mature themes.</b></p>";
