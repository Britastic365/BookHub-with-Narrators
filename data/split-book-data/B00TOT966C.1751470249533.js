He's spent his entire adult life dropping everything so he can take care of others. Now he's a father, a husband...and tired. His mate, Willow, knows Jasper won't let others know he might need a break even for a weekend, so that's where she comes in. </p> <p>Once Jasper lets go and allows his mate to call the shots, this beta might just be in for the ride of a lifetime. </p> <p>Author's note: This is a novella set between books six and seven, to give you a taste of Jasper and Willow.
