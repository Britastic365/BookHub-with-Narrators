But if they think I’m going to go quietly, or at all, they haven’t been paying attention to how I roll. </p> <p>Nightmare Penitentiary is the perfect place to escape, and I’m ready. If only people would stop trying to break me out. Seriously, it’s annoying. </p> <p>I’m ready to relax and serve my sentence, but then I meet the prison guard, Rook. I can’t seem to escape his heated stares, the head wobbles, or the dimples. Sweet pop rocks, the dimples! </p> <p>You’re not supposed to meet the male of your dreams in prison, but tell that to fate. Too bad I’m not as out of reach from the troubles hunting me down as I thought...and now, there’s nowhere to run because, like, I got myself imprisoned. FML.</p>";
