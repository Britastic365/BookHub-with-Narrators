window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From debut author Cassie Alexander comes a spectacular new urban fantasy series where working the night shift can be a real nightmare. </p> <p>Nursing school prepared Edie Spence for a lot of things. Burn victims? No problem. Severed limbs? Piece of cake. Vampires? No way in hell. But as the newest nurse on Y4, the secret ward hidden in the bowels of County Hospital, Edie has her hands full with every paranormal patient you can imagine - from vamps and were-things to zombies and beyond. </p> <p>Edie’s just trying to learn the ropes so she can get through her latest shift unscathed. But when a vampire servant turns to dust under her watch, all hell breaks loose. Now she’s haunted by the man’s dying words - Save Anna - and before she knows it she’s on a mission to rescue some poor girl from the undead - which involves crashing a vampire den, falling for a zombie, and fighting for her soul. Grey’s Anatomy was never like this. </p> <p>In addition to being a writer, Cassie Alexander is an active registered nurse in California. <i>Nightshifted</i> is her debut novel.</p>";
