When she's offered a new job as the sports therapist for a football (soccer) team, she jumps at the chance. This is just what she needs to leave the heartbreak and shame of Manchester behind, trading it in for the warmth and hopeful vibrancy of Madrid.</p> <p>Alejo Albarado is rising up the ranks in his career. As the charming forward for the Real Madrid team, Alejo's life revolves around women, parties, and being a tabloid darling, that is until the new sports therapist joins the team.</p> <p>Their passion could not be ignored. What starts out as a strictly professional relationship between Thalia and the young Spanish player, slowly evolves into something more. Much more.</p> <p>But their combustible chemistry and simmering sexual tension can only go so far-should Thalia give into Alejo's advances, she's at risk of not only losing her job, but succumbing to a younger man will drag her through the spotlight again.</p> <p>Alejo might be worth that risk. Unless he breaks her heart in the process.</p> <p><b>Contains mature themes.</b></p>";
