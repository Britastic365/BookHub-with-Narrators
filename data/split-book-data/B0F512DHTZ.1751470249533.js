window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>He's a halfling yearning for adventure. She's the vampire trying to keep him safe.</b></p> <p>Marius Wisethorn, Prince of Eleyta, has always wanted one thing: adventure. One night, the perfect opportunity falls in his lap. He intercepts a message about a feral, ancient vampire that has escaped its tomb and comes up with the perfect plan. He'll track down the First and kill it, proving to his sister that he's ready to explore the world.</p> <p>Vivienne Beaumont never expected her job as the halfling prince's bodyguard to be so much work. She's been a soldier for a century, and this should have been easy in comparison. She's wrong, though. The prince runs away on her first night, and suddenly, the blood vow she took to keep him safe mocks her. In an effort to keep him safe, she joins him on his foolish mission to stop the First.</p> <p>He's a magnet for trouble. She's just trying to keep him (and herself) alive. Neither expects to find love along the way.</p> <p><i>This is a standalone fantasy romance that takes place after </i>Tethered, Tormented, <i>and </i>Treasured. <i>It can be listened to on its own but is best enjoyed after the trilogy.</i></p>";
