window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A dark paranormal/fantasy romance from bestselling author, Sadie Kincaid.</p> <p>Every few millennia, a child is born.</p> <p>Some say they’re marked with a curse.</p> <p>Others claim they possess the power of the ages.</p> <p>Meet Ophelia Hart. Lover of classic literature and unicorns. An orphan with nobody in her corner—no family, no friends. But it’s her loneliness that fuels her life’s ambition to become a social worker and help the forgotten children just like her. For a foster kid with only slightly above-average grades, it feels like a pipe dream.</p> <p>Except it seems that someone is looking out for Ophelia after all. When an unexpected opportunity to attend Montridge University arises, she thinks her life is finally taking a turn for the better.</p> <p>Too bad she comes to the attention of the three ruthless, arrogant commanders of the Ruby Dragon Society. Three of the most feared and powerful vampires on campus.</p> <p>But Ophelia doesn’t believe in vampires. Or in witches, or magic, or ancient prophecies.</p> <p>Until she has no choice. Little does she know, she’s about to have her whole world turned upside down. Because there is something about Ophelia Hart. Something that captures not only the attention of the Ruby Dragon commanders, but also their powerful, enigmatic sire—Professor Alexandros Drakos.</p> <p>With no idea of the power running through her veins, Ophelia must learn to trust the very men whom all others fear. And she needs to do it fast, for there are darker forces at work than those at Montridge University. Forces that were long ago Forged in Blood.</p> <p>Forged in Blood is book one in a trilogy. Books 1 and 2 end on cliffhangers and book 3 is a HEA.</p>";
