window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Bob and Karen are, by all regards, an unhappily married couple who have tried desperately to rekindle an extinguished flame. Their last hope for reconciliation is a move across the pond to an old farmhouse by the sea. This farmhouse has problems that are much worse than the constant flooding and the shape of disrepair that shadow over it. It harbors dark secrets, hidden dangers, and a legacy of horrific murders that have followed the structure and those who have inhabited it for well over 100 years.</p> <p>Bob and Karen have barely survived one another throughout their marriage. Can they survive the terrors that dominate their land when the sun goes down? An epic tale of love and marriage blended with the fearful whispers of the <i>Book of Lucifer</i>, the zombie genre finds new life and a new definition in <i>She Rises at Night</i>.</p>";
