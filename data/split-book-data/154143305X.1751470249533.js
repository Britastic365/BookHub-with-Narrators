window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The most terrifying monsters aren't found in dreams....</b></p> <p>Four young socialites have gone missing in the Chicago area. Two found dead, bearing the signature marks of a brutal serial killer. With the kind of tragedy that mars Nola Tensley's past, she should be concerned, but without a pot to piss in, all the struggling single mom cares about is making a normal life for her son.</p> <p>After all, she's clearly not the murderer's type. Or is she?</p> <p>When Rhett Voss, an enigmatic and handsome stranger, answers her ad for the outdated in-law suite at the back of her property, offering double her asking price, Nola really can't refuse. Even though the supposed Wall Street Wolf seems better suited for a high-rise downtown - a suspicion that quickly turns into hindsight once she submits to the flirtations of her charming new tenant and, consequently, unearths a series of disturbing revelations.</p> <p>Her curiosities lead her down the path of a madman whose moniker, The Sandman, only hints at the grisly nature of his crimes. He's smart. Evasive. A cunning psychopath with a twisted method of disposing his victims.</p> <p>And his hunting grounds are hitting too close to home.</p> <p><b>Contains mature themes.</b></p>";
