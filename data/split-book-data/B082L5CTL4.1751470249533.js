window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From </b><b><i>NYT</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>USA Today</i></b><b> best-selling author Kym Grosso...a novel in the Immortals of New Orleans series, now optioned for film.</b></p> <p>Hunter Livingston’s trip to Hell had been a calculated risk. Best case scenario, the Alpha would save a friend and come out unscathed; at worst, he’d burn in flames for eternity. But finding the high priestess had never been part of his plan, nor was rescuing the near-dead stranger he'd found lying by her side. Drawn to the mysterious woman, he’d sworn to protect her from the rogue pack who sold her into Hell and the demon who sought her soul. </p> <p>With royal blood flowing through her veins, Dr. Willa Jacobs had long hidden her Lycan heritage. Deep within the rainforest, she’d unearthed a discovery that drew the attention of both humans and the forces of evil. Rescued by the charismatic Alpha, she’d known her kidnappers would never give up looking for her or her research. As the dominant Alpha stirred her beast to rise, her emotions warred, and she was more determined than ever to see her adversaries burn in Hell.</p> <p>From Wyoming to Louisiana, Hunter and Willa spiral into an erotic and dangerous journey where they question who is foe or friend, and must fight to destroy their enemies. As Willa grows closer to the sexy Alpha, will she divulge her true nature, embracing the strength of her abilities? If they survive, will Hunter claim his mate, accepting the hellfire that runs through her veins?</p> <p><b><i>Hunter </i></b><b>is written to be listened to as a stand-alone, but many listeners prefer to hear the series in order.</b></p>";
