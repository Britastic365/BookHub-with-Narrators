As an FBI agent, she has witnessed some very bad deeds committed by seemingly good people. That's why she's glad to see corrupt DEA Agent Nicole Rollins behind bars for murder, conspiracy, and gunrunning. But when Rollins makes a daring escape - jeopardizing a busload of children and killing five officers - Lucy becomes the key to the biggest manhunt in Texas history...and the target of a brilliant killer. </p> <p>\"The Lucy Kincaid/Sean Rogan novels just keep getting better!\" (RT Book Reviews)</p> <p>Some believe Rollins has fled the country. But Lucy suspects her plan is far more sinister - a taunting game of cat and mouse that hits much closer to home. First, an FBI agent with a connection to Texas is killed in Washington. Then, Kane Rogan disappears on a mission. When Rollins ups the ante again, Lucy is determined to save the people she loves - before her enemy strikes again. Time is running out. The body count is rising. Rollins wants more than revenge-she wants to destroy everything Lucy holds dear....</p>";
