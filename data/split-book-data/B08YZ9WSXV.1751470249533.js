window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>This time, helping a ghost might kill her.</b></p> <p>Victoria Cage has one main objective in life: make sure that no one finds out she’s a necromancer. You know, a carrier of that pesky little power that caused zombies to rise back in World War III?</p> <p>Of course, it’s hard to stay hidden when you deal with dead bodies. Like, every freaking day.</p> <p>Maybe, taking over the family funeral home wasn’t the smartest choice in the world, but sometimes, being the local mortician and resident \"crazy pants\" has its benefits. Like...when Victoria’s caught talking to thin air, folks just dismiss it as her own brand of strange. I mean, what person in the business of death isn’t a little weird? </p> <p>When a murder victim reanimates on her embalming table, Victoria is drawn into an unfinished business that puts her to the ultimate test. It yanks her in like a fish on a sharp shiny hook, until she’s knee-deep in a cocktail of blood magic, death power, and fairy meddling.</p> <p>Talk about complicated.</p> <p>Fans of Hamilton’s Merry Gentry series and Briggs’ Mercy Thompson series will fall in love with this world that mixes a little bit of this, a little bit of that, and a lot of kick-ass, relatable necromancer in size 12 jeans. And don’t worry, there are enough sexy AF men to go around.</p> <p><b>Warning: </b>sex and language</p> <p>Victoria Cage has sex. People around her curse. There are dead people sprinkled between instances of profanity (okay, maybe the language isn’t that bad). The Victoria Cage series will also deal with some heavy material - child trafficking, gender acceptance, rape. If you can take the dark with the light, you might just love this series. </p>";
