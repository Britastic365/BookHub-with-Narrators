window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Olive Maxwell much prefers teaching about the Supernatural world to taking part in it and leaves the magical shenanigans to her two sisters. After assigning her college students a project designed to nudge them outside their comfort zones, Olive realizes she’s never once stepped a toe out of her own—and it’s about time that changed.</p> <p>Her first trip into the unknown? Moving in with her longtime crush and friend: tattooed, motorcycle-riding, and pleasantly pierced Baxter Donovan.</p> <p>Bax Donovan, Guardian Angel not-so-extraordinaire, has acquired so many black marks on his record it looks like a Scantron test. He’s been given one last chance to keep his Guardian wings, a high-profile Assignment he knows all too well. Olive is usually as low-risk as it gets. Hell, she wrote the safety manual.</p> <p>But something landed her on the Guardian Angel Affairs radar, and he guesses it has something to do with the heart-pounding stunts she’s determined to check off her Dare I Docket list. Keeping Olive out of trouble is about to be his toughest Assignment. He’s at real risk of shattering the only Guardian Angel code of conduct rule he’s yet to break: don’t fall in love with your Assignment. And he isn’t so sure that’s a bad thing.</p>";
