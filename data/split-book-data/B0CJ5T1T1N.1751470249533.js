window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>My thoughts, my drive, and my goal were all focused on one thing. I was a madman obsessed, and nothing would get in my way.</b></p> <p>Treasure. For centuries, it has been the drive for humans to lie, murder, cheat, and steal, and the Nectar is the biggest fortune of them all. An object that can change the dynamics between fae and humans, giving humans fae-like qualities.</p> <p>Thousands of people are now searching for it, and enemies great and small are on the hunt. Tracking down Katrina into the ancient dragon caves, the group sinks deeper into greed, death, and betrayal from foes who have been lurking in the shadows—nightmares from the past who still haunt Croygen.</p> <p>When the Nectar slips through their fingers, their chase takes them to the destitute streets of Budapest, where the divide between humans and fae is brewing, and leads Katrina to an old childhood friend. Someone who would have fought the world and killed any enemy for her. Now, she is the enemy.</p> <p>Choosing between love and her soul, Katrina will make the ultimate choice that will change all their lives forever, setting a domino effect into the future.</p> <p>You should know never to trust a pirate. They seek revenge, battle for vengeance, and kill with cruelty. Puss and her Pirate will rise the seas and hunt for those who have betrayed them.</p> <p>Yo Ho. Welcome to the world of scavengers and cutthroats.</p>";
