window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Caught in a love triangle, a strong-willed woman bent on vengeance aligns herself with two men she doesn't quite trust—but can't stop thinking about—in this action-packed, suspenseful romance.</b></p> <p>Raised by con artists, Ellie Watt has a lot of crazy childhood memories—but none crazier than being scarred with acid by the demented crime boss Travis Raines. Now Ellie is a full-grown woman who lives for revenge, and Travis is a full-blown drug lord who kills for pleasure. The sadistic bastard has kidnapped her good friend Gus as well as her mother, whom he's been holding as prized possessions in his heavily guarded lair. And Ellie has only one chance in hell of getting them out alive—using two dangerous men who love her to death . . .</p> <p>One is Camden McQueen, a talented tattoo artist who's made a permanent mark on Ellie's heart. The other is Javier Bernal, her fiery ex-lover who's busted more than a few heads in his time. From the crime-ridden streets of Mexico City to the predatory jungles of Honduras, this unlikely trio forms an uneasy alliance in the deadliest game of all-a gun-blazing battle to the finish that will pit enemy against enemy and lover against lover. And Ellie must choose the right man to trust . . . or die.</p>";
