She's agreed to undertake the Trial of the Broken, a rite of passage every member of her father's House must pass. It offers a path to independence and freedom that is too tempting to deny. </p> <p>Not everyone welcomes this lost daughter of Roake. There are those who fear what her presence might bring to light. Betrayal stalks the halls of Kira's birthplace-its roots embedded deep in the events that claimed her parent's lives and set her on her current path. </p> <p>Walking the wire's edge between truth and deception will test the person Kira has become as she separates ally from betrayer. An old enemy has put into motion a plan that could topple the balance of power in the universe. Letting them succeed spells doom - but the price might be more than Kira is willing to pay.</p>";
