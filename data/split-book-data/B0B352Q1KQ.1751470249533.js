window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Two novellas from Kennedy Ryan's critically acclaimed Hoops Series!</b></p> <p><b><i>Full-Court Press (</i></b><b>Avery + Deck's story)</b></p> <p>MacKenzie Decker was a question Avery never got to ask, much less an answer. They met when she was a young reporter fueled by ambition, and the ink on Deck's first NBA contract was barely dry. Years later, they've climbed so high and lost so much, but one thing hasn't changed—the attraction that simmered between them in a locker room before is still there. With success like theirs, everything has been possible...except them. But that was then.</p> <p>The only question is...what about now?</p> <p><b><i>Fast Break</i></b><b> (Quinn + Ean's story)</b></p> <p>Quinn was a world-class runner once.</p> <p>My dreams had wings spun from wind and speed. Every time out of the blocks was a glorious flight. But then, I crashed and burned. When I lost my leg, I thought it was the finish line. Little did I know life was just beginning. Now they call me “America’s titanium sweetheart.” (What can I say? It tested well. LOL) The life I thought was over is moving so fast. I have my own gym, a fitness app, a clothing line, and an endless trail of endorsements. One thing there’s never time for? Love. One thing I don’t have time for? Games. Come real, or don’t come at all. In a field full of players, I’m looking for a real one. Otherwise, I won’t stop.</p> <p>Ean had hoops dreams.</p> <p>I wanted to be like Mike, jump like magic and soar like Dr. J. But a college injury grounded me. What I thought was game over, actually opened up a whole new world. Fast forward to now, I’m coaching some of the NBA’s best. They call me \"the machine\" because I’m obsessed with stats and data, and my near-photographic memory means I remember every play. I see the court clearly. But I never saw her coming. Quinn Barrow stops me in my tracks. Pursuing my first championship, there’s been no time for love. I’m more than willing to chase her, but will she slow down long enough to be caught? </p>";
