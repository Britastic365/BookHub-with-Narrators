window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>A saga that sweeps from 1700's Egypt to Nazi Germany. Shifters and Romani hate each other, but they hate vampires more. Maybe it's time to forge a new alliance. </i></p> <p><i>Tarnished Beginnings</i> (Book 1)</p> <p>Tairin Jabari was born in a caravan and has always believed she's Romani. Why wouldn't she? Her mother and father never suggested otherwise. The Rom have harsh rules. When Tairin's first shift catches her unaware at 13, her father disappears, and the elders move with deadly speed to punish her mother for mating outside the blood. </p> <p><i>Tarnished Legacy</i> (Book 2)</p> <p>Half Romani, Tairin's no stranger to hiding her mixed blood from gypsy caravans. What she can't hide is her perpetual youth, courtesy of her shifter heritage. Every few years, she drops out of sight, resurfacing in a new country to join a caravan where no one knows her. She's overstayed her welcome where she is, but Germany is at war, and travel has become all but impossible for everyone targeted by the Reich. </p> <p><i>Tarnished Prophecy</i> (Book 3)</p> <p>Magic runs strong in Ilona, a gypsy seer. Powerful ability isn't valued in Romani women, so she focuses her fortunetelling on inconsequential details. Nothing that could come back to haunt her caravan if a prediction went bad. Rounded up and dumped in Dachau prison camp, she has plenty of time to rue her decision to downplay her ability. If she'd taken the time to scry her own future, she'd still be free. </p> <p><i>Tarnished Journey</i> (Book 4)</p> <p>Long before Germany rounded up Romani and sent them to prison camps, the Netherlands declared them undesirables. Yara's caravan disbanded when she was 15 to avoid being driven out of the country. Ten years have passed, and she's been alone for most of that time hiding in caves and abandoned buildings. It's been a lonely life, but at least she still has one.</p>";
