When the next offering is due and the monstrous Duskwalker is seen heading their way, her village offers her an impossible choice—be thrown into the prison cells or allow herself to be sacrificed to a faceless monster.</p> <p>However, he is not what he seems. His skull face and glow eyes are ethereal, and she finds herself unwittingly enchanted by him.</p> <p><b>All Orpheus ever wanted was a companion.</b></p> <p>Each decade, in exchange for a protection ward from the Demons that terrorize the world, Orpheus takes a human offering to the Veil—the place he lives and the home of Demons. The brief companionship does little to ease his loneliness, and their lives were always, unfortunately, cut short.</p> <p>He'd thought it was a hopeless endeavor, until he met her. She’s not afraid of him, and his insatiable desire deepens within every moment of her presence.</p> <p>But will Orpheus be able to convince Reia to stay before she’s lost to him forever?</p>";
