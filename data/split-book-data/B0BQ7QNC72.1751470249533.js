window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>He’s a massive, mocking, murderous monster. And she's offering him...everything.</b></p> <p>In a world of recently warring orcs and men, Maria is desperate for escape. She’s trapped in an opulent prison, tainted by rumours of madness, and wed to a cold, vindictive duke who hungers only for war.</p> <p>But with no family, no funds, and no hope, there’s nowhere left to run—except for the one place even a duke can’t reach. The place where women almost always meet their doom: Orc Mountain.</p> <p>It’s a grim, deadly fortress, filled with fierce, bloodthirsty beasts. The first orc Maria meets is the most terrifying of them all. A huge, hostile, hideous brute, hardened by hatred and war, who instantly accuses her of foul trickery, and threatens her with death.</p> <p>But this orc also wants something...something that kindles deep in his gleaming black eyes, in his rough, rugged scent, in the velvet heat of his voice. Something that just might grant Maria his safety…but only if she grants him <i>everything</i> in return.</p> <p>Her defeat.</p> <p>Her dignity.</p> <p>Her devotion.</p> <p>Surely a duchess wouldn’t dare make such a shameful deal with the devil—or would she? Especially when surrender might spark yet more war...or bring the mighty Orc Mountain to its knees.</p> <p>A dark, angsty, full-length fantasy romance. Comes after<i> The Librarian and the Orc </i>in the Orc Sworn series, but also acts as a standalone. Happily ever after guaranteed.</p>";
