window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>He’ll do anything to find his mate! Calix has been looking for his mate for years. There’s someone fated just for him, and no one else will do. But one look at Emma has Cal overwhelmed with protectiveness. He knows Emma is not the one, but that doesn’t stop him from stealing her and claiming her as his own.</p> <p>Emma stinks.</p> <p>Stinking is ideal for avoiding attention. But when it comes to the hot-as-sin alien mercenary who just rescued her from slavery, that’s the last thing she wants. Emma wants her muscle-bound hero, lock, stock, and barrel. Instead, he dumps her in the spare room to “keep her safe.” What a bummer!</p> <p>But the more time they spend with each other, the more they realize they are perfect together. Will Calix give up his hunt for a mate to claim the female he loves? Or will Emma leave him in a misguided attempt to help him find his one true mate?</p> <p>Can be listened to as a stand-alone or as part of the series. Growly mercenary and steamy scenes ahead. HEA guaranteed.</p>";
