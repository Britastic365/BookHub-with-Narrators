window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Can a marriage of convenience turn into true love? Maybe...with the help of the right man.</b></p> <p>Quinn has made mistakes - like sleeping with the wrong people. It’s taken him time to figure out what he wants in bed and out of it. Understandable, since he’s attracted to both men and women and surrounded by a network of friends who seem to have no trouble finding love in any combination. </p> <p>When he meets Trevon - the sexiest man ever - on the side of the road, only one thing keeps Quinn from pursuing him: Trevon’s even sexier wife, Devra. </p> <p>Like Quinn, Trevon and Devra have led rough lives. Financial and safety concerns forced them into a marriage of convenience they both secretly wish was more. </p> <p>The lessons Quinn’s past taught him should put the brakes on his fantasies of propositioning Trevon and Devra for a one-night ménage. But the need to atone for his previous transgressions, along with pure temptation, drives him to bring the struggling couple closer, even if it means breaking his own heart in the process. </p> <p>This is a stand-alone book in the Hot Rides series and includes a happily ever after with no cheating. The series is part of the greater universe where both the Powertools and Hot Rods books are also set, so you can visit many of your previous favorite characters and see what they’re up to now!</p>";
