window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>For over a year, I've been hiding from my ruthless mob boss father and lying to everyone around me.</b></p> <p>Jordan is a sweet, protective biker who thinks we eloped in Vegas the night we met. The truth is, he was just supposed to be my ticket out of my gilded prison.</p> <p>I had nowhere to go, so when Jordan asked me to live with him after we got to his home in Rockland, I reluctantly agreed. After that, it was impossible to resist falling in love with him.</p> <p>But every second we're together is ruined thanks to the agonizing guilt eating away at me. I know I should just tell Jordan the truth about who I am; I just don't want to lose him.</p> <p>When Jordan doesn't come home one night, my worst fears of losing him to a lie are nothing compared to the fear that he won't survive until morning. I would do anything to keep the man I love safe, even sell my soul to the monster holding him hostage.</p> <p>Eli is a nightmare of my father's creation. Now that he's found me, he's made it perfectly clear that he's taking every ounce of his hatred toward my father out on me and Jordan.</p> <p>I'm all too familiar with Eli's dark side. I hate to admit that I've even missed his rough treatment. Being at his mercy isn't as scary as he thinks it is. In fact, his particular methods of tormenting captives reveal that I'm not the only one in my fake marriage hiding secrets.</p> <p>It doesn't take me long to realize that Eli just wants to inflict pain on anyone who tries to get close to him because he has so many scars of his own.</p> <p>Even though he refuses to admit it, Jordan wants Eli as much as he wants me, despite his threats or how callously Eli treats him.</p> <p>And I just want to find a way to save the two men who own my heart, body, and soul from my father's wrath.</p> <p><i>Madison's book is the fourth and final book in the Sin City Mafia series. It is a dark and twisted MMF romance.</i></p>";
