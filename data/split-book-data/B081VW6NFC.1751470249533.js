But now that he’s gone and the truth about my past has been revealed, everything is different.</p> <p>I used to be a king. I lived my life shrouded by a lie. Afraid to take the love I desperately wanted - love from my queen as well as my knight. That fear is the reason I lost both of them. This is my second chance to be the man Gwen needs, to take up Excalibur and stop the apocalypse, and to finally accept who I truly am.</p> <p>I am Arthur Pendragon, at least, I was. In our past, I broke both Gwen and Lancelot. But this time, I’ll be the hero they each deserve.</p>";
