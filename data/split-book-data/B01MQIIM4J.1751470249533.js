They called him the lion, for his long, shoulder length hair and his ruthless reputation. </p> <p>Nico didn't have much use for reporters or journalists, but a fiction writer? And a beautiful one at that, who seemed to show signs that she might have some of the same...interests he had? How could he not take advantage of that? </p> <p>Publisher's disclaimer: a love story, completed by passion and discipline. </p>";
