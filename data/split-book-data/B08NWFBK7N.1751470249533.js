window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Love, in a hopeless place.</p> <p>Two months after a virus took out civilization, Rachel Donnelly is the last living soul in California, as far as she can tell. Until she runs into a Marine sniper, battle-hardened but alive and healthy.</p> <p>Adam Sanchez would love nothing more than a slamming session of I-can't-believe-we're-alive post-apocalyptic sex in the back of his Hummer. But Rachel's fragility, inexperience-and much younger age-hold him back from exposing her to his raw, aggressive sexuality. If anything, Rachel needs protection. Especially from himself.</p> <p>As they band together with other survivors to battle feral animals, violent ex-cons, and motorcycle clubs jockeying for power, Rachel grows stronger in mind, body, and spirit-strong enough to give the dangerously sexy Marine what they both crave.</p> <p>The power of their passion rocks Adam's world, bringing him to his knees-which, he discovers too late, is the worst possible place to be when danger springs from the shadows.</p> <p><b>Warning: </b>Contains a sexy Marine, a tattooed ex-con, a girl who blossoms into a sexually assured young woman, laughter despite the pain, m/f/m m√©nage, hope, love, and more bad language and violence than are strictly necessary.</p>";
