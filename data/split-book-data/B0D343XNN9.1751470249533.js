window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Ten years after the publication of </b><b><i>Annihilation</i></b><b>, the surprise fourth volume in Jeff VanderMeer’s blockbuster Southern Reach Trilogy.</b></p> <p>When the Southern Reach Trilogy was first published a decade ago, it was an instant sensation, celebrated in a front-page <i>New York Times</i> story before publication, hailed by Stephen King and many others. Each volume climbed the bestsellers list; awards were won; the books made the rare transition from paperback original to hardcover; the movie adaptation became a cult classic. All told, the trilogy has sold more than a million copies and has secured its place in the pantheon of twenty-first-century literature.</p> <p>And yet for all this, for Jeff VanderMeer there was never full closure to the story of Area X. There were a few mysteries that had gone unsolved, some key points of view never aired. There were stories left to tell. There remained questions about who had been complicit in creating the conditions for Area X to take hold; the story of the first mission into the Forgotten Coast—before Area X was called Area X—had never been fully told; and what if someone had foreseen the world after <i>Acceptance</i>? How crazy would they seem?</p> <p>Structured in three parts, each recounting a new expedition, there are some long-awaited answers here, to be sure, but also more questions, and profound new surprises. <i>Absolution </i>is a brilliant, beautiful, and ever-terrifying plunge into unique and fertile literary territory. It is the final word on one of the most provocative and popular speculative fiction series of our time.</p>";
