window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"Be a good girl for me, Mouse.\"</b></p> <p>Secrets are starting to come out about my past, and the only thing that feels real anymore is my annoyingly hot vampire neighbor, Bran Duval.</p> <p>He made me a promise to help me uncover my past, but I didn't know those promises included the heat of his touch. Bran and I don't always see eye to eye, but when we're alone together in the dark, everything feels right, even if some of the things he does to me might be <i>so very bad</i>.</p> <p>As my Pledge draws nearer, and more secrets come out, I can't help but wonder: Who am I? Or better yet, what am I?</p> <p><b>Listener Note: </b><b><i>Hot Vampire Next Door</i></b><b> is first and foremost a serial. </b>It is considered ongoing and does not have a scheduled end date. You can expect high heat, lots of twists, and a vampire who realizes he might be a little more protective of his little mouse than he first realized. Season two contains episodes 19-33.</p> <p>Please check the author's website for CWs.</p>";
