window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Charlie is gone, and Lincoln finds that Lichfield Towers offers no sanctuary. With reminders of her at every turn, and employees threatening to mutiny, he must try to find the murderer who is killing supernaturals on his own. And keep the murderer away from Charlie. </p> <p>When the strongman from the visiting Barnum and Bailey's circus is murdered, Lincoln suspects a link, but piecing together the clues becomes dangerous and difficult work. He can't afford to be distracted, yet he finds he can't concentrate fully on the task. Even worse, Seth's mother, the incomparable Lady Vickers, has come to stay. </p> <p><i>Ashes to Ashes</i> is a bonus novella-length story told entirely from Lincoln's point of view. It is shorter than the rest of the books in the Ministry of Curiosities series. </p>";
