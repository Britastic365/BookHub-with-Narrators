window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Original score by Danny Schade </p> <p>Welcome to Wheel: a perfect world without poverty, disease, or want. Tinkered and tuned in every way for maximum order by Rank and Spoke, every child knows her destiny - so long as she can take the neural implant. </p> <p>The defective, whose bodies reject the implants, do not exist. Ghosts. Cyphers. Haunting the edges of society, living on scraps, killed for sport. A lucky few, the Crudrats, scrape out a perilous living cleaning the toxic wastes from the great machines that power the station. </p> <p>Meet Maura. Cypher. Crudrat. Grown too tall, alone in a spaceport with no use for her, doomed to starve. With only her crud-eating murmel and an alien monster to help her, she must find a way to survive, or escape, before they catch her and blow what's left of her life, and her companions, into space. </p> <p>From the pen of Gail Carriger, ArtisticWhispers Productions presents an unabridged full-cast young-adult adventure that brings golden age-style science-fiction into the 21st century, stuffs it full of heart and gives it a finely polished, gleaming edge. </p>";
