window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Poisoned. Trapped. At the mercy of a ghost.... She can handle this.</p> <p>A month into her competition with Venator Terryn, Ayleth seems no closer to winning the Golden Prince's trust. Why else would he call Terryn to serve at the castle on some secret mission, leaving Ayleth to manage the borough on her own?</p> <p>No matter. She'll prove her worth to the prince come what may. Plenty of mysteries plague the land under her protection...including the mystery of Terryn himself and the strange, dangerous talisman he's been keeping hidden in his room.</p> <p>Her search for answers soon finds Ayleth on the trail of her deadliest foe yet. A ghost from the prince's past has returned to haunt the present, possessed of a powerful phantom shade capable of walking the dark paths of the Haunts. Ayleth is totally outmatched and unprepared to face such an enemy alone.</p> <p>But when has she ever backed down from a fight?</p>";
