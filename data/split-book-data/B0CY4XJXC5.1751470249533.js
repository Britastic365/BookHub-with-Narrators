window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>An impoverished spinster in love with a man who’s married to his job…and the twist of fate that makes it his job to protect her…</i></b><br><br>Madeleine Caruthers has been madly in love with her pastor for over a year, but (despite her conviction that the attraction is mutual) he’s made it clear he’s married to the church. So, when her friends summon her to Texas, she doesn’t think twice about signing on as a Pinkerton agent to help bring a dangerous cattle rustling gang to justice. As far as she’s concerned, women can marry their jobs, too.<br><br>Pastor Josh Michaelson hates the fact that he’s not in the position to court the lovely Madeleine, but he can’t stand the thought of dragging her into the dangers he faces every day as an undercover detective.<br><br>When she abruptly leaves town, he prays she’ll find someone out west who will love her and cherish her the way she deserves. He doesn’t expect to get called to work a case in Texas himself, nor does he (in his wildest dreams) expect to be asked to serve as the partner of the one woman he can’t stop thinking about.<br><br><i>SECOND EDITION: This book was previously part of The Pinkerton Matchmaker Series. It has since been revised, re-edited, and recovered to be a part of its own Western Brides Undercover Series.</i><br><br><b>Western Brides Undercover</b><br>An Agent for Bernadette<br>An Agent for Lorelai<br>An Agent for Jolene<br>An Agent for Madeleine</p>";
