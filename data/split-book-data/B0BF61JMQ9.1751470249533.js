window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Inspired by the myths and folktales about Asmodeus from <i>The Book of Tobit</i>.</p> <p><i>“Blood was spilled on the holy land, for the worst kind of lust was driven by the desire for God.”</i></p> <p>Lace, white, everything frilly and pretty. The theme to Sara’s life used to be that of a princess, one she romanticized. But when her previously perfect world turned upside down, Sara became convinced that she was cursed. She hid herself in the shadows to spare others from the agony she brought along.</p> <p>The only person she could never hide from was her adopted brother.</p> <p>Tristan Marcolf wasn’t the run-of-the-mill rich and successful politician. It was his ethereal good looks that left others bewildered. So much so, they wondered if his looks were a gift from God. Only the cursed gift gave Tristan everything he wished for, except for the one thing he truly desired.</p> <p>His adopted sister, Sara.</p> <p>Tristan unravels as Sara starts to slip out of his grasp and into the arms of another. With Tristan’s unquenchable thirst for her spiraling out of control, he gives into the demon inside and makes an unforgivable mistake; one he cannot take back.</p> <p>Loosely based on the story of Asmodeus, the Demon of Lust, who loved to play with mortals. Asmodeus orchestrated settings to prove to God that humans would choose pleasures of the flesh and materialistic desires over the simplicity of love. The two souls set out to prove him wrong and humble his vanity, but rarely do demons give in without a fight.</p> <p>There are no heroes in this book, only villains. It consists of explicit content and dubious and graphic situations that some listeners might find offensive.</p>";
