window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author Samantha Towle comes a new, sexy stand-alone novel about love, lies, and rock stars.</b></p> <p>The son of an icon.</p> <p>He was a legend. Rock royalty.</p> <p>A man I never met.</p> <p>But I’m measured against him in every aspect of my life.</p> <p>The only time I feel like me...the real me...is when I’m onstage with my band. But the more we grow in popularity, the more people compare me to him.</p> <p>I’m not him. And I never will be. If only everyone could figure that out for themselves.</p> <p>I need a break from it all.</p> <p>Then, a confrontation has me jumping in my car, putting LA in my rearview mirror. And a stupid mistake ends up with my car on the side of the road. And straight into the path of a girl who is the exact opposite of everyone else in my life.</p> <p>She’s like everything I used to know.</p> <p>And she has no clue who I am.</p> <p>Even if she did, I don’t think she’d care.</p> <p>She thinks I’m cavalier.</p> <p>I think she’s intriguing. And hot. Let’s not forget hot.</p> <p>I’m stuck in this town overnight while my car is being fixed. But I’m thinking I’m gonna stick around a bit longer.</p> <p>I’m Storm Slater, lead guitarist in Slater Raze and the only child of the late, great Jonny Creed. But, here, right now...I’m nobody. Just a regular guy.</p> <p>I’m liking it a whole lot.</p> <p>And I’m liking her even more.</p>";
