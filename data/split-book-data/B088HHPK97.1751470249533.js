window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>No take-backs.</b></p> <p>That was the motto that Drew lived by in all things, including his love life. He’s a player, pure and simple. He’s learned the hard way that women aren’t all hearts and flowers. Sometimes their sexy bodies and beautiful faces are just a pretty shield to hide the crazy, and he’s so freakin’ over crazy. Been there, done that. He has the divorce papers to prove it. </p> <p><b>Karma hits like a bitch. </b></p> <p>Aspen needs a break. A long one that doesn’t include anything with a Y chromosome. Not even one as tempting as her new neighbor who just moved in across the street. Men are trouble with a capital freakin’ T, and she has the ankle monitor to prove it. The last man she gave her heart to was a police officer. A man whose life was dedicated to protection; he was supposed to protect her heart - not break it. She decides right then and there that she’s done with being the better person.</p> <p><b>Everything happens for a reason.</b></p> <p>A rash decision - undoubtedly regrettable, undeniably unforgettable. In the heat of the moment, Aspen’s actions with a tire iron and her ex-boyfriend’s brand new SUV land him in the ER getting stitches and have her seeing the inside of a jail cell for the first time. It’s just her luck that the whole town is there to witness the result of her poor decision, including her police officer brother and the neighbor that already made it more than clear she was more trouble than she was worth. House arrest never looked so good.</p> <p><b>Hide your crazy.</b></p> <p>Drew enjoyed the show, though. For the first time in a year, he’s thinking about his life, and how it would be a lot more enjoyable with a woman like Aspen at his side. Maybe crazy isn’t so bad after all.</p>";
