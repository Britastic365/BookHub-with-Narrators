window.bookSummaryJSON = "Sexy and smoldering embers of my beautiful lady-friend still heat the bed. I am thrust into a dire emergency as I receive a call from an Immortal detective informing me that my ex-girlfriend is dead, murdered by some expression of power. What had started out as a prolific morning, will soon become a state-of-emergency. The immortal community is on the brink of exposure, and I have to solve my ex's murder and figure out what form of dark expression is killing humans and stealing life-essence from them, almost like a succubus but much more ruthless! Nothing will ever be ok again! The world tilts towards a chaos so profound that even the ageless ones are terrified of what lies just on the horizon! No pressure for a rookie like me! Not like I have to attempt to be focused, while I deal with a super-powerful Magus who is as sexy as she is deadly! Or that we are forced to work together, while I sort out the fallout of my mind around her! From the Author of Hannah Graves Series, and Femme Protectors Series. Set in the same Universe as Hannah Graves, Spencer Kacey brings her own brand of justice to the streets of New York and the Hidden Immortal city as well! Like Buffy, Lost Girl, and Firefly all had a love-child from an illicit three-way!";
