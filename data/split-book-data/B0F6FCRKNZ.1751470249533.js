window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A steamy secret identity billionaire romance from author C.S. Solarys.</p> <p>Lorcan Greene</p> <p>I’ve been watching her. Calculating, biding my time, planning what I’ll do to her when I finally have her. She is the exception to the rule. I don’t chase women; they fall at my feet. But for her, I’ll use everything at my command to make her mine.</p> <p>I want her body.</p> <p>I want her screams. I want her devotion.</p> <p>And I won’t stop until she doesn’t recognize herself without me.</p> <p>Tristen Morgana</p> <p>Whoever said men were made for anything more than pleasure hasn’t met me yet. I’ve perfected the game—meet at a neutral location, bang, disappear. And what I currently want is to sink my teeth into the hottie who spilled a drink on me last night and leave him none the wiser.</p> <p>There’s just one problem … he came prepared for the long-term game, and I’m haunted by dark secrets that cannot see the light of day.</p> <p>Lorcan’s Obsession is the first book in the Bedroom Roulette series, an interconnected trilogy. Expect morally gray characters, possessive/OTT MMC, amateur stalking, and enough heat to melt your listening device.</p>";
