window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Adam and I are both going through identity crises of epic proportions as we transition from who we were and discover who we were meant to be. More Fae are dying, and I feel as if time is running out for us to find all of those responsible and put an end to the killings.</p> <p>The people I thought I could trust have betrayed me, and the one person I should absolutely not trust is taking me deeper and deeper into his world.</p> <p>Ryder’s secrets are dangerous and devastating. </p> <p>With each touch and word, he pulls my heart closer to himself, and at the same time, he is trying to keep me at arm’s length. The dance he and I have begun is getting more complicated as our worlds are being shaken from all sides, and the visions of the future are frightening and nothing like I had ever pictured for myself or those I care for.</p> <p>This time, destiny is taunting me.</p> <p>I had always thought that I controlled my destiny. Now, my rights are being taken from me by powerful people and leaving me with alternatives that range between bad and awful. This time, the choices I have to make can decide the fate of both worlds.</p> <p>Everything is unraveling, and nothing will ever be the same again. </p> <p>Synthia</p>";
