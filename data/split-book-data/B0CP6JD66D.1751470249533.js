A beast by nightfall.</p> <p>There is a curse on his blood, an ailment that, if revealed, could destroy his kingdom. The only one who can help him is me, a human with average healing abilities. It's what the Envoy told him, and her word is law.</p> <p>I'm his only hope.</p> <p>He sends his blue-blooded friends to kidnap me so I can join their quest to Mount Ruin, the only place where I can heal him.</p> <p>The path is terrifying, and the prince is lying, hiding things from me.
