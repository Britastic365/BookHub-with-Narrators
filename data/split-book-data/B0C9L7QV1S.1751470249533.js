The public thinks the politicos run Washington. Who do you think is pulling their strings?</p> <p>I am.</p> <p>Some hate me for it…until they find themselves at the center of a scandal. That’s when I become their savior.</p> <p>When I step out of a limo, men stare in envy, while women gawk and blush. There’s always a pretty young thing draped on my arm, sometimes two. Window dressing to fill a void or keep me warm on a chilly night. <br> <br> They’re all gunning for the same thing—to be the One. But these women don’t hold my attention and they can’t snag my heart.</p> <p>Then, she crashes into my sinful world and I’m pulled by an invisible force even I can’t resist. She becomes my obsession, my reason to breathe.</p> <p>Everything changes the moment her gaze meets mine.</p> <p>Everything.</p>";
