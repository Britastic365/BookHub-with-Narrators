window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When my family finally left our little close-minded pack of assholes back in Utah to join a huge progressive pack in Northwest Louisiana, I thought I’d finally be free of the chains of judgment, scrutiny, and homophobia that had tainted my life with our old pack. I thought I was done with labels and pack drama, and I was ready to fly through my last two years of high school winning friends and influencing people with my stunning charisma—in spite of the fact that we were supposed to be lowly omega wolves.</p> <p>But when the Alpha’s son rejects my beloved sister as his fated mate on our very first day at Blackstone Academy, his callousness and stupidity kick off a chain of events that embroils us both in the drama we wanted to avoid, both at school and within the pack at large.</p> <p>It also entangles me with the Alpha Heir’s best friend and beta wolf, Thad James, and I can’t seem to fight my attraction to him—not that I try very hard. He’s a stuck-up, beautiful, cocky asshole behind those sexy-as-f--k glasses, and I make it my life’s goal to knock him off his game while he fights the intense chemistry between us.</p> <p>For him, there could never be anything serious between us because of who he thinks I am.</p> <p>And who am I? I’m Ben Fortune, and I’m going to get what I want.</p> <p><i>This is a new adult, academy-based paranormal </i><b><i>M/M romance</i></b><i>. While it can be read as a stand-alone, it is highly encouraged that you listen to Mave’s book (Blackstone Academy, Book 1) for a better listening experience. As always, this book is intended for the 18+ crowd and contains a lot of swearing and some spicy boy-on-boy action. If that all sounds like your jam, then dive in!</i></p>";
