window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Blaine</b> </p> <p>I hurt, break and kill for a living. The Family point, I deliver. But this time, they ask too much. This time, they want me to marry the one woman who knows my secret. She has reason to hate me, I know, but I'll take her, I'll break her, and I'll make her mine. That's the only way I can keep my secret. </p> <p><b>Mira</b> </p> <p>When I ran away eight years ago, I thought I'd escaped the underworld I'd always known. I made a life for myself. I thought I was free. Then my past came knocking at my door. Now I'm marrying the son of London's biggest crime family. A man who hates me as much as I hate him. He's ruthless, brutal, and dangerous - everything I've always feared. He's taken away the life I built, he's taken my freedom. And now, I fear he's taken my sanity, too. How else could I have ended up pregnant with his baby? </p>";
