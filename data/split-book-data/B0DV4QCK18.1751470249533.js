window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>He shattered my heart on our wedding day. Now we must set aside our heartbreak and join forces to save our world from the brink of chaos.</b></p> <p>Betrayed at the altar by the man I love, I don’t have the luxury to mourn my broken heart. The Blood Brotherhood Clan is under attack and dark secrets from my past begin to claw their way to light.</p> <p>Now I must fight beside the man who almost destroyed me.</p> <p>As the merciless prince leads his army on the battlefield, I wage my own war in the treacherous court, where smiles are sharper than blades and words can change the fate of a dynasty. If either of us falters, both of our Clans will be doomed.</p> <p>With my trust in pieces, despite his groveling and promises, I’m torn between vengeance and forgiveness. But the blood oath silencing his tongue cuts deeper than any betrayal and mercy is a weakness I can’t risk.</p> <p>The fierce bond between us doesn’t care about human heartache, though. It tightens its grip and brings us closer than we thought possible. We’re cursed to rise and fall together—if one of us dies, the other will follow, and the darkness hounding us will destroy everyone and everything I love.</p> <p><i>A Crown of Victory and Vengeance</i> is book two in the first duology of the A Curse of Silver Secrets and Cruel Shadows series and completes the story of Evie and Zandyr. It’s a slowburn, enemies-to-lovers romantasy where banter is a love language and secrets can kill. The series starts out hot and only gets hotter as the mystery grows.</p> <p>In the War of the Clans, which side will you choose? Protectorate VS. Blood Brotherhood.</p>";
