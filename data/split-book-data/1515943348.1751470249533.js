Yours truly, and worse - my beloved incubus Alec. Did I mention the new dean is also Harris' cousin? Harris will have to betray his family if he wants to help us, but the price he asks of me is...um...blush murmur.</p> <p>As if I don't have enough problems already, Firian is still stuck as a fox, Montague is getting a little more cozy with his vampire heritage, and Daisy is betrothed to the new dean who is more than willing to abuse her powers. I'm still trying to save my mom and bring her home to my dad, but the truth is, I'm scared. She's been working for a high demon for 20 years, and what will she do back in my little hometown? Go get a job at the diner and regale the local Baptists with stories of her days working for a demon? Yeah, right.</p> <p>The faeries might offer us a way out, but only if we can kill the high demon and deliver his head to the faery queen. We all have a stake in this fight, but are all the hours I spent playing MMORPGs sufficient training for a real life boss battle? I'm about to find out.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
