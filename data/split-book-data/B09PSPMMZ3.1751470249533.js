window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>After centuries spent in suspended animation, I'm </b><b><i>hangry</i></b><b>. Now, a team of sexy men have been sent to hunt me down...</b></p> <p><b>Let them come.</b></p> <p>Thanks to a protective spell gone wrong, I am what the world calls a siren. </p> <p>Yep, you heard me right. I'm a siren. The lost princess of Atlantis. During the horrific battle between light and darkness, as Atlantis sank beneath the waves, I was caught in some crazy magic that changed my body and put me down for a really long nap. The humans, still greedy as ever, woke me up when they stumbled on an energy source near the heart of my home. </p> <p>I battled alongside my Atlantean brothers and sisters as evil spread like a plague from city to city. We fought bravely, but in the end, I lost everything. I have nothing left to lose. </p> <p>That same darkness has continued to take over the world while I slept. My mission is to cleanse the world of evil, so I need to get busy. </p> <p>It is easy to find the men with blackened hearts and drag them to their watery graves beneath the sea, but it isn't long before the disappearances are noticed, and I go from hunter to hunted. Cleansing the world of evil takes a lot out of a siren. So, when the three good-hearted men cross my path, I'm ready to make them. I just need to figure out how things work with my new anatomy. </p> <p>This paranormal fantasy romance features a slightly darker siren who collects her mates throughout the series. This is not the usual bubbly mermaid tale! It is full of spice, humor, and a slightly feral siren...</p> <p>Oh! Let's not forget the totally ripped guys you will want to sink your fangs into! It will have a HEA...eventually.</p>";
