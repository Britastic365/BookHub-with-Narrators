window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When twenty-year-old college dropout Moriah Shaker runs into an empty chapel to escape an unexpected storm, she’s catapulted into another world <i>Wizard of Oz</i> style. Unfortunately, she winds up in the treacherous realm of Hakeldama, a fantastical but brutal land where justice is twisted and innocents pay for crimes committed by the elites—and she’s now marked for death.</p> <p>On the run and determined to get home, Moriah heads for the City of Lux, where a rumored portal between worlds exists. At her side are the most unlikely of companions. A scrappy hustler, a cranky ex-mayor, and a growing beast-dog. But the one who fascinates her most is Jasher, a heartless executioner who hides a terrible secret. Together, they’ll battle bounty hunters, lethal poppies, and winged monsters. Though Moriah doesn’t yet know it, there’s nothing more dangerous than their forbidden attraction.</p>";
