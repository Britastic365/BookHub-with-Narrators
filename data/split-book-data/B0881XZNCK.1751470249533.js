After years of cage fighting, Erik is ready to step away from the Nova Club’s fight ring and into a new role - security for the club he calls home. All his plans change when a lovely loner starts visiting the club, and he finds himself caught between the need to safeguard his home and his friends and his desire to protect the woman laying claim to his heart. </p> <p>Chance is a cyborg with a secret. If the wrong people find her, she’ll lose her shot at having the life she dreams of - or any life at all. She’s come to the Drift looking for allies, but when she meets Erik, she discovers he can offer her more than safety. He’s her chance at happiness, too. </p> <p>When time runs out, she’ll have to make a choice that will change her life forever - keep running or turn to the one man her heart tells her she can trust. </p>";
