A royal pain in my behind. And an all-around smug pest I wouldn’t mind knocking down a peg or two.<br> <br> It’s no surprise after so many years, our animosity has come to a head. I just never in my wildest, hate-fueled fantasies expected Noah’s attack to involve his lips on mine.<br> <br> It was a mistake, no question. But apparently I still have some things to figure out about myself.<br> <br> One thing I do know? Noah King and I have been bitter rivals from the start. And nothing, not even the fire he lights under my skin, makes a lick of difference in the end.<br> <br> Surrendering to my enemy isn’t an option.</p> <p><i>Brim Over Boot is a small town, enemies-to-lovers romance between rival farriers, with a double bi-awakening, tension and banter galore, scorching encounters, a slow fall from hate to love, and one very HEA. It’s book 2 in The Darling Brothers series but can be listened to as a standalone.</i></p>";
