window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>SIX-PACK SERIES BOOK TWO</p> <p>THEO: I'm next in line to be the alpha of my pack, but my father doesn't think I'm ready. In his eyes, I'll never be—he wants me to grow up, straighten up, to be someone I'm just... not. At least I've got the security squad in the meantime, and I'm taking on more responsibility by working with the squad's IT unit. I assumed working with a bunch of computer geeks would be boring as hell, but the new girl on the unit has me intrigued. I'm used to getting any girl I want, yet she's rebuffed all of my advances. She's a goody-goody, thinks she's too good for me—and hell, she probably is, but that won't stop me from trying to get in her pants. Underneath every good girl persona is a bad girl just dying to get out. Challenge accepted.</p> <p>BROOKE: All I wanted to do when I came to work for the IT unit at the security squad was keep my head down and do my job. I was doing it pretty well, too, until Theo got assigned as the liaison between the IT unit and squad leadership. I had a crush on him as a kid, but now that he's grown he's a foul-mouthed, womanizing hothead; a total alpha-hole. Other girls may fall for this good looks and his devil-may-care attitude, but I'm smarter than that. He's hanging around the IT unit to observe and report, but he's zeroed in on me for some reason; keeps trying to get under my skin. And just when I think I can escape him, fate delivers the cruelest twist yet.</p> <p>The Six-Pack Series is a collection of werewolf shifter romance novels. These books contain mature content (steamy scenes!) and themes that may not be suitable for younger listeners. If frequent use of profanity and f-words offend, then these books may not be for you. While this book ends with an HEA for the main characters and no major cliffhangers, there are some overarching storylines that may not be resolved at the conclusion of this book because they run throughout the series.</p>";
