window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"But heed this warning, and heed it well—your mate's life is linked with the very male she is destined to kill.\"</b></p> <p>With an iron collar wrapped around her throat, Sage is cut off from her powers and forced to live in Clearwell Castle, home to her enemy—the ruthless king whose bloodthirsty rule has led to the deaths of thousands of Cursed. Sage knows that if she is going to stop the persecution of the children of the Old Gods, she has to end the king's reign. Permanently.</p> <p>When she meets the devastatingly handsome heir to the Edenvale throne, Prince Aurelius, she finds another reason to stay at the castle. Who is this mysterious male that bears no resemblance to the king, and what is it about him that makes him feel so... familiar?</p> <p>As Sage begins to unlock the memories from her past, she discovers that Von hid more from her than just his identity—he hid what he took from her. Everything that she thought she knew about the seductive, dark, apple-loving immortal is brought into question, and there is only one way to find out the truth—she needs to remember it all.</p> <p>Like a deadly brushfire on a windy day, the past is coming. Will it forge Sage into someone stronger, or will it consume her?</p> <p>That is, if the lovers of her past don't devour her first.</p> <p><i>Between Sun and Moon</i> is the darker, steamier sequel to the best-selling <i>Between Life and Death</i>.</p>";
