window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The termagant being brought into the small clinic isn’t exactly what second in command and alpha soldier Kosh envisioned as his perfect omega, but he knows beyond a shadow of a doubt that she is his.</p> <p>She’s a fierce little thing, more of a threat than most would take her for, but he isn’t one of the unfortunate ones who will get caught underestimating her. They wouldn’t be given the chance to do so again.</p> <p>Tura doesn’t want to be here, even though she knows it’s a well-controlled and relatively safely run small city. And she most definitely doesn’t want to be paired off with some giant who thinks he has a claim on her, no matter what her lady parts want her to do.</p> <p>She almost succeeded in taking him out like she had the others, but instead, he will just wear the scar she’s given him for the rest of his life. A life he absolutely intends to spend taming her to the very hand she’s bitten.</p> <p><b>Publisher's note:</b> The second book in The Alpha's Woman series contains explicit scenes and power exchange. If either of these offend you, please do not purchase this audiobook.</p>";
