window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I'm done being the good girlâ€¦</p> <p>So much sacrifice. One betrayal too many.</p> <p>This bloodsucker has had enough.</p> <p>And with this strange dragon-shifter as my lover and partner, who is going to stop me?</p> <p>My old team has tried. They don't stand a chance.</p> <p>I don't want to be a queen, anymore. I want to be a goddess.</p> <p>Who's going to stop me? You?

Why can't I resist him?</p> <p>Do I even want to resist him?</p> <p>Bloody Brilliance is the fifth book in The Fury of a Vampire Witch. You've met Mercy before in The Legacy of a Vampire Witch and The Blood Witch Saga. She's fought against devils and demons, insidious witches, and old-world vampires. When she returns to Exeter, where she grew up as a girl, she'll find enemies even bigger and badder than anything she's ever faced before.</p> <p>A great series for fans of the True Blood / Sookie Stackhouse novels or the Underworld franchise to sink their fangs into. The Fury of a Vampire Witch features a dark and twisty romance, action that could even get a vampire's heart pumping, and a snarky badass heroine.</p>";
