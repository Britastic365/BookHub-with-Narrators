window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Three haunted young men. A terrible curse. One girl who could break it...if this place doesn't break her first.</p> <p>From the first time my parents decided that getting their next hit mattered more than keeping me fed, I learned I couldn't trust anyone - until Cade. My foster brother took me under his wing and sheltered me from the worst of the crap thrown at us.</p> <p>So when he heads off on an exclusive scholarship and everyone around me starts denying he ever existed, Roseborne College has some explaining to do. I'm not leaving until I get answers.</p> <p>The school I barge into isn't what I pictured. The staff claim Cade's never been here. The students glare like just looking at me offends them. The classes involve more torment than teaching, while sobs and howls fill the night. And three very different, unnervingly appealing guys - one of them a teacher - act way too invested in my arrival.</p> <p>Some unnatural power holds this place in its grip. The more I dig, the more horrors I uncover. Finding Cade might not be my biggest problem after all. It's looking like none of us, me included, will escape this place alive.</p> <p><i>Academy of the Forgotten</i> is the first book in a gothic paranormal trilogy with shades of<i> Beauty and the Beast</i>. If you love snarky heroines, damaged heroes, dark secrets galore, and reverse harem romance with no choosing required, look no further! Just beware: Once you enter Roseborne College, there may be no coming back...</p>";
