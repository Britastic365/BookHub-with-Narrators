Delight. <br> I was obsessed with her.<br> Truly, irrevocably obsessed.<br> She was stubborn. Standoffish. Painfully honest. <br> Take no prisoners efficient.<br> In summary, a termagant -- much too young for me.<br> And even I, oblivious bastard extraordinaire, was aware in some corner of my mind, of every well-laid plan I’d ever had slowly crashing down and exploding into dust. <br> I was simply no match for Devereux Laurent.<br> This book can be listened to as a stand-alone.</p>";
