window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>We were high school sweethearts. One day she disappeared after class and didn't come back. She left me high and dry. I was angry. I took it out on her by sleeping with her best friend. Then she showed back up with a story I didn't believe. I was done. </p> <p>I married her best friend after she got pregnant, and now I have a 17-year-old son who's stuck in the middle of our divorce. </p> <p>But then I saw my ex again. Feelings arose I thought I buried all those years ago. She's still mine. I proved it against a wall after a heated argument. I found out there's been no one else since me, and now that I have her again, I'll make sure there is no one else. </p> <p>Then I meet her son, and he looks just like me. </p> <p>He's also 17 and best friends with my son. </p>";
