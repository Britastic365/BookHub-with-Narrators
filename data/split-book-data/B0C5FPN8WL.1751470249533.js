As a young girl, I was all too aware of the power I wielded in a world where men were supposed to be the superior gender.</p> <p>To the underworld, I was just a mafia princess. To my family, I was an equal. To my soon-to-be husband? Well, that was yet to be determined. But I prayed Enzo Bianchi was ready for me because I was damn sure prepared for him.</p> <p><b>Enzo Bianchi</b></p> <p>The life I’d seen for myself was no longer an option. My entire world had been turned upside down by the very people who were supposed to be family—my<i> famiglia</i>.</p> <p>Us Bianchi men were starting anew—forging alliances with criminal organizations who understood our plight. The plan had been simple, cut and dry.</p> <p>That was until Lucia Moretti showed up with a plan of her own—one I couldn’t say no to. Now everything was at stake, including my heart.</p> <p><i>Sinful Vow </i>is book one in the Mafia Misfits series and can be listened to as a standalone.
