Whatever choice Jamie makes will have lasting repercussions he can’t escape and that Staff Sergeant Kyle Brannigan will suffer as well. </p> <p>Against an escalating political nightmare, the one truth Jamie can believe in is Kyle’s love, but that won’t be enough to clear their names. The odds are stacked ever higher against Alpha Team, and outmaneuvering an enemy metahuman is a daunting, almost impossible task. When the other side strikes, all hell breaks loose in the country’s capital, and no one is prepared for the tragedy the attack leaves in its wake.</p>";
