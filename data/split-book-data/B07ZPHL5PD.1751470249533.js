But Nevan is hiding a dark secret.<br> <br> As Lindsey is drawn deeper into a parallel world where magic reigns and bargains have deadly consequences, she realizes she might be the key to saving two worlds.

A ragtag band of elementals might become her strongest allies.<br> <br> Because yeah, the apocalypse is coming.<br> <br> The Janusite Trilogy includes three full-length novels from the Undercover Elementals series of steamy paranormal romances, plus bonus chapters found only in this collection.</p>";
