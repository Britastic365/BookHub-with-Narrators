window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Hannah Lewis, a rare earth witch, is taken from the only life she's ever known. Held at her will by a sadistic wolf, she almost gives up hope that she'd ever see her real life again. But as her fellow captive, a werewolf named Reed, tries to calm her fears, she begins to feel a spark of something she never thought she'd feel - love. But is Reed, alone, enough to get her out of this dark basement so she can move on with her life? </p> <p>Reed Jamenson, the artist of a werewolf Pack of Alpha males, knows instinctually that Hannah is his mate. Thus, despite their imprisonment, he will do all to protect her and then worry about their hearts. But is he strong enough to find a way for both of them to escape? And why does he feel as though something else is missing? </p> <p>Josh Kolb, an ex-military human, stumbles upon Reed and Hannah and finds he must trust this new world of supernatural beings to survive. But that desire will lead the three to a triangle of attraction that will test the boundaries they all possess and its consequences in defeating the enemy. Can they all trust one another to save themselves and life as they know it? Even at the cost of their own hearts? </p> <p>This audiobook is an m/m/f. It contains m/m/f, m/f/m, m/f, and m/m scenes. </p>";
