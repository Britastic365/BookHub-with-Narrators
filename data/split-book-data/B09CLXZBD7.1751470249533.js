window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I conquered her planet and pillaged her body. Now I’m back for her heart.</p> <p>A decade ago, I brought war to Solgad, home of the Jal’zar. I sacked the planet and slaughtered the people, all to save my race from extinction. Until one of their female warriors hissed defiance, promising me death at her hands no matter how her body longed for mine.</p> <p>Each night, she came to end me, only to succumb to the raw urges of her mating heat. Each night, I gave her hungry womb what it needed, the way we coupled neither safe nor sane.</p> <p>I was the enemy she couldn’t kill. She was the female I couldn’t have.</p> <p>Together, we unleashed chaos.</p> <p>Many solar cycles after the occupation, I return to Solgad, searching the ashen plains for her: my soul mate. This time, I will claim the Jal’zar female as mine, and nobody will get in the way.</p> <p>Not even myself.</p> <p><i>Chained</i> is the fifth book in this interconnected romance series, taking us to Solgad, home of the Jal'zar.
