window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Some days feel like years, but in Ember Brycin's case just the opposite is true. Em would be 22 now - if she were human. She's not. She is a Dae - part Demon and part Fay - with a little Dark Dweller thrown in to make her more of a freak. </p> <p>Life has become more complicated for Ember since returning from the Otherworld. Besides being continuously hunted by the Seelie Queen, Ember is at the top of the Unseelie King's list, after breaking her oath with him. No one breaks a vow with the Unseelie King without extreme consequences. </p> <p>Adding to Ember's problems is a certain Dark Dweller whose mood has become violent and cruel. As much as she'd like to deny it, there is an undeniable connection between them. Eli is sexy, gorgeous, and frustrating as hell. She also knows he is holding something back, something that could change their relationship forever. </p> <p>But her problems go way past him. As the tension for war mounts between the Seelie and Unseelie (Light and Dark), the tension at the Dark Dweller's compound escalates even more as they prepare to obtain the Sword of Light - the only weapon able to kill the Queen. </p> <p>But is Ember the answer to the location of the sword? Is she the one to fulfill the prophecy? As usual, nothing is ever what it seems. </p>";
