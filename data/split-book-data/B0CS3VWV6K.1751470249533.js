window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>When it comes to love, hex marks the spot in this enchanting romance that will delight fans of </b><b><i>Practical Magic</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>The Very Secret Society of Irregular Witches</i></b><b>. . .</b></p> <p>As a child, Delia Merriweather believed with all her heart that she was a witch. Because <i>all</i> Merriweather women were witches. There was just one problem: they had no magic. As an adult, Delia no longer believes magic even exists. However, when she accidentally breaks a hex and restores her family’s powers, she’s forced to accept a new reality: she <i>is </i>a witch. And maybe that’s why the crushingly handsome guy next door has been looking at her like he’s expecting her to fly off on a broomstick, cackling into the night.</p> <p>Just when Max thinks he’s done keeping an eye on the bumbling Merriweather women, now he must help his neighbors learn to control their magic before they out witches everywhere. But Delia can’t decide if Max is helping or hexing, and Max can’t tell whether his growing feelings for Delia are real, or if he’s come under the spell of the most powerful—and clueless—witch he’s ever known. And the last thing Max needs is to fall for the one witch who could rule the entire witching world by controlling the hearts of men.</p>";
