window.bookSummaryJSON = "Long ago, Ephemera was split into a dizzying number of magical lands - connected only by bridges that may take you where you truly belong, rather than where you had intended to go. <p>In one such land, where night reigns and demons dwell, the half-incubus Sebastian revels in dark delights. But in dreams she calls to him: a woman who wants only to be safe and loved - a woman he hungers for while knowing he may destroy her. And an even more devastating destiny awaits him, for an ancient evil is stirring - and Sebastian's realm may be the first to fall.</p>";
