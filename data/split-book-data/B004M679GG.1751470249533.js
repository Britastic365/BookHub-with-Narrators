But when her career plans are derailed, her boyfriend, security expert Sean Rogan, asks for help on his latest private investigation. Using her well-honed cyber-hunting skills, Lucy is soon on the trail of a missing teenage girl with a penchant for disappearing—and a shocking secret life. </p> <p>FBI Agent Suzanne Madeaux is also tracking someone: a serial killer on the loose in New York City.
