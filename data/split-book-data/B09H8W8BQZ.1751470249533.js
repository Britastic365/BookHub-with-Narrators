window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A red hot bully duet...</b></p> <p><b><i>Broken by the Bully</i></b><b>:</b></p> <p><b>Asher Hansen began tormenting me our freshman year, not long after my father kicked him and his older brother off the compound with nothing but the clothes on their back.</b></p> <p>They blamed Dad for their mother taking her own life. To be honest, I think I did, too.</p> <p>Maybe that’s why I took it whenever Asher called me Cult Barbie and teased me mercilessly, saying the filthiest, most outrageous things. But that doesn't explain why his words always made me feel...fizzy inside.</p> <p>To say I’ve been waiting for this moment is an understatement. It’s graduation day, a big deal for every 18-year-old and an even bigger deal for someone who grew up the way I did.</p> <p>But for me today is about more than the end of high school. It's about taking control of my life. Today, I’m actually going to do it. The one thing <i>I </i>can do to shock <i>him</i>. My ruthless nemesis.</p> <p>I guarantee he won’t see it coming.<br> <br> <i>Bargain with the Bully</i></p> <p>For four years, Jackson Hansen has done his best to make my life a living hell. Even when I finally agree that his brother is good for my best friend, Emma, he won’t give me a break.</p> <p>He mocks me, mortifies me, and worst of all...makes out with me in the backs of taxis when we’ve both had a few too many beers. He’s the last person I want as my plus one for a destination wedding.</p> <p>If only I hadn’t made that stupid bet or promised to be his sweet, obedient wedding date if Emma and Asher did end up getting hitched.</p> <p>If only I didn’t enjoy kissing him so much. If only this wounded, jaded man wasn’t the only person I can imagine punching my V-card.</p> <p>If Jackson finds out I’m still a virgin, he’ll never let me live it down. Unless...</p> <p><b>Maybe I can make another bargain with my bully, a sexy bargain he won’t see coming until we’re on a tropical island, sharing a room with one bed.</b></p>";
