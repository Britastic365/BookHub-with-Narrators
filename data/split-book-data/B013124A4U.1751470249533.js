window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Someone, somewhere, has declared war on Kevin Kichida, and that someone has a long list of magical predators in their Rolodex. The good news is that Kevin lives in a town where Ted Cahill is the new sheriff and old ally of John Charming. The attacks on Kevin seem to be a pattern, and the more John and his new team follow that thread, the deeper they find themselves in a maze of supernatural threats, family secrets, and age-old betrayals. The more John learns, the more convinced he becomes that Kevin Kichida isn't just a victim - he's a sacrifice waiting to happen. And that thread John's following? It's really a fuse.... </p>";
