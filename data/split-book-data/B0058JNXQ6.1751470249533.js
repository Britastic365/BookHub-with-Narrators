Anna will have to live up to her name to make it through alive.</p> <p> In \"Magic Dreams\" from Ilona Andrews, old legends and frightening nightmares come to life. The shapeshifting Tigress Dali Harimau finds herself in deep water when she must challenge a dark being to a battle of wits, or risk losing the man she secretly longs for. </p> <p>Finally, in Yasmine Galenorn's \"Ice Shards,\" Iris Kuusi, a Finnish house sprite who lives with the D'Artigo sisters, must journey to the frozen Northlands to confront the crazed shadow of the former lover she's accused of murdering, so she can break the curse keeping her from marrying the man she loves.
