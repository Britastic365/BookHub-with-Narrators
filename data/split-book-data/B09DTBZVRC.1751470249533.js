window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Five hockey players, a cabin in the woods...and little old me, Winnie Berlin.</p> <p>Sounds like the start of a fantasy, right? But it's not. It's my reality.</p> <p>It all started when I got lost in the middle of the Canadian Rockies. A wicked thunderstorm sent my car mud sliding into a ditch, and for a girl whose survival skills involve finding the nearest Starbucks, I was in deep trouble.</p> <p>Forced to abandon my car in search of help, I stumbled upon a cabin in the middle of nowhere. Soaking wet, irritated, and in desperate need of a hot shower, I knocked on the door for help only to be greeted by five boisterous, burly, and insanely attractive men.</p> <p>Not just men.</p> <p>Professional hockey players.</p> <p>I hit the motherload of fantasies, right? Wrong.</p> <p>Because as it turns out, one of them is my ex-boyfriend's half-brother. And when I end up crashing in their spare bedroom for the night, things take a very unexpected turn.</p> <p>I'm not sure any amount of survival skills can protect my heart from Vancouver Agitators star goalie, Pacey Lawes. But as long as we kiss and donâ€™t tell, maybe everything will be okay....</p>";
