The place where I lost everything, and yet the only one I ever called home.</b></p> <p>Then they came to me for help, three desperate men on a journey to rescue their brother. I was the only one who could get them through the portal, and as much as I wanted to turn them away, I couldn't.</p> <p>Something about these men called to me. I could sense a whisper of Nymeria inside of them, but that didn't make sense. They were only human.</p> <p>For now, at least. To find their brother, they'd need to change. No human had ever survived stepping foot in Nymeria.</p> <p>In a world filled with magic and treachery, it's more than just the monsters we have to worry about. Everything has changed since I was last here. The people are afraid, and they should be. A madman is on a mission to seize the land, and they have no one left to fight for them.</p> <p>Because I ran.</p> <p>But now I'm coming back.</p>";
