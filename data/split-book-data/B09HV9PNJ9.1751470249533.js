window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Gifted thief Romeria has flourished from her days as a street kid pilfering wallets to survive. Now she thrives, stealing jewels from the rich under the involuntary employ of New York City's most notorious crime boss. But when an enigmatic woman secures her services at swordpoint, Romeria is plunged into a startling realm of opposing thrones, warring elven, and elemental magic she cannot begin to fathom.</p> <p>Her quest is straightforward: Steal a stone from Islor's sacred garden without anyone discovering her true identity, which would earn her certain death. But the identity she has inexplicably assumed is that of the captured Ybarisan princess - an enemy to Islor after she poisoned their beloved king and queen on the day she was to marry the prince.</p> <p>Her betrothed, the newly crowned King Zander, detests her with every grain of his handsome being. Zander gives her a choice: life in a cell or an acquittal of all charges in exchange for her help in exposing the growing plot against him.</p> <p>Romeria sees no other option and embraces the tricky role of smitten queen-to-be until she can escape. As she digs deeper, she discovers monstrous truths that could spell ruin for all.</p>";
