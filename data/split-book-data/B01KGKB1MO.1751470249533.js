window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In <i>Body of Evidence</i>, a sexy, romantic, political thriller, an archaeologist and a US Attorney find themselves on an explosive, globe-spanning chase full of political intrigue and legal drama. <i>Body of Evidence</i> is the second book in Grant's Evidence Series, where archaeology, politics, and war collide. And she thought facing a firing squad was bad...When archaeologist Mara Garrett traveled to North Korea to retrieve the remains of GIs lost in combat, she never imagined she'd be arrested, convicted of spying, and sentenced to death. Her only hope is Curt Dominick, the powerful, ambitious, and infuriatingly sexy US attorney prosecuting her uncle, a former vice president of the United States. </p> <p>What starts off as a rescue mission quickly morphs into a race across the Pacific. Someone is after Mara, and they'll risk everything to stop her from reaching Washington, D.C. With betrayal around every corner, Curt and Mara have little reason to trust each other, and every reason to deny the sparks between them that blaze hotter than the Hawaiian sun. Still, desire clashes with loyalty when they discover a conspiracy that threatens not only their lives, but the national security of the United States. </p>";
