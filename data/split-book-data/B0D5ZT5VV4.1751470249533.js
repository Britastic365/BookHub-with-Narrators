window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>With the King of Winter's vile threats hanging over me, I have two choices: Marry Prince Valeâ€”or run and, most likely, die.</b></p> <p>Then again, perhaps I'll die anyway when the King of Winter learns I killed a vampire prince...</p> <p>I might even want to die if I started a war between the fae and the vampires, but I can't just turn away from the trouble I've created. Nor take away the honorable prince's dream to find his fated mate. So I accept Vale's protection under one condition: We form a marriage of convenience.</p> <p>Once the turmoil I've created calms, the prince assures me that we'll find a way for me to flee without recourse. I'll finally get to be free.</p> <p>But there are a few things that I didn't count on... Like how Vale grows on me, and how the desire between us blossoms. Or how the rising rebellion makes things more difficult.</p> <p>Most of all, I didn't count on discovering so many buried secrets. One in particular that strikes me straight in the heart: that the frigid halls of Frostveil Castle are where I've been meant to be all along.</p> <p>A Lord of Snow and Greed <i>is a dual POV fae fantasy romance filled with court intrigue, secrets, steamy romance, and adventure. If you like the twists and turns of Throne of Glass and the court drama of Game of Thrones, you'll love this installment in The Winter Court Series.</i></p>";
