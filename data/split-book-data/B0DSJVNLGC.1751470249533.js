window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>An injured rugby star, his pregnant roommate, and one rule they can’t break: Don’t date the owner’s daughter.</i></b><br> <br> It was supposed to be an easy house- and dog-sitting gig while the owner was gone for a month. But when my sportsing landlord comes home unexpectedly, injured and in need of a new arrangement, we end up as accidental roommates instead.<br> <br> But if Holt Webster, the tall, thick-muscled, square-jawed, broody-eyed rugby player, had told me he played for the Copper Valley Pounders, I would’ve told him that my stepdad bought the team while I was working cruise ships overseas.<br> <br> And he would’ve noped out of offering me a place to stay because the only thing worse than looking like you’re flirting with the owner’s daughter is looking like you’re hooking up with the owner’s pregnant daughter.<br> <br> Yes, yes, I’m <i>that</i> woman—the one who accidentally got knocked up, decided to keep the baby, and had to move home because pregnancy and cruise ships aren’t a good match.<br> <br> And now I’m <i>that</i> woman who doesn’t just look like she’s hooking up with an off-limits player. I actually <i>am</i> hooking up with an off-limits player. But who can blame me? He’s hot. He’s kind. And he’s spending our nights sleeping with his hand on my baby bump.<br> <br> Claiming us both.<br> <br> But if my dad finds out, Holt’s gone. And we’ll be…rucked.<br> <br> <i>The Roommate Mistake is a heart-tugging sports romcom featuring two people in need of new best friends, a dog with an attitude, and a very…fowl…meet-cute. It stands alone and comes complete with a found family happily ever after.</i><br> <i>Content note: This book contains a character dealing with the loss of his brother to cancer.</i></p>";
