window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Nothing is what it seems....</i></p> <p>Basra is the eternal city - a paradise filled with relics of the old world. We are welcomed into the upper sanctum of Basranian society where sly smiles and wicked eyes tempt us with riches and lavish comfort, yet something seems hopelessly wrong. The city is decaying. A rotten core with a deadly key that unlocks something even more sinister in one of the guy's pasts. </p> <p><i>And paradise is filled with lies and deceit....</i></p> <p>As an ambassador for Tartarus, it's my duty to bridge the gap between us and the other cities. But even more, as part of this team, it's my right to know the truth. We need these alliances now more than ever. Duty or not, though, I will seek out the truth of Basra. I will find the rotten core and cut it out. And then I'll unlock the door to his past and hopefully find the key to our salvation. </p> <p><i>Contains mature themes.</i></p>";
