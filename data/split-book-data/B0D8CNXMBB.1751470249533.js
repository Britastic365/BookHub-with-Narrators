window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This box set contains the complete Queen of the Damned series and the short story \"A Day in the Life of Bandit.\"</p> <p>We've all heard the story of the Four Horsemen. Harbingers of the apocalypse. Destruction given form. Four of the sexiest-wait no-forget that. You get my point.</p> <p>So imagine my surprise when I find out everything I've ever been told, is a lie.</p> <p>But we're getting ahead of ourselves here. Let's start from the beginning. My name is Ruby Morningstar. I run a tattoo parlor in Portland with my best friend, have a pet raccoon, a crazy ex that stalks me, not to mention this one little thing . . . I'm a demon. Half-succubus, to be exact. For the last twenty-three years of my life, that's the story I believed, but on the day a handsome stranger bails me out of jail my world is turned upside down, and suddenly I don't know who I am anymore.</p> <p>Because the Four Horsemen aren't the bringers of the apocalypse. I am.</p> <p>Talk about never catching a break.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
