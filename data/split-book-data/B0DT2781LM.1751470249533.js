window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>One Shotgun Wedding + One Wrong Bride = One Big Mess</b></p> <p>Duncan Archer doesn't do relationships. He prefers buying a date over buying dinner for a date.</p> <p>One night in Paris, he is set up to believe that the daughter of a French mob boss is his paid date. When she ends up pregnant, there's no way out but marriage. First, Elsa is carrying his child. Second (or maybe first?), her father has a gun to his head.</p> <p>Now, the eternal bachelor is expecting a baby, dealing with a violently criminal father-in-law, and coping with parents thrilled about becoming grandparents.</p> <p>And his new bride? She's sweet, strong, and surprisingly captivating. He can't get enough of her both in and out of bed. She says she's in love with him. He's behaving like he's in love with her, and he doesn't even know what that four-lettered word means. She's scaring the life out of him.</p> <p>Old habits die hard, and in his attempt to protect his heart, Duncan doesn't trust Elsa and does the one thing she begged him not to do.</p> <p>Too late, Duncan realizes that the wrong bride is actually the right wife. If he can't win Elsa's trust back, he could lose the two most important people in his life, his wife and their child.</p> <p>The Wrong Bride <i>is a billionaire, surprise pregnancy, marriage of convenience romance. It's a complete standalone and features a shotgun wedding, forced proximity, mafia-adjacent, a ten-year age gap, Paris, and no cheating.</i></p>";
