window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The best-selling suspense author shows her softer side in this endearing love story of two searching hearts....</b></p> <p>Georgia Enright has dedicated her life to dance. But at age 26, her hopes of becoming a lead dancer are dashed. So she ventures to Pumpkin Hill, an old farm owned by her newly found half sister, Laura Bishop, to contemplate her future. There, discovering an affinity for country life - and a barn just perfect for giving dance lessons - Georgia enjoys an oasis of peace…until Matthew Bishop arrives. </p> <p>An abandoned child taken in by the same parents who adopted Laura, Matt has plans of his own for that barn - plans that include a veterinary clinic, not a ballet studio! The only thing the rugged doctor resents more than Laura's interest in her birth family is his having to share the premises with one of them. Yet he can't deny there's something about Georgia that has brightened his world - and if he's not careful, she just may dance into his heart.</p>";
