His friends and family, however, have not. In fact, they believe they've finally found his perfect match. Getting them together, however, requires one little white lie.... </p> <p>Alexandra Willan is in a panic. Her restaurant is due to open in two weeks, but her chef just walked out. Then a highly recommended replacement arrives, an impossibly handsome culinary genius who sends electric tingles racing through her body.... </p> <p>Except he can't cook. In fact, Cale hasn't eaten real food in 2,000 years. Yet he's determined to prove to Alex his prowess in the kitchen - and elsewhere. Because never has he hungered so for any mortal woman.
