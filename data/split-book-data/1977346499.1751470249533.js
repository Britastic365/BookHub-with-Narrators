window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Sex Material.... </p> <p>It's what I'm known around town for. A rock-hard body, covered in tattoos with a sizeable bulge that women spend their nights fantasizing about. Women track me down, needing someone that will take them rough without holding back. They find me because they need a distraction from reality. They need something to get their mind off of the boyfriend who screwed them over or the job promotion they got passed over on at work. Sometimes, it's just because they need someone reckless in the bedroom before settling down with the right one. </p> <p>I'm not the suit wearing, flower-buying guy you take home to meet the parents. I'm not the guy who will make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. </p> <p>I was boyfriend material once. Would've even made a good husband. Until one night changed everything. </p> <p>Then Cami shows up in my hometown, broken-hearted and pissed off at the world, needing an escape from her cheating ex. She's interested in one thing only from me - to move into my rental property. But the problem with that is the more we fight, the deeper she buries herself in my soul. </p> <p>Sex material is what I'm good at, but for the first time, it may not be enough. </p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
