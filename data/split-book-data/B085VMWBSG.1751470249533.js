window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>“How does one start a relationship with another man when it is forbidden?”</p> <p>“One needs to decide that the other man is worth dying for.\"</p> <p><b>Cornwall, 1785</b></p> <p>Sir Evan Penhart. Baronet. Highwayman. Scoundrel. </p> <p>Julian Reece. Writer. Wastrel. Penniless.</p> <p>No one forces Julian Reece to marry. Not his father, not his brother. No one. </p> <p>When he is thrust into a carriage heading for London to meet his future bride, his way out comes in the form of an imposing highwayman, riding a horse as black as night. Julian makes a deal with the criminal, but what he doesn’t expect is that despite the title of baronet, the robber turns out to be no gentleman.</p> <p>Sir Evan Penhart is pushed into crime out of desperation, but the pact with a pretty, young merchant’s son turns out to have disastrous consequences. Not only is Evan left broke, but worse yet, Julian opens up a Pandora’s box of passions that are dark, needy, and too wild to tame. With no way to lock them back in, rash decisions and greedy desire lead to a tide that wrecks everything in its way.</p> <p>But Julian might actually like all the sinful, carnal passion unleashed on him. How can he admit this though, even to himself, when a taste of the forbidden fruit could have him end up with a noose around his neck? And with highway robbery being a hanging offense and the local constable on their back, Julian could lose Evan before he can decide anything about the nature of his desires.</p> <p><b>Themes:</b> highwayman, abduction, ransom, forbidden love, self-discovery, danger, crime, Cornwal, Britain, England, Georgian</p> <p><b>WARNING:</b> Steamy content.
