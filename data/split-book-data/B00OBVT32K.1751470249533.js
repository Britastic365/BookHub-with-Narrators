window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The crew is back and they're dirtier than ever. </p> <p>Five sexy men with a penchant for love and lust in any variation have formed a crew. They work hard and play harder - together. Though their partnership began in construction, renovating houses and selling them for a mint, they've formed a bond around their shared goal to provide women, and each other, with the ultimate sexual experience. </p> <p>Over the past year, as each member discovered his soul mate - or two - they expanded the reach of their circle, lighting up their nights along with their souls. Monogamous relationships and the desire to start families threaten to put their libertine revelry on the back burner. Will the passion that bonded them fade away? How will the new crew wives cope with the complex relationship the men will always cherish and crave? </p> <p>Determined to prove they stand by their men, the women decide it's time to flex some muscle and give the crew a dose of girl power. They collude to take the guys as their horny hostages, using some big guns: boudoir photos, a pillow fight and a calculated foray into partner swapping. But will they have the guts to go through with their plans? </p> <p>Warning: By Book Five in this series, fans will attest that anything goes in the crew. Be prepared for menage in every flavor - along with a slew of \"that's what he said\" jokes. No throwing tomatoes at the author, please!</p>";
