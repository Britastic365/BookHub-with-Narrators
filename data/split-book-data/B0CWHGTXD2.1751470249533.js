window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A holiday fling—or a deadly mistake?</b></p> <p>After enduring an exhausting year, two weeks in the south of France is exactly what Hope Devlin needs. Sun, sea, sand, and relaxation. Romance is not in the cards—until a handsome stranger muscles his way into her life. He's cocky, blunt, unapologetic, and oh-so-sexy. There's just one problem: Hope's future is already mapped out, and her new lover isn't part of the plan.</p> <p>Former SAS Sergeant Zander Knight is looking for a little fun to detract from his family's unreasonable demands. He did not expect to meet someone who blindsided him, stirring up feelings and leaving him hungry for more. But the woman of his dreams fails to show at their pre-arranged meeting point in London, leaving Zander little option other than to forget she ever existed.</p> <p>Six months later, a chance meeting with Hope gives Zander an opportunity to uncover the truth. He gets his wish and a whole lot more when he finds himself drawn into a dark underworld of dirty dealings and traded favors.</p> <p>Is Hope worth the risk, or should he listen to her stark warnings and walk away for good?</p>";
