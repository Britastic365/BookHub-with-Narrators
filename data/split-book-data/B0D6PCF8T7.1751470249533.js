window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When the blood moon rises...so do the souls of the dead.</p> <p>A few hauntings. No big deal, right?</p> <p>What's the worst that can happen?</p> <p>They might scare the crap out of you. You might need to change your bedsheets...</p> <p>But ghosts can't really hurt people...</p> <p>Or, can they?</p> <p>Vampires don't have souls. They remain in possession of Baron Samedi... The ghosts have decided to fill the vacancy.</p> <p>If we were being possessed by demons I'd know how to handle it.</p> <p>But when vampires are being possessed by the warped souls of dead humans... who suddenly feel the power and craving of a vampire's nature... Not even the oldest of us can resist.</p> <p>My magic is protecting me... for now... But I might be the only real vampire left. How do you exorcise a human spirit from a vampire's body?</p> <p>Is it even possible?</p> <p>If not, how do I go about trying to control or tame the bloodlust of a human soul in the driver's seat of some of the most ancient vampires around the world?</p> <p>Bloody Moon is the eighth book in The Fury of a Vampire Witch. You've met Mercy before in The Legacy of a Vampire Witch and The Blood Witch Saga. She's fought against devils and demons, insidious witches, and old-world vampires. When she returns to Exeter, where she grew up as a girl, she'll find enemies even bigger and badder than anything she's ever faced before.</p> <p>A great series for fans of the True Blood/Sookie Stackhouse novels or the Underworld franchise to sink their fangs into. The Fury of a Vampire Witch features a dark and twisty romance, action that could even get a vampire's heart pumping, and a snarky badass heroine.</p>";
