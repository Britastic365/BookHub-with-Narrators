If you enjoy it, you'll love the full-length love stories of all the other characters too!</p><p>Beau Martinez is perfectly content with his life. Well, almost. His ex-wife still feels the need to pop up and push his buttons periodically, but that's better than still being married to her. He has a successful business, great friends, and his supermutt, Freddie, by his side if he gets lonely. He doesn’t want, or need, the drama of another woman in his life. If only his friend Dani would believe him and quit trying to set him up!</p><p>Kim McMahon just had her heart broken—again. She caught her cheating boyfriend in the act at the very hospital where they both work. And he had the nerve to blame her! To overcome her sorrow, her good friend Dani invites her over for a girls’ night of cocktails and carbs. Exactly what the doctor ordered. Kim’s done with putting her heart out there, only to have it stomped on again.</p><p>When their mutual friend introduces them, the instant attraction sparks and sizzles. Dragged to the Gladewater Valentine party by Dani, they're randomly paired up for the Valentine Games, the pull between them is overwhelming. But will a one-night stand blow up into a love that neither expected or can deny?</p><p></p>";
