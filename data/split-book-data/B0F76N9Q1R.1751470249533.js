The alpha orders me to make her forget, but one hint of her scent and I know the truth—this human is MINE.</p> <p>Riley’s half my age. She has her whole life in front of her. If I claim her, I lock her into a fate she never even imagined. Besides, she thinks I’m a player–only out for one thing.</p> <p>I should stay away. Should let her go. But Riley is too sweet, too beautiful, and far too <i>mine</i>.</p> <p>Now she’s caught between our two worlds—one side thinks we should steer clear of each other. The other wants a forever bond…either way, she’ll suffer the consequences.</p> <p>She doesn’t understand the bond between us, but I can’t protect her without it. When danger comes for her, she has to trust me to keep her safe—the wolf who was born to be hers.</p>";
