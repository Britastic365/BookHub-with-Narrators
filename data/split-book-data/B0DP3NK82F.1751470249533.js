window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>My hot one-night-stand just became my professor…I don't do relationships, but when a gorgeous bartender presses her chest in my face on New Year's Eve, I take it as a sign that maybe I should bend my rules. </p> <p>I’ve been under so much pressure lately, between my agent and my soccer prospects and my abusive biological father trying to extort money I don’t even have. What better way to distract myself from the pressures of going pro than to get under a woman whose curves could make a venus statue jealous? Fern is everything a man could ask for: unbearably sexy, brilliantly smart, and oh-so-responsive in bed. That unforgettable night is the best bad decision I've ever made. That is until she shows up as the TA in my math class. Suddenly, our forbidden connection could jeopardize both of our futures. </p> <p>When a vengeful reporter exposes my secret relationship with Fern and threatens her academic career, I'll do anything to protect her - even if it means giving up everything I've worked for. To have a shot at happily ever after with the woman I love, I have to confront my painful past head-on and fight like hell to forge my own path. Can I break free from the shadows that haunt me and build a new life with Fern by my side? One thing's for sure - I've never wanted anything more.</p>";
