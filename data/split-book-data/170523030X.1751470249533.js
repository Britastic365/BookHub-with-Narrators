window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A painfully awkward love story.</p> <p>Incomprehensibly awkward Elizabeth Wilde is desperate for love. Connection. Intimacy. After a lifetime of romantic failures, the 21-year-old gamer realizes she needs help. Professional help. She needs...a sex tutor.</p> <p>The devastatingly hot jock Austin Jacobs is just the man for the job. As the reigning campus sex god, he has the playboy act down pat. But underneath those six-pack abs beats a broken heart. He doesn't trust people, and he sure as hell doesn't believe in love.</p> <p>The odd couple strikes a deal. Four weeks of \"tutoring\" for $5,000.</p> <p>When Austin coaxes Elizabeth out from behind her computer screen, the attraction they feel is undeniable. They're both a little broken, but somehow their jagged edges fit. And when their world comes tumbling down on top of them, they each have to decide if this weird thing called love is worth fighting for.</p>";
