window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>He’s a fierce, ferocious, death-dealing beast. And he’s reading a book in her library...</b></p> <p>In a world of recently warring orcs and men, Rosa Rolfe leads a quiet, scholarly life as an impoverished librarian—until the day she finds an <i>orc</i>. In her library. Reading a <i>book</i>.</p> <p>He’s rude, aggressive, and deeply terrifying, with his huge muscled form, sharp black claws, and cold, dismissive commands. But he doesn’t <i>seem</i> truly dangerous…at least, until night falls, when he makes Rosa a shocking, scandalous offer.</p> <p>Her books, for her surrender. Her ecstasy. Her enlightenment…</p> <p>Rosa’s no fool, and she knows she can’t possibly risk her precious library for this brazen, belligerent orc. Even if he <i>is</i> surprisingly well-read. Even if he smells like sweet, heated honey. Even if he makes Rosa’s heart race with fear, and ignites all her deepest, darkest cravings at once…</p> <p>But surrender demands a dangerous, devastating price. A bond that can’t easily be broken. And a breakneck journey to the fearsome, forbidding Orc Mountain, where a curious, clever librarian might be just what’s needed to stop another war…</p> <p><b>A dark, angsty, full-length fantasy romance. Comes after </b><b><i>The Heiress and the Orc</i></b><b>, but also acts as a standalone. Happily ever after guaranteed.</b></p>";
