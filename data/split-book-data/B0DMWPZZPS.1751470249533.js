window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>It was always you, babe.</i></b><br> <br> <b>A Slow Burn, Surprise Pregnancy, Second Chance, Rock Star, Standalone Romance from S.L. Scott, a </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>USA Today </i></b><b>bestselling author.</b><br> <br> The hottest rock star in the world walking into my work wasn’t on my bingo card. <i>Speak of the devil . . .</i><br> <br> <i>My soon-to-be ex-husband.</i><br> <br> Shane Faris is taller than I remember. Scruffier. More attractive than ever and sporting a sinful smirk that tells me he hears “Yes” too much. Figures.<br> <br> He offers me the divorce I want, but on one condition . . .<br> <br> <i>Two nights together, for old times' sake.</i><br> <br> He’s partied his way through time zones, collecting ink on his skin to commemorate events I wasn’t a part of. While I struggled to earn my degrees, Shane chased fame and made memories without me.<br> <br> <i>It’s time to move on.</i><br> <br> So why does his presence cause my heart to kick up a beat and my cheeks to blush when he sends me a wink? I can’t resist him. And he is my husband, after all, if only for a few more days. <br> <br> When one night becomes two lines on a pregnancy test, we must decide whether this is a second chance worth taking together.</p>";
