window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>All Twig Starfig wants is to settle into mated life with his wizard and be a good leader to his clan. No drama. No heartache. A happily-ever-after fit for a dragon. Or half-dragon, at any rate.</p> <p>Instead, Twig and Quinn get roped into a new case involving missing orc stones. Yes, those really are a thing. Twig’s dad is on the PR warpath...again. Quinn's little brother can't seem to stop pining over their housemate. Someone - or something - seems to be following them. And getting quality time alone with his wizard is more difficult than keeping one’s virginity at an incubus party.</p> <p>To make matters worse, Twig's old enemies start dropping like fairyflies, and they find themselves smack in the middle of an inconvenient murder investigation with a certain red fury as the main suspect. With everyone in Lighthelm convinced of Bill’s guilt - and by Twig’s association - Starfig Investigations is on the case.</p> <p>Is there no one in the Elder Realm who’s fairy and impartial?</p>";
