window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I always thought I’d die crushed under the weight of my TBR pile, but my death was a plot twist I didn’t see coming. Save your sympathy! Now that I’m dead, I’m living my best freaking life. I’m free to read books for hours on end without worrying about food, rent, or, well, any interruptions.</p> <p>I might finally be able to get through my TBR list… maybe. The only one who can see me in my ghostly form is Wasabi, an adorable rat that lives in the library archives. At least, he was the only one until three not-quite-human guys walked into my life. It started with Rhodes wandering into the library and noticing me admiring his gorgeous body—something that should’ve been impossible since no one could see me. Was it possible to die twice… this time from embarrassment?</p> <p>The guys have come to my small town to figure out why so many lost souls are gathering here, and they want my help. I can’t deny their touch is addictive, and the fact they are willing to share is intriguing, but I prefer to keep my drama inside the pages of a book.</p> <p>My TBRs aren’t going to read themselves, and these men are becoming a distraction I don’t need or want.</p> <p>Although, maybe after just one more chapter, I could take a quick break…TBR is a standalone that may become a series in the future, however this book ends with a HEA. No cliffhangers to be found here! If you are obsessed with your TBR list, like hot guys who are determined to get their girl, enjoy laughing at inappropriate times, and love steam... then you should definitely add this book to your TBR, or better yet, go ahead and listen to it! *Duet Narration by Bridget Bordeaux &amp; Jake Bordeaux*</p>";
