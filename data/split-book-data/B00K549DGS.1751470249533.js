To be fair, the percentage of people actually asking to be murdered is probably small enough to be safely ignored, but he felt it was worth stating regardless. His life might have been ordinary, but it was his life and he wasn't done with it yet. </p><p>Quin didn't care. </p><p>A 1,700-year-old Roman, Quintus Livius Saturnius had a different view of morality than most people. Killing Matheus and hijacking his undead existence seemed perfectly acceptable to him. </p><p>Now, Matheus spends his nights running for his life, questioning his sexual orientation, and defying a mysterious new threat to the vampires within his city. Not that he set out to do any defying; he just wanted to be left alone. Unfortunately, that was never going to happen. </p><p>Volume One of Real Vampires Don't Sparkle </p><p>Fans of <i>Real Vampires Don't Sparkle</i> should be sure to check out more titles from Curiosity Quills Press: <i>Sweet Dreams Are Made of Teeth</i>, by Richard Roberts: a fantasy coming-of-age story set in the world of our dreams, where a nightmare learns who he is - and who he loves. </p><p><i>The Devil You Know</i>, by K.
