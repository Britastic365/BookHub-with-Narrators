window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Five hundred years ago, I fell in love with a vampire. It was a crimson fever that consumed me. I gave up my home, my family, and my pack to be with her. She obliterated my heart at the first opportunity.</p> <p>Our fates are bound whether I like it or not. If she dies, I die.</p> <p>She may have a death wish, but I don't. When she decides to risk everything for revenge, I have no choice but to stop her and find a way to be free of the vow I made. But surviving the dangers of Ellnesari together might not have the outcome I expect. Instead of freedom, I learn who Manu Della Morte truly is, and that reignites a passion I thought I had lost.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
