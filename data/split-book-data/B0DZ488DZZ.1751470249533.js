In fact, he's the last guy on earth I can see myself with…</b></p> <p>Worse: he fires me with no warnings for a totally stupid reason. Rude!</p> <p>If I thought he was a jerk when I worked for him, that's nothing to the way Kivrayn makes my blood boil now. So I went to work for his biggest rival, looking for my opportunity to have my revenge.</p> <p>It's like he goes out of his way to make me uncomfortable: glaring at me across a crowded auction room; frequenting my favorite coffee spot. He even turns up on the only date I've had in months and completely ruins it! What a prick!</p> <p>Only, the more we keep running into each other, the more I start to wonder if the heat in his stare is more than hatred.</p> <p>When a drunken hate f*ck turns my world upside down, it's time to admit that the fire between us is explosive in the bedroom. But that's hardly a good basis for a relationship, and dragons mate for life. Have I bitten off more than I can chew?</p> <p>I can't be bound to the grumpiest, bossiest monster I've ever met, for the rest of my life…</p>";
