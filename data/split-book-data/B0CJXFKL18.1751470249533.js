window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When she breaks her own rule and takes a job working for a CEO, he’ll show her that money doesn’t matter when it comes to the heart. <br> <br> As a poor girl who went to a private school filled with rich kids who made fun of me, I’ve since avoided anyone who has a lot of money. But when I’m offered a temp job as the assistant to a business tycoon that pays very well, I can’t pass it up. The extra cash will help me secure a down payment on the perfect location for my new business.<br> <br> I arrive at my workplace with my armor in place and a professional smile on my face, but Seth Crawford is not what I expected. He doesn’t look like a CEO or act like a CEO, and he doesn’t treat me like he’s the CEO. And when I accompany him on a business trip, he shows me what it would be like to be more than his assistant.<br> <br> But playing pretend outside of the office can’t last forever. In the real world, he’ll never see me as his equal, and unfortunately, neither will I.</p>";
