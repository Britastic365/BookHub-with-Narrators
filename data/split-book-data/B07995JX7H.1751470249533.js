Lovers on the brink. </p> <p><i>A Charm of Magpies, Book 3:</i> With the justiciary understaffed, a series of horrifying occult murders to be investigated, and a young student who is flying - literally - off the rails, magical law enforcer Stephen Day is under increasing stress. And his relationship with his aristocratic lover, Lord Crane, is beginning to feel the strain. Crane chafes at the restrictions of England's laws, and there's a worrying development in the blood-and-sex bond he shares with Stephen. A development that makes a sensible man question if they should be together at all. </p> <p>When a thief strikes at the heart of Crane's home, a devastating loss brings his closest relationships into bitter conflict - especially his relationship with Stephen. And as old enemies, new enemies, and unexpected enemies paint the lovers into a corner, the pressure threatens to tear them apart. </p> <p><i>Warning:</i> Contains hot-blooded sex, cold-blooded murder, sinister magical goings-on, and a lot of swearing. </p>";
