I am Leandra Del Rossa...his wife.</b></p> <p>Alexius Del Rossa made me an offer I couldn’t refuse.</p> <p>A temporary arrangement. One that would benefit us both.</p> <p>Be his wife for six months so he can solidify his legacy, and I walk away with the security of having the Del Rossa name.</p> <p>Now I realize that it’s no longer that simple—not while his every command bends my will and entices me to obey. We’ve become each other’s poison—a toxic mix of his wicked touch and my dark desires.</p> <p>By day I’m the woman who walks by his side, and by night I’m the toy who kneels at his feet. He’s given me a taste of how it feels to indulge without limits, a glimpse of what life would be like as the queen of his empire.</p> <p>But I can’t ignore the warnings. The subtle stir of whispers that nothing is as it seems. Even though Alexius helped me conquer my demons once…I’m afraid my husband might just be the real monster I should fear.</p>";
