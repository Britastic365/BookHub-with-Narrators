window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Correctional officers get a bad rep. But in our case, it's fully justified. We're not good people. We're guard dogs. As twisted as the inmates we patrol, courtesy of the monster who created us. Prisoners ourselves on an island of manipulation, we've spent years drowning in vices to dull reality. If these walls could talk, I'm telling you, they'd scream. </p> <p>They call me Velle, but that's Officer Chevelle to you. Hands dirtier than my mind, I have no qualms with staying ruthless to keep these creatures in line. And I'm not alone... Joy Jameson is my partner in crime, and my ex. Together we rule Alabaster Isle like Bonnie and Clyde, only prettier and far more dangerous. It's the two of us against this wicked, secluded world. Until he shows up... </p> <p>Although we need him, the rookie is a problem. Flipping me upside down, using my own hidden desires to tempt me. Rook... with his green eyes and country boy smile... He has no business luring me into something that will get everyone hurt. Let it be known, denying myself while dominating this role is my default setting. But with him in the picture, I'm struggling to keep it intact. The mask is slipping, control I can't lose wavering as we welcome our newest psycho to the roster. Let's hope, for all our sakes, Inmate #101 doesn't do anything stupid.</p> <p>**Joyless is the second book in the Alabaster Penitentiary series. It is a dark M/M/F romance, with HEA. Each book in this series is technically a standalone, though they are interconnected, so it will be recommended to enjoy in order. Joyless is intended for mature audiences and open-minded listeners.
