window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>He's coming for you.</b></p> <p>Death is meant to come on a chariot of broken dreams or in the dark trenches of a storm, not in love letters and gifts.</p> <p>He did not take my soul when I was meant to die. He did not want it all the other times that I've offered it to him on a silver platter. Yet, time and time again, he reminds me that I am his: His night monster, his dark love, his perfect other.</p> <p>Death was the only thing keeping me alive. He watches me from his corner, taunts me with sweet messages, marks my body with his touch as I sleep.</p> <p>He took the people that I love away from me. Still, no one believed me when I said that I saw the faceless man on the night of the accident.</p> <p>No one can escape death.</p> <p>Me? I'm chasing it.</p> <p><i>Cover design by Manuela Williams.</i></p>";
