But there was one - Gregori, the Dark One - who held her in terrifying thrall. Whose cold silver eyes and heated sensuality sent shivers of danger, of desire, down her slender spine. </p> <p>With a dark magic all his own, Gregori - the implacable hunter, the legendary healer, the most powerful of Carpathian males - whispered in Savannah's mind that he was her destiny. That she had been born to save his immortal soul. And now, here in New Orleans, the hour had finally come to claim her. To make her completely his. In a ritual as old as time...and as inescapable as eternity. </p>";
