window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Evie's requests in life are simple. She wants her stolen memories restored and for her Aunt Birdie to live up to her promise to train her in the mystical ways of magic. It might be nice, too, if no one died anytime soon. Unfortunately, that hope is dashed when the mayor turns up dead in his boat on beautiful Lake Skipper. At least he died from natural causes. Or did he?</p> <p>When Birdie does agree to start her witchy lessons, Evie's beyond excited, but she soon discovers that magically sweeping floors isn't the dazzling spell she'd hoped for. Still, all witches have to start somewhere, right?</p> <p>Evie would like to keep the town's handsome police chief Caden at arm's length, but he seems to be the only reliable link to her forgotten summer. And she's not the only one with man troubles. When Aunt Birdie ends with not one, but two suitors, Evie fears her aunt's involved in a kitty love triangle, and everyone knows those don't end well.</p> <p>It's another exciting and unpredictable adventure for Evie. As she searches for who might have committed the murderous deed, she uncovers clues to her own mysterious past, and she discovers that the fiery magic burning in her veins might be more than she can handle.</p>";
