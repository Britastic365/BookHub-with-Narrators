But when her naughty hellhound lands her in trouble and she’s blackmailed into catching a killer, Sam finds herself in the crosshairs of the very beings that want her dead.</p> <p>Run to Hel and give up all the earthly pleasures she’s learned to love? Stay and face a certain death? Or use her impish wiles to and hope to survive? Satan's Sword - Bound by an angel, Sam is the only demon allowed to walk among the humans and live - if she follows the rules. But when Sam’s brother, Dar, finds himself in hot water, following the rules becomes impossible.</p> <p>Retrieve an artifact from the vampires. Save Dar from centuries of enslavement and torture. All it takes is for her to perform a simple courier job, but with demons nothing is simple - especially when Sam must comply with the restrictions her angel has placed on her or face a punishment worse than death Elven Blood - Samantha Martin is an imp, a lesser demon from Hel. She has been living under the radar, posing as a human for the last 40 years, but now that she’s bound to an angel and holds the title of Iblis her life is...complicated.</p> <p>Sam has become buried in angelic bureaucracy, saddled with a succubus house guest, and is fighting off a never-ending slew of demon hit-men. The powerful demon, Haagenti, won’t rest until she’s dragged back to Hel for “punishment”, and he has put a substantial price on her head – a price that threatens not only her, but the human she’s grown to love. When an elven lord offers to take care of Haagenti in return for tracking down and killing a demon half-breed, Sam thinks she’s found the solution to her most pressing problem. But finding and retrieving this hybrid monster isn't proving easy and time is running out</p>";
