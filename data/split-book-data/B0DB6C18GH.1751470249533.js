window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The third and final installment of the Hollow's Row series.</p> <p>Halen:</p> <p>I’ve created a monster. When past and present collide, the fallout feels like the death of my morality. Every time I look into Kallum’s clashing, feverish eyes, I see a dark omen—the threat of what we’ll do to each other if our desires run wild.</p> <p>While the Hollow’s Row case comes to a head, a new heinous player enters the scene. As the Alchemist threatens the town, I’m torn between a promise to help my friend, and my loyalty to Kallum—the man who has sacrificed everything for me.</p> <p>I’ve created a monster—but he’s my monster. And if I can’t control Kallum’s chaotic nature, I’ll lose him…just as I’ve lost everyone I’ve loved.</p> <p>There could be a future for us, but only if we don’t damn ourselves first.</p> <p>Kallum:The moment Halen St. James crashed my world, I made a vow to harbor her darkness, the lovely spark who ignited my black soul. But now, it’s time for Halen to finally step out of her shadows.</p> <p>I would do—and have done—anything to keep her mine. I’ve become a villain to protect her. Even from herself.</p> <p>When she looks into my eyes with recognition, I’m a man reborn, redeemed by her cleansing fire. Only there’s a vital piece of our story missing, and without it, I’ll always fear losing her—a primal fear that provokes the demon within.</p> <p>The truth lies somewhere in the murky marsh waters, where killers and philosophers intwine, obscuring ancient wisdoms and feasting on the sweetest nectar.</p> <p>I was created for her, to devour her heartbreak, and she was designed for me, the muse to the devil himself.</p> <p>CW: Full list can be found on author's website.</p>";
