window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Listeners met the irrepressible Karen Memory in Elizabeth Bear's 2015 novel <i>Karen Memory</i> and fell in love with her steampunk Victorian Pacific Northwest city and her down-to-earth storytelling voice. Now Karen is back with <i>Stone Mad</i>, a new story about spiritualists, magicians, con men, and an angry lost tommy-knocker - a magical creature who generally lives in the deep gold mines of Alaska but has been kidnapped and brought to Rapid City. </p> <p>Karen and Priya are out for a night on the town, celebrating the purchase of their own little ranch and Karen's retirement from the Hotel Ma Cherie, when they meet the Arcadia Sisters, spiritualists who unexpectedly stir up the tommy-knocker in the basement. The ensuing show could bring down the house, if Karen didn't rush in to rescue everyone she can.</p>";
