window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Welcome to Nocturne Falls, the town that celebrates Halloween 365 days a year. The tourists think it's all a show: the vampires, the werewolves, the witches, the occasional gargoyle flying through the sky. But the supernaturals populating the town know better. Living in Nocturne Falls means being yourself. Fangs, fur, and all. </p> <p>For romance writer Roxy St. James, living in Nocturne Falls also means a fresh start. And as soon as her unbearable ex signs the divorce papers, that new beginning will be a reality. Unfortunately, her ex doesn't seem ready to let her go and the subtle threats he's been making leave her no choice but to confide in her oh-so-handsome neighbor, who just happens to be a deputy with the sheriff's department. But Officer Alex Cruz isn't just the law. He's also a panther shifter, a secret he's sworn to keep (along with the truth about Nocturne Falls) from the very foxy Roxy. Humans aren't supposed to know the town is filled with supernaturals. Then she starts seeing things she shouldn't and thinks she's losing her mind. His attraction - and concern - for her wars with the promise he's made. Will his truth be more than she can handle? Or will it cause her to write him out of her life? </p>";
