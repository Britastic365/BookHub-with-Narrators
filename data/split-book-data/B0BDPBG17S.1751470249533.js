window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A M/M Vampire Series with a Twist.</b></p> <p><b>Ezra thinks his job sucks eggs. </b></p> <p>My team of former angels—now vampires—won't make an effort to get along or follow orders. Kaziel, our master, is a jerk who rarely takes any interest in the nest's progress or lack thereof. Michael, my former archangel, refuses to hear my petition to return to The Realm of Light so I can plead my case. I should never have been banished and sent to Earth.</p> <p>To top things off, I've been told another new recruit is about to get kicked through the portal. As usual, I'm the one who'll have to mentor the newbie and see him through the difficult transition to vampire. This one's a healer from Raphael's legion. Ha! I wish him luck. This thrown-together bunch can't even agree on the time. </p> <p><b>Asher is excited to take a temporary journey to the mortal realm.</b></p> <p>I've healed angels from all four legions, becoming one of Raphael’s top healers. Now there’s a job for me on Earth in the town of Santa Cruz, part of the new territory of Costa Larga. I haven’t been given any information as to what I’ll be doing, but that’s never hindered me before.</p> <p>Ezekiel, Michael's third in command, is one of the six angels I’ll be working with. A male I've admired since I first came through the aether and grew my wings. This explains why he’s been out of sight for five years. He too must have been assigned a job on Earth.</p> <p>A clerk from Uriel’s legion shoves me toward an open door. Michael's second in command greets me holding a bloody sword. I clutch the small bag of favorite possessions closely to my chest and tremble as doubt floods my mind. What fate truly awaits me?</p>";
