My uncle's ready to retire, and he has always dreamed of me taking over his partnership at the animal clinic in town.</p> <p>My surprise came when he introduced me to my new partnerâ€”and it's the cute guy I was talking to at the coffee shop. It's okay, though. I'm not looking for a relationship. My priorities are my career and starting over.</p> <p>Ivan and I clash at every turn, and our transition is anything but smooth. Throw in the exotic animals that keep showing up, and I think we're doomed. The one thing we can agree on is to make my uncle proud.</p> <p>When Ivan starts to open up to me, it's difficult to ignore my feelings. Throw in turtle-shelled glasses, and I'm putty. I'm tempted to break my rule, but I know the consequences that come with dating a co-worker, and I won't go through that again.</p> <p><i>The Nice Guy </i>is a diverse, closed-door romantic comedy full of swoony moments, laughs, and a meddling Cuban family. The It's Amor Rom-Com series follows Cuban-American cousins as they find unexpected love. You'll get sizzling chemistry without the spice.</p>";
