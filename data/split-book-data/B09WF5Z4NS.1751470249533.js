window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Lies, love, lust and power. Bestselling author Ella Fields delivers a sexy, wickedly addictive dark fantasy romance.</p> <p>All my life, I’d known my marriage would be arranged. What I never expected was to fall in love.</p> <p>My betrothed was arrogance dressed in royal finery, and I longed to both disappear and step closer whenever he entered the room.</p> <p>As princess of the Moon Kingdom, and daughter of the cruelest king our land had ever seen, I was well-versed in deceit and debauchery. The Sun Kingdom’s sly prince was no threat to me.</p> <p>Assuming that was a grave mistake. For the ever-present smirk, irritating charm, and adoring gleam in his eyes began to melt the ice encasing my heart.</p> <p>All too soon, hatred turned to love. I was captured by something I’d rarely experienced before—happiness.</p> <p>But I should’ve known better.</p> <p>After all, I’d been raised by a monster. And little did I know I was about to marry one.</p>";
