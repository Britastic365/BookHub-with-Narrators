window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An infuriatingly irresistible love story. </b></p> <p>Michelle Anders is done with love. Done with the involuntary heart palpitations and suffocating in breathless moments. Done crying over a man who doesn't deserve her. She's determined to become a strong, independent woman, starting with focusing on what really matters. Herself. </p> <p>The solitary week of relaxation she planned at a friend's remote lake house turns unbearable when the man who broke her heart stumbles in on her. While she's stark naked in the bathtub. With his pants around his ankles! </p> <p>Drew Wright may be the NFL's newest darling, but to Michelle the jock is nothing but a loud-mouthed, crass, country-boy brute. He doesn't deserve a second of her time...but the things he can do to her body are irresistible. </p> <p>When mother nature conspires to keep them locked up together, Michelle needs to figure out where lust ends and love begins.</p>";
