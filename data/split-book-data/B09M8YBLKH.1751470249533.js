People'd live for ages side by side, nodding at one another amicably on their way to work, and then some trivial thing would happen and someone would be having a garden fork removed from their ear.'</i><br> <br> When the neighbours in question are the proud empires of <b>Klatch </b>and <b>Ankh-Morpork</b>, those are going to be some pretty large garden tools indeed. Of course, no-one would dream of starting a war without a perfectly good reason...such as a 'strategic' piece of old rock in the middle of nowhere.<br> <br> It is after all every citizen's right to bear arms to defend their own. Even if it isn't <i>technically </i>their own. And even if they don't have much in the way of actual weaponry. As two armies march, <b>Commander Vimes</b> of Ankh-Morpork <b>City Watch</b> faces unpleasant foes who are out to get him... and that's just the people on his side. The enemy might be even worse.<br> <br> <i>The Discworld novels can be listened to in any order but </i><b><i>Jingo </i></b><i>is the fourth book in the City Watch series.</i><br> <br> <b>'Generous, amusing and the ideal boarding point for those who have never visited Discworld' </b><i>Sunday Telegraph</i><br> <br> </p>";
