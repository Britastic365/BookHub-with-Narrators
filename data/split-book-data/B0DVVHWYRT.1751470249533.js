window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>AN ALL-NEW UNABRIDGED RECORDING NARRATED BY LORELEI KING!<br> <br> From Janet Evanovich, the “most popular mystery writer alive” (</b><b><i>The New York Times</i></b><b>), comes the fourth novel in the entertaining and enthralling Stephanie Plum series.</b><br> <br> Working for her bail bondsman cousin Vinnie, Stephanie is hot on the trail of revenge-seeking waitress Maxine Nowicki, whose crimes include bail jumping, theft, and extortion. Someone is terrifying Maxine’s friends, and those who have seen her are turning up dead. Also on the hunt for Maxine is Joyce Barnhardt, Stephanie’s archenemy and rival bounty hunter.<br> <br> Stephanie’s attitude never wavers—even when aided by crazy Grandma Mazur, ex-hooker and wannabe bounty hunter Lula, and transvestite rock musician Sally Sweet—and even when Stephanie makes an enemy whose deadly tactics escalate from threatening messages to firebombs. All of this pales in comparison, though, with an even greater danger Stephanie faces, when, homeless and broke, she and her hamster Rex move in with a vice cop Joe Morelli.</p>";
