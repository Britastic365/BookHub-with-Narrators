window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>What good is power if you can't control it?</b></p> <p>The daughter of two legendary air witches, I'm supposed to be the best of my generation. In theory, I should be able to bend the wind to my will. In practice, I'm more likely to accidentally trigger a hurricane. To prove myself, I have to capture the North Wind—the most volatile force on earth. As far as quests go, I expect it to suck.</p> <p>What I don't expect is to meet my fated mate in the form of a smooth-talking Scottish Highlander. Callum McLeish is half-dragon and half-incubus. He's also drop-dead gorgeous and determined to follow me to the frozen wastes. It's cold in the North, but my new protector sets my nights ablaze.</p> <p>Things take a scorching turn when we arrive in the wastes and meet Graeme Abernathy. As a member of the Brotherhood of Ice Dragons, Graeme took vows to live a solitary life. His heart is frozen, and his attitude is as chilly as his castle.</p> <p>But dragons mate in threes. And the more time Callum and I spend around Graeme, the harder it is to deny the pull between us. Graeme isn't supposed to feel anything. So why does he feel so perfect to Callum and me?</p> <p>Still, there's something unsettling in the air. As things heat up between the three of us, danger does as well. Graeme has secrets—and a past that refuses to die. As the temperature plunges, the stakes couldn't be higher. If I don't unravel the mystery that swirls around Graeme, I could lose both of my men forever.</p>";
