window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Two mortal enemies. One hot, fated love. The dominant wolf shifter never thought I'd fall onto his doomed planet. When I do, he thinks it's the best day of his life. It's the worst for me.</p> <p>I escaped being a breeder to a cruel king, only to have my spaceship crash on the arena where nine clans fight to the death to claim me. I flee the ship, but Antonio tracks me down. He f--ks me, believing I'm his mate, but when he finds out who I truly am - a leopard princess whose father slaughtered his family - he looks at me with hatred. Yet he can't let me go. His body craves mine too much, but his pack won't allow me to live.</p> <p>He must choose - put down his fated mate or defend me and lose everything.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
