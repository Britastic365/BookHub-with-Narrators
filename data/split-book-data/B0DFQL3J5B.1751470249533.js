Driving back, she pulled in at a convenience store—and walked right into a robbery in progress. One gunshot from a jittery thief was about to change her world.</p> <p>After being shocked back to life on the operating table, she has a long recovery ahead, so she moves back to her parents’ peaceful house in Heron’s Rest. As for the boyfriend who dumped her via text while she was in the hospital, good riddance.</p> <p>She may be down, but she’s not out. So when a woman vanishes, leaving her car behind in a supermarket parking lot, Sloan searches online for similar cases. She finds them, spread across three states. Men and women, old and young—the missing seem to have nothing in common. And the abductions keep happening.</p> <p>Luckily, the new man in her life shares her passion for solving this mystery. But it will take every ounce of endurance to get to the dark heart of this bizarre case—and she's willing to risk her life again if that's what it takes to stop the horror.</p> <p><b>\"Narrator January LaVoy brings a richly layered performance to a story.... She expertly handles the large cast of multigenerational characters\"—</b><b><i>AudioFile</i></b><b> on </b><b><i>Hideaway</i></b></p> <p><b>A Macmillan Audio production from St. Martin’s Press.</b></p>";
