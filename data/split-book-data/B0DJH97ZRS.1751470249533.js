window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>INSTANT </b><b><i>USA TODAY</i></b><b> BESTSELLER</b></p> <p><b>A LibraryReads Pick</b></p> <p><b>Rivalry and romance spark when two bookstore managers who are opposites in every way find themselves competing for the same promotion.</b></p> <p>Despite managing bookstores on the same Boston street, Josie Klein and Ryan Lawson have never interacted much—Josie’s store focuses on serious literature, and Ryan’s sells romance only. But when the new owner of both stores decides to combine them, the two are thrust into direct competition. Only one manager will be left standing, decided by who turns the most profit over the summer.</p> <p>Efficient and detail-oriented Josie instantly clashes with easygoing and disorganized Ryan. Their competing events and contrasting styles lead to more than just frustration—the sparks between them might just set the whole store on fire. Their only solace during this chaos is the friendship they’ve each struck up with an anonymous friend in an online book forum. Little do they know they’re actually chatting with each other.</p> <p>As their rivalry heats up in real life, their online relationship grows, and when the walls between their stores come tumbling down, Josie and Ryan realize not all’s fair in love and war. And maybe, if they’re lucky, happily ever afters aren’t just for the books.</p>";
