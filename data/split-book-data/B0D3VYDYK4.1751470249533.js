window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>*This is a Duet Novel—two novellas in one book<br> Two Spicy Stories in one book. In Having the Dae’mon’s Baby, Ketha decides to skip the Contraception Center and get pregnant the old fashioned way—by letting her new Kindred Bodyslave penetrate her. But will she get more than she bargained for?<br> In Her Kindred Dom, Addison decides she wants her stern Kindred boss as her Daddy Dom, but will the big Beast Kindred give her more than she can handle?<br> Find out when you listen, Dae’mons and Doms, the latest Kindred Tales book<br> <br> <br> Book 1—Having the Dae’mon’s Baby<br> Ketha has a dull, dissatisfying life and to make matters worse, her mother is pressuring her to have a baby to carry on their family dynasty. Ketha doesn’t feel ready for the responsibility…until her mother buys a male bodyslave to serve them--a Dae’mon Kindred.<br> <br> Huge and muscular with curving horns, he’s like nothing Ketha has ever seen before…she feels immediately drawn to him and decides to use him for her own ends. Her mother wants her to have a baby? Fine—but she’s not going to the Conception Center to have artificial insemination. Instead, she wants to get pregnant in the most forbidden way possible—by letting a male penetrate her.<br> <br> But can Ketha give her body without giving her heart?<br> You’ll have to read Having the Dae’mon’s Baby to find out…<br> *TROPES--Primal Need, Br33ding, Enemies to Lovers<br> <br> Book 2—Her Kindred Dom<br> Addison Davis has a crush on her boss, Commander Courick, the huge Beast Kindred who runs the HKR building in downtown Tampa. She’s sure he would make the perfect Dom—unfortunately, he never seems to notice him, no matter what outrageous stunts she pulls. So she has to get her needs met at a BDSM club called The Torture Palace.<br> <br> But when an encounter at the club goes too far and leaves Addison with visible marks on her bottom, Courick finally notices. Angry and protective, he follows her to The Torture Palace to find out who hurt her…only to find out her secret. Addison is a little and she’s not just looking for a Dom—she wants a Daddy Dom.<br> <br> Can Courick handle his curvy assistant’s proclivities and meet her needs or will the vow he took never to call a bride come between them?<br> You’ll have to listen to Her Kindred Dom to find out.<br> TROPES--Office Romance, DD/lg, Who Did This To You?<br> <br> <br> <br> Author’s Note: This second story in this book, Her Kindred Dom, is BDSM and contains some very mild Age Play. (The heroine calls the hero “Daddy” several times but mostly she calls him “Sir.”) I have been wanting to write a Kindred Age Play novel for some time, but I know it’s not everyone’s cup of tea. However, even if you don’t usually like Age Play, I would ask that you give it a chance. It is, as I said, very mild and I think you’ll enjoy it even if this topic isn’t usually your thing. If you’ve seen the movie “Secretary” most of the story is along those lines.<br> Hugs and thanks for reading,<br> Evangeline</p>";
