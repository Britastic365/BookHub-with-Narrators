window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Parker:<br> </p> <p>I haven’t been feeling like myself lately, whoever that is. I haven’t felt like Parker for a long while. There are these moments where I'm terrified of the dark thoughts that plague me, the haunting memories of bright white light followed by excruciating pain. Sometimes when I close my eyes, I can almost imagine I’d lived a different life. In another realm filled with magic and prophecies. It can't be real. My delusions are what put me in the mental institution in the first place. Still, I can't shake the thought that there's something I'm missing.</p> <p>Luna:<br> </p> <p>I had a mate once upon a time. I’d almost Ascended, until I lost him. He's dead, and I'm the one to blame. I made the biggest mistake of my life. There's no going back from it. I was stupid and naive and I regret the decision I made so long ago. I’m now a mother and will no longer trust anyone but myself. I will not be controlled by my duty.</p> <p>In the end, it is Ascension that will unite dark and light. Descension will lead the realm to pure chaos and the regression of the bond that started it all.</p> <p>With featured music by Barrett Marshall ft. Lylli - \"Bloom\"</p>";
