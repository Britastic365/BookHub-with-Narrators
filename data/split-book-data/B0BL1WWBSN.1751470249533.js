My stalker, savior, the man who protected me from all the evil in the world.</b></p> <p>I should’ve trusted him, believed him when he told me he was only trying to keep my safe. I thought the worst was behind me. Little did I know the worst was yet to come. Kidnapped by a man capable of the worst kind of evil, I am thrust into a dark and dangerous world where blood and wealth are the only things that matter.</p> <p>I’m a pawn in the war for power. The man I was desperate to escape from is now the only one that can save me. I’ll do anything to be back in his arms. He saved me once; he’ll do it again.

And what happens when I find I wasn’t just meant to be in this world?</p> <p>I was meant to run it.</p> <p><b>This is a continuation of Cruel Obsession and is </b><b><i>not</i></b><b> a standalone.</b></p>";
