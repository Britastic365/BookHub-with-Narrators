window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In the Ocelot Kingdom, feline shifters rule, and humans are nothing. </b> </p> <p>As a princess, you’d think I lived a blessed life. But like all second-born children of shifter couples, I am a lowly human. The most I can hope for is that when my older sister takes the throne, she’ll consider me unimportant enough to let me marry for love. </p> <p>First, I have to get her to the throne. </p> <p>After a devastating betrayal by our father, I vow to get Camila the crown - now. To become queen, she must collect an amulet that contains secrets to the mating rituals of each feline clan. I’ll do anything to help my fragile sister gain the first amulet, even if it means seducing Lord Balam, a jaguar noble who's as terrifying as he is irresistible. </p> <p>To my surprise, something inside me awakens at his rough treatment and dirty talk. When he introduces me to pleasures beyond my wildest imagination, I am drawn into the secret world of shifters where every man wears two faces and a vulnerable human body like mine is a liability. </p> <p>As we navigate the hidden dangers of the feline world, I must decide how much I’ll give to get my sister to the throne. Because the next amulet may cost not just my body, but my very soul. </p> <p>TW: Contains material and themes not suitable for sensitive listeners.
