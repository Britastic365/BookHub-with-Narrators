Yes, I’m enough of a sap to believe in love at first sight. When I fell for Lucy, I fell <i>hard</i>. Everything was great between us - until the moment she dumped me.</p> <p>Now I just want to forget about her. Instead, I’m stuck staring at her face all day. But I need this job, so I’ll find a way to be civil and professional.</p> <p>There’s just one small problem: I’m nowhere close to being over her.</p> <p><b>First, we were lovers. Then enemies. Now we’re trying to work together. </b></p> <p>I didn’t set out to break Tanner King’s heart, but you know what they say about the road to hell.</p> <p>I’ve got too many responsibilities and no room in my life for love. I can deal with Tanner’s resentment until he starts working at the desk directly across from mine. Obviously, a truce of some kind is required. We’re both grownups. We can handle this situation like professionals.</p> <p>There’s only one thing threatening this fragile peace we’ve negotiated: all these inconvenient feelings I apparently still have for him.</p> <p><i>Cream and Punishment</i> is book two in the King Family series set in the small town of Crowder, Texas, home of the King’s Creamery ice cream company. Each book is a stand-alone, full-length contemporary romance that follows one of the six King siblings as they find and fight for love.</p>";
