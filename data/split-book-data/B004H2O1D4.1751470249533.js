window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A BURIED EGYPTIAN TEMPLE. A SECRET KEPT FOR SIX THOUSAND YEARS. A RACE FOR LIFE WORTH KILLING FOR.</b></p> <p> An international TV audience waits breathlessly as archaeologists prepare to break into a long-hidden vault beneath the Great Sphinx. But archaeology student Macy Sharif has already made her own shocking discovery: a religious cult raiding the site. Their prize? A map that will lead to something far more astounding: the lost pyramid of Osiris. Framed by corrupt officials, Macy goes on the run, trying to reach the only people who can save her before she is silenced---permanently. American archaeologist Nina Wilde---once a renowned scientific explorer, now all but blacklisted by her colleagues---is trying to rebuild her reputation. But Macy's plea for help will send Nina and ex-SAS bodyguard Eddie Chase on the ultimate treasure hunt. From the streets of Manhattan to a yacht off Monaco to a buried desert site, they'll follow an elusive trail stalked by a killer determined to uncover a 6000-year-old secret. And beneath the forbidding desert, they'll enter a forgotten world both wondrous and horrifying, where the ancient God of Death has kept his secrets---until now.</p>";
