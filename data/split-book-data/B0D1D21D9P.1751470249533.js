window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"You have something I want. Something I'll happily buyâ€¦ or rent.\"</b></p> <p>As if my life doesn't suck enough already, my insufferable new roommate, Miller MacAvoy, seems determined to make things weird. He watches me all the time, grinning at me like a beautiful idiot, eyes boring holes into me every time I turn my back on him.</p> <p>It's the last thing I need. Things haven't been going well. College isn't working out at all like I'd hoped. I'm drowning in debt, waiting tables every shift I can get, and falling behind on my studies.</p> <p>Something's got to give. I can't go on like this much longer.</p> <p>Miller, being the out-of-touch rich boy he is, keeps offering to throw cash my way. Obviously, I'd rather die than accept charity from him.</p> <p>Still, he watches and waits. Insisting again and again that I have something he wants to buy. It's insane. I have nothing of value to sell. Absolutely nothing. My phone screen is cracked and my truck could easily be mistaken for scrap.</p> <p>Wait. No! Surely not. He can't possibly be thinking that.</p> <p>Can he?</p>";
