window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When times get tough, the tough stage one scorching-hot intervention. </p> <p>Morgan is happy that her best friend Kate is expecting the crew's littlest member, but helping renovate a room for a nursery is more than she can bear. Baby furniture and pastel paint are a painful reminder that she and Joe can't - and will never - conceive. There's no hiding it from the rest of the close-knit crew, either. True to their unique brand of love, the gang rallies to find a non-traditional solution to alleviate their friends' suffering. Not with a cold, clinical visit to a sperm donation clinic, but delivering it the old-fashioned way. With a healthy dose of searing passion. </p> <p>But soon after Morgan's scorching hot night with her husband's four best friends, an accident threatens the life of one of those men. The challenges that lie ahead will test the crew's powerful bond to the limit-and their long-standing promise to take care of each other through good, bad, and sexy times. Whatever it takes… </p> <p>Warning: Not everything in life turns out as planned, but with love all odds are surmountable. Especially when those odds include five hot construction workers on your side. Contains m/m/f group ménage scenes.</p>";
