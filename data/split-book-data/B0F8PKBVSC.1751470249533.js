window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A mage in hiding. Five men she can't have. A secret she'll die to protect.</b></p> <p>My name is Isabel Gallagher, and I have a secret. I can see ghosts. If anyone discovers my ability, everyone I care about will be killed.</p> <p>To keep my secret, I have to pretend to be magicless. Since mages value power above all else, I'm the town of Hawthorne Grove's favorite punching bag. I only have a year left here. Then, I can move away to a normal human town and forget that other mages exist.</p> <p>My five-year plan of staying alive and remaining undetected is on track. Until one night at the gym, I met them.</p> <p>A pushy alpha wolf, his easygoing younger brother, and their quiet, broody friend. Throw in my too-handsome-for-his-own-good best friend and my mysterious combat teacher, and I'm up to my eyeballs in men who make me wish things could be different.</p> <p>But they can't be.</p> <p>While I'm trying to guard my heart against the men who feel like the missing parts of my soul, young mages all over New England are disappearing. When no one's willing to investigate, I know I have to. But the truths I expose and the betrayals I uncover threaten everything I've spent the last fourteen years trying to protect.</p>";
