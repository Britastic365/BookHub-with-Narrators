window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The title \"Queen of the Labyrinth\" doesn’t come with a crown. It comes with a bright red target on my back.<br> <br> There’s a hit list circulating the prison, offering up large sums of cash for our deaths—me and all of my men. Assassins, serial killers, and murderers...They’re all coming out of the woodwork to collect their prize.<br> <br> Even a queen and her kings can't fight off an entire army.<br> <br> Escape is our only option if we want to survive.<br> <br> No one has ever made it out of the Labyrinth alive, not with the deadly traps and cold-blooded monsters roaming the tunnels.<br> <br> And if that isn’t enough, we also have new challenges to contend with—mysterious voices, a door that likes to disappear, and a new guy with interesting abilities trying to insert himself into our lives.<br> <br> Either we die as shunned royalty, or we die fighting for our lives. This time around, I think we might actually leave Nightmare Penitentiary in body bags.</p> <p>This is the sequel to<i> Blindly Indicted.</i> You must read <i>Blindly Indicted </i>in order to understand this book. This contains strong language, sexual situations, and a reverse harem romance. The men in this book are all hardened criminals and extreme alphas who will do anything and everything for the woman they love. If you don't like your men a little psychotic and blood-thirsty—or a female painfully naïve and innocent who develops an inner strength and softness—then this isn't the book for you.</p>";
