window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Gwendolyn Mary Darling Carlisle's young life has been a saga of misfortune.</b></p> <p>After a tragic accident unexpectedly took her parents, Gwen found herself the sole caregiver for her ailing sister. It's her eighteenth birthday, but with responsibilities weighing heavy, she struggles to find something worth celebrating. Everything in her life has fallen apart. That is until she finds a mysterious man in her bedroom.</p> <p>Peter Pan has returned to the Darling estate. The boy from Neverland, who refused to grow up, has, in fact, grown into an alluring man. It's time for spring cleaning, and he's determined to bring a descendant of Wendy's back to Neverland with him.</p> <p>Gwen is swept off her feet and across the veil to be engulfed in a fantastical world of mermaids, Fae, and Peter's new band of Lost Boys. As she gives herself over to the wonder of Neverland and the affections of Peter and his Lost Boys, she finds herself living out hedonistic fantasies that she could have only ever dreamed about.</p> <p>But not everything is as it seems in Neverland. Her memories of home and her beloved sister are fading. A treasured family heirloom, a locket with its own ties to Neverland, is the only tether to the sister she left behind and the life she is obligated to return to. The fairytales she'd heard as a child only hinted at the truth. Neverland bears some dark secrets.</p>";
