window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Thief of Hearts</i>: Book Three in The Elders and Welders Chronicles </p> <p>The Sahara Desert, 1887: A hotbed of pirates, tomb raiders, and general ne'er-do-wells. Itâ€™s not exactly the ideal place for Hex Bartholomew, dirigible pilot and former child-thief, to go straight. Trouble soon finds her at the mouth of an ancient tomb and in the company of bloody-minded treasure hunters, angry Bedouins, and a resurrected Pharaoh... </p> <p>But Hex is fairly sure Pharaohs don't speak with snooty British accents. </p> <p>\"Mr. Pharaoh\" can remember nothing of who he is or how he managed to find himself in an Egyptian tomb that has been sealed for thousands of years. All he has is a name, Rowan, and some truly disturbing and...well, god-like powers. And an annoying tendency to save Hex's life. </p> <p>The last thing Hex needs is to fall in love with an amnesiac Brit who may or may not be a reincarnated Egyptian god, especially when it becomes obvious that the truth behind who - and what - Rowan is threatens to tear them apart for all of time. It's just not worth the risk to her heart. </p> <p>Until it is...</p>";
