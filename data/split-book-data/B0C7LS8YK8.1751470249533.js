Then Dr. Gillian Fitzpatrick intrudes upon his self-pitying solitude, desperate for his help in rescuing her family from terrorists. Her plea has given Trace an opportunity to use his skills for the right reasons, hope that he is worthy of redemption, and love that he never believed he deserved.</p>";
