window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Play for a husband. Don't fall for his enemies...</b><br> <br> As the second-born princess of a kingdom conquered by a brutal empire, I'm nothing but a pawn. Little do I expect my parents to arrange my marriage to the most powerful bachelor of all: the son of the emperor himself.<br> <br> But when I arrive at the imperial palace, I discover I must compete for my betrothed—vying with the court noblewomen in a series of humiliating trials to prove our devotion.<br> <br> Those who fail will be executed.<br> <br> For the sake of my country, I'll risk my life to win my husband—this sadistic man who applauds the torment and flaunts his lovers.<br> <br> Unfortunately, my scheming competitors aren't my only enemies. The emperor's royal wards—princes of other conquered domains, held hostage to ensure their families' obedience—lurk in the shadows.<br> <br> They see me as a traitor, prostrating myself for our tyrants' approval. The perfect target for their bottled rage. They'll do whatever they can to distract me, unsettle me... ruin me.<br> <br> Forbidden as they are, I can't help being drawn in by their seductive wiles. Behind their simmering fury, their pain and broken hopes call to me.<br> <br> They might be just the allies I need to save my life and my kingdom. But only if I can conquer these wicked men before I lose my heart.<br> <br> *<i>A Game of Veils</i> is the first in a new fantasy romance series with a sizzling enemies-to-lovers romance, smoldering morally grey men, and a determined heroine they'll regret underestimating.*</p>";
