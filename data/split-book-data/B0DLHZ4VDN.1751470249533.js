window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The White Rabbit is following me.</p> <p>I can't outrun him. He's fast, he's ruthless, and if he hadn't drugged me and dragged me off to this godforsaken \"Wonder\" land, I might find his platinum hair and striking rose gold eyes attractive.</p> <p>But here, the only wonder I've been finding is in the gaze of these beautiful men as they watch me run. Never do they try and help. No one wants to risk the wrath of Coello, the vicious White Rabbit himself.</p> <p>Except Mau. The Cheshire Cat, as he calls himself. He may talk in riddles, but he's always popping up when I'm in a dire situation, whether it be with the Twins or the Caterpillar or the Mad Hatter or the Queen of Hearts. I don't know if I can trust him, but what other choice do I have?</p> <p>We're All Mad Here is a reimagining of Alice in Wonderland with a spicy twist. This darker, grittier version of a classic tale will keep you as on edge as our heroine, with touches of horror and heat amidst the twisted romance. You'll love it if you prefer your enemies to lovers romance with multiple possessive, morally gray love interests who love the primal chase of their very, very \"good girl.\"</p>";
