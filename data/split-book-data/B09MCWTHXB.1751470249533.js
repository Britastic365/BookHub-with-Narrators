window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In the Ocelot kingdom, trouble is brewing.</b></p> <p>Upon arriving back home, my mates and I are greeted with unrest in the streets and within the palace itself. I have been labeled a traitor to our nation, and Camila is calling for my head. Not everyone wants me dead, though. In this new world, my supporters are hidden in the shadows, waiting for me to give them a voice.</p> <p>When we’re captured by the king, I’m separated from the men who have stolen my heart and ruled my body for so long. Alone, I must face the monster who raised me - King Ocelot himself. At last, I can ask the questions I have wanted answered for so long. But, as secrets are revealed, and I learn the depths of my father’s barbarism and the truth of who I am, I know it leaves me only one option; I must save the throne from my sister’s dangerous rule and my men from her grips. But, with no amulets in my possession and no royal blood in my veins, what chance do I have?</p> <p>My imprisonment proves a harrowing ordeal that tests my resolve, my strength, my cunning, and the bonds between me and the mates fate has chosen for me. Can we find our way back to each other and onto the throne before everything we’ve worked for is taken from us?</p> <p><b>This is the final book in the Feline Royals series, a dark romance series with triggering scenes, including non-con and assault.</b></p>";
