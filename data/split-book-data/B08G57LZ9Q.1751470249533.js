window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A fun, sexy, suspenseful new series from <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Rebecca Zanetti! </p> <p>Bullets and kisses can burn.</p> <p>The last person Anna Albertini expects to see in an orange jumpsuit in District Court - a place she <i>so </i>doesn't belong as a new prosecuting attorney - is Aiden Devlin, the man who’d saved her life when they were kids. For years, she has dreamed about him. Now here he is - his eyes blue, his chest wide, and his hands in cuffs. </p> <p>Sure, Aiden says he doesn’t want her help, and his ties to a deadly motorcycle club should give her warning. Yes, her new boss is a sexy Italian bad boy who might be using the case to climb to the top. Plus, the detective assigned to the case, with his green eyes and broad shoulders, wants her to stay out of his way. </p> <p>With so much testosterone surrounding her all of a sudden, most women would find it hard to concentrate. This might be why the case leads Anna to yelp during a spa appointment, fall out of a tree, and chase a naked old man around the courtroom. It’s a good thing Anna learned a long time ago to be her own hero, no matter how fast the bullets fly or the kisses consume.</p>";
