She never named her attacker.</p> <p>In New York law that did not constitute homicide.</p> <p>What did constitute homicide was what happened to Chuck Inglewood, when somebody slipped into his house and, with a razor sharp blade, cut through the veins and the arteries in his underarms and his inner thighs, and left him to bleed to death. Why he was murdered was a mystery nobody could solve. Why he didn’t fight back was a deeper mystery.</p> <p>Nothing connected the two cases, except for the simple fact that Chuck Inglewood was Sadie Byrne’s uncle.
