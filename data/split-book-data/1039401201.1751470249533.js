window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>Alma Weber</i></b></p> <p>He told me that he’d destroy me. I knew he wasn’t lying, and I loved him anyway. I believed in love - in him. I just wasn’t prepared to carry the weight of his demons. I wanted forever with him, but life showed me love was temporary, and forever was a dream. Despite everything that happened, even now, I wouldn’t change any of it. For a love to have the capacity to destroy you, it has to be extraordinarily powerful - and that kind of love is impossible to walk away from.</p> <p><b><i>Leo Harding</i></b></p> <p>I warned her that I’d ruin her. I knew that I’d taint her innocence with my bad intentions. I was weak. She was perfection. I was nothing. The truth is that I loved her, and I selfishly wanted to hold on - to her, to the man she had made me, to the life we could have. I wanted to dance with her in the light despite knowing that the darkness would find me anyway. Heartbreak was inevitable. Yet I held on to the sliver of hope that I was wrong, that love really was enough. Destiny isn’t something I buy into, but she makes me want to believe.</p>";
