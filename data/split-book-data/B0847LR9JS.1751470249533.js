window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Lincoln</b></p> <p>This may be my toughest mission yet. None of my SEAL training or my time in the CIA has prepared me for this: a prickly, five-foot-nothing hellcat Jasmin Smith.</p> <p>She was mine. She can fight it all she wanted, but in the end, I would have her every way a man can have his woman. She was a sassy little thing, making me work to bend her to my demands. But I will! I will bend her and tie her to me so tight she would never be able to get free. </p> <p>Only problem is I had to break her first. I had secrets that she needed to know. I have fought to get back here...two years breathing in filth and scum. All for her - my warrior princess. Now, all I had to do is make her remember. </p> <p><b>Jasmin</b></p> <p>My entire life was a lie. Just when I thought I could take no more, I am faced with the most important mission of my life. If I fail, it might cost the one man I have ever loved his life: Lincoln Parker.</p> <p>I was blissfully living my life as a tier one security contractor, shooting guns and killing bad guys. My life was perfect. Almost. I was missing something - a missing piece of time, to be exact. For the last two years, I have tried to remember the details of my capture and torture. Two years willing my brain to remember. </p> <p>Then, he walked into my life. Actually, he pushed his way in. It was hard not to notice him - tall, bossy, and sexy as hell. He had no respect of personal space. He used every opportunity to get close and breathe me in. He demanded my attention, whispering the filthiest words in my ear. That was all it took to have me yielding to his every demand. One secret after another is revealed, lies are exposed, and the missing pieces of the puzzle are finally put together. </p> <p><i>Nightstalker </i>is a high-paced action adventure series. Featuring ex-military bad boys and possessive alpha males who use dirty language! Be advised. </p> <p><b>Warning: Suitable for listeners 18 and above owing to explicit and graphic sexual content and language.</b></p>";
