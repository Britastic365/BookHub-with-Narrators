window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Weak. Useless. Freak.</p> <p>Those are the words used to describe me. I'm an Idol who can't see, and in this savage world where power is everything, being born with a disability makes me an aberration. Idols are the direct descendants of the gods. We're supposed to be perfect.</p> <p>My parents kept me protected behind walls most of my life. They fear I won't survive in the real world. They have no idea what kind of power runs through my veins.</p> <p>Stephan Silverstone - the most perfect Idol I've ever met - does. He's cocky, annoying, and pushes my buttons like no other. But he sees me, the real person behind all the preconceived notions. Without effort, he's breaking all my barriers; he's claiming my heart.</p> <p>When I'm with him, sparks fly. I want to be reckless and forget everything. If only things were that simple. We're both keeping dangerous secrets that could tear us apart. War is coming, and I'm not sure if what we have will survive.</p> <p><b>Contains mature themes.</b></p>";
