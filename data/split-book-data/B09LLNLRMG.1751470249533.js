window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I was a good girl once, but now I dance with devils.</p> <p>Some people wear their heart on their sleeve. I wear vengeance like a suit of armor.</p> <p>I’ve got a list with six names on it. Six people who wronged me, who hurt me, who took everything from me. Six people who turned me into the monster I am now.</p> <p>And I’ve crossed off every name but one.</p> <p>One more name. One more death. Should be simple, right?</p> <p>Yeah, you’d think so. But it turns out revenge is a messy business, and when I end up in the wrong place at the wrong time, I royally piss off four brutal, twisted, gorgeous men.</p> <p>Gage, Priest, Ash, and Knox.</p> <p>Lucky for me, the last name on my list is someone they’ve got their own grudge against, so instead of killing me, they offer me a deal. They’ll give me a chance to exact my vengeance, and in exchange, all they want is....</p> <p><i>Me.</i></p> <p>I’m not stupid. I’ve played this game before. Even though they've agreed to help me, I know they want to punish me, too. They want to toy with me. To let their demons loose on me.</p> <p>But maybe these Kings of Chaos have let my pretty face fool them.</p> <p>Because I'm just as vicious as they are. And I’ve got demons of my own.</p> <p><i>Kings of Chaos is a full length dark new adult romance with enemies-to-lovers/love-hate themes, featuring a slightly psycho heroine and four even more psychotic men.</i> </p>";
