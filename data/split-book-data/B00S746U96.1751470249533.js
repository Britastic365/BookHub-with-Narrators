window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Ignazio Vitale is <i>not</i> a good man. </p> <p>I suspect it the first time I see him, sense the air of danger that surrounds him. He has a way of commanding attention, of taking control, of knowing what I'm thinking before I even do. </p> <p>It's alarming and alluring. It's dark and deadly. It's everything I've ever wanted but the last thing I truly need. <i>Obsession.</i> </p> <p>It doesn't take him long to draw me into his web, charming me into his bed and trapping me in his life, a life I know nothing about until it's too late. He has secrets, secrets I can't fathom, secrets that make it so I can't walk away. I see it sometimes in his eyes, a darkness that's both terrifying and thrilling. He's a monster wrapped up in a pretty package, and what I find when I unmask him changes everything. </p> <p>I want to hate him. </p> <p>Sometimes I do. </p> <p>But it doesn't stop me from loving him, too. </p>";
