Michael Gear and Kathleen O'Neal Gear bring us a gripping disaster thriller.</p> <p>The seas flood their banks. Storms devastate entire continents. Fires envelop the world in darkness. The collapse begins...</p> <p>Anthropologist Anika French makes an explosive discovery: Due to climate change, our world is threatened with collapse in just a few years, and humanity will perish. Anika’s committee chair published her work under his own name, now powerful people will do anything to obtain Anika’s statistical program for their own use.</p> <p>With murder, kidnapping, extortion, and assassination on every side, Dr. Maureen Cole, a team of specialists, and bodyguard Skip Murphy will do everything in their power to keep Anika safe as they struggle with the implications of Anika’s work.
