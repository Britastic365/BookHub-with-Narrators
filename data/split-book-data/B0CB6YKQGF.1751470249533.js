window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>My mother trained me to be numb.</b></p> <p>To keep my volatile emotions carefully locked away.</p> <p>But when my drug-addicted stepfather decides to clear his debt by offering my sister to the Ruthless Mafia Men that run our city, I have no choice but to react.</p> <p>Keeping her safe is the only thing I've ever been good at. And, unlike her, I've already been scarred by the cruelties of our world.</p> <p>So I did the only thing I could do, the only thing that would ensure that they'd never go looking for her. I offered myself to big bad wolves instead.</p> <p>I expected the Reapers to be cruel, to push me beyond my limits, and test me at every turn.</p> <p>What I didn't expect was to like it.</p> <p>Atlas, their powerful leader, knows I don't belong in their world, but he's too caught up in protecting his own secrets to save me. I can see the regret in his eyes every time he looks at me.</p> <p>Ezra, the overly affectionate psycho, looks at me like he wants to eat me—or kill me. Honestly, it's probably a mix of both. And the scariest thing about him is that he doesn't really scare me at all.</p> <p>Cyrus, the Ducati-riding bad boy, is tempting as hell, and he knows it. I refuse to give into his charm, even if he has treated me better than anyone ever has before.</p> <p>Tristan, the grumpy and silent one, might actually hate me. But I don't blame him. Out of everyone, he's the only one who can see how messed up I really am at my core.</p> <p>The men who accepted me as payment for a debt are toying with my head and my heart, but no matter what happens next, there's no turning back.</p> <p>I dug my grave with the Reapers of Caspian Hills, and now it's time to lie in it.</p> <p><i>Fear The Reapers</i> is book one in Lovesick Villains, a dark mafia series where our heroine will end up with multiple love interests. This book ends on a mild cliffhanger, and their story will end with a HEA in book three.</p> <p><i>Intended for mature listeners.</i></p>";
