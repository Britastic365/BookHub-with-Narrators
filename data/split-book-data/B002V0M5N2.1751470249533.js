window.bookSummaryJSON = "Eve Duncan has turned down the job twice already. Her skill and devotion in identifying murder victims and helping bring their killers to justice may be world-renowned, but Eve works exclusively for law enforcement and the families of the innocent - and the man on the other end of the phone is many things, none of them law-abiding or innocent. <p> Little is known about Luis Montalvo, one of the world's most wanted men, except that he is extraordinarily dangerous and that he never takes no for an answer. Now he wants Eve's help in the worst way. He believes they have something in common, and he's about to prove it with a grisly warning.</p> <p> Eve will leave everything and everyone behind, even the man she trusts and loves the most, to travel to Montalvo's luxurious armed compound in the Colombian jungle and identify the skull he has recovered. She has agreed to this devil's bargain to save an innocent family, but also for a reason she can't admit to anyone. For the man in the jungle has promised he can give Eve what she wants most of all: the key to unlocking the darkest and most painful mystery of her past.</p> <p> But as she gets closer to identifying the skull, Eve finds herself caught between two ruthless killers, with no way out. Now, with everything on the line, she must make the most chilling choice of all. And if she's wrong...she's dead.</p>";
