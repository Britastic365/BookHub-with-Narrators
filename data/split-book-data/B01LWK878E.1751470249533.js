window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The dreamscape is a place of magic and mystery and meaning. In that nocturnal realm, ideas, images, sensations and emotions drift on the currents of the unconscious mind. </p> <p>Morpheus the Dream Falcon is most at home in that domain. By night, the one-of-a-kind winged immortal soars on those winds, observing and sometimes even entering the slumbering thoughts of another. By day, he is a highly sought after mercenary feared by his immortal kin both for his unmatched ferocity and his wicked obsidian talons. None of his prey escapes him. </p> <p>Cecilia Ramirez y Aguilera is the one he truly wants. But the striking oracle of the Court of the Light Immortals is closed to the handsome outlaw, even in her dreams. Broken by unimaginable losses, the seer is but a slave, subject to the whims of a master who is mad and without mercy. </p> <p>Drawn together by fate, their impossible passion ignites. But will that be enough to overcome the dangerous secrets each keeps from the other? Or will mistrust and the desire for revenge threaten to unravel the powerful magic that binds them? </p>";
