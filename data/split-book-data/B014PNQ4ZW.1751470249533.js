window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Nicola Price used to have it all - a great career, the perfect boyfriend, an excessive shoe collection, and an apartment in one of San Francisco's best neighborhoods. But when she gets knocked up and her asshat boyfriend leaves her high and dry, Nicola's perfectly crafted world comes tumbling down. Now Nicola is the proud single mother of a five-year-old daughter and living a giant lie. She can barely afford their ghetto apartment, and all the men she dates run when they hear that she comes with a child. She's struggling and scared - and nowhere near where she thought she'd be at age 31. Nicola's saving grace comes in the form of tall, handsome, and wealthy Scotsman Bram McGregor, the older brother of her friend, Linden. Bram understands a thing or two about pride, so when tragic circumstances place Nicola at rock bottom, he offers them a place to live in the apartment complex he owns. But nothing in life is free, and as Nicola gets her feet back on the ground, she discovers that the enigmatic playboy may end up costing her more than she thought. She might just lose her heart. </p>";
