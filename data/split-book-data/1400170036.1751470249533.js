window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Carnage is a Gargoyle. He's also volatile, dangerous, unpredictable, and lonely. One evening minding his own business at the edge of the sanctuary he calls home, he spies a female. A human female, and she's running headlong into his swamps, with no regard for her own safety. Then he sees the reason; three men, and they're hot on her trail, torches in hand, hell bent on catching her before she can get away. </p> <p>He watches as they get closer and closer to her, easily following her trail. Carnage makes a snap decision that changes both their lives forever; he drops out of a tree right behind her, slaps one clawed hand over her mouth to keep her from screaming, wraps her in his huge arms and goes right back to the treetops. He shelters her while the men traverse the ground below, unable to determine why her trail disappeared. </p> <p>Carnage admires this little female - she was brave to run into the swamps alone. There are many creatures lying in wait for just such a meal. But she no longer has to worry about that, because now she's his. He only hopes that she doesn't fear him too much once she gets a good look at his blue-grey skin, his fangs, and his horns. Because regardless of what she thinks, or the rules of his community - he's not giving her up. </p> <p><b><i>Contains mature themes.</i></b></p>";
