window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In a god blessed realm where greed is the faith of rulers, Snowlin's existence was perhaps the greediest act of all.</b></p> <p>Born the forbidden child of two Aura, magical beings possessing god-gifted powers, she carries a burden of title. Prized a weapon of destruction by her father and hunted as a monster of carnage by others. The odds knew no favor to the wicked or kind in Numengarth, but Snowlin turned human, powerless, and a disappointment to the creator who intended to wield her in his claim for power over the continent.</p> <p>After twelve years disparaged into exile, she sets to return and claim what the realm owed her: revenge on both her father and the night king who hunted to take more than her life.</p> <p>Take and destroy were her plans.</p> <p>Use and bargain were his.</p> <p>She returns to find the rapacity of serpents lingering in the air and at her expense once again. Snowlin, now arranged to wed her nightmare for a political agreement, begins adjusting plans.</p> <p>While caught in a game of crowns, what would she choose to become? Pawn to the winter king or queen to the night king?</p>";
