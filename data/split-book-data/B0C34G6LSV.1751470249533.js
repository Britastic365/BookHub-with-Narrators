window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Jack: You would think that rescuing my boss and helping deliver her happily-ever-after would earn me a few points with Karma, or at least a couple nights off, but luck has never been on my side. I’ve got to make my own way in this new reality: my Mistress is dead, but Maya needs help fighting off other vampire gangs, a sacred warrior is after me for my part in their partner’s death, I’ve got a bloodslave following me like a pup, Francesca is breathing down my neck, the Dark Ink staff are in revolt, and the perpetual temptation of Zach is right next door. Oh, and Paco’s going to become a vampire in three nights. I guess no good deed goes unpunished. Especially when you’re already dead. Welcome to Dark Ink Tattoo, where needles aren't the only things that bite.</p>";
