Before she reached into the darkness and made me smile for the first time in years. Before I fell like a star from the sky for her clever mind and incomparable heart.</p> <p>Too bad we were doomed from the start. She’ll never forgive me for the lies I’ve told, and I can’t love a woman whose brother destroyed my family. I already know how this ends - in pain and chaos. But I’ve underestimated my true enemy and how far he’s willing to go to ensure Trudy and I never live happily ever after.</p> <p>Warning: <i>Saving Sterling</i> is the third installment in a three-book serial romance. It’s a dark, dirty, boundary-pushing romance that ends in a happily ever after.</p>";
