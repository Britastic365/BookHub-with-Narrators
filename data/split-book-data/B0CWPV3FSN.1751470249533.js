window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>She's the coach's daughter and his rival's newest target.</b></p> <p>Aasher Matthews is everything I detest. Arrogant jock: check. Coy smirk: check. Too hot for his own good: check. To make matters worse, he plays hockey. Unfortunately for him, my father is his coach. Fortunately for me, I'm deemed untouchable.</p> <p>The only common ground I have with hockey players is our love of the ice, so staying away from them will be easy-peasy. Until I overhear their bet—who can get Coach's daughter in their bed first?</p> <p>I'm ready to bring the entire Bexley U hockey team to their knees. Instead of fleeing, I flirt. Instead of hiding, I run just so they'll chase me. Luring my father's players into a trap has a certain appeal to it.</p> <p>Except, Aasher isn't fooled by my feigned temptation. He has too much riding on a perfect season and has plans to join the NHL after winning the Frozen Four.</p> <p>So he proposes our own bet. If he wins, I stay away from his teammates and stop messing with their heads. If I win, he tells my father—his beloved coach—about his teammates' dirty plans for me.</p> <p>The more Aasher crosses the lines we've carved into the ice, the more I find myself letting him. The only problem is someone else is in on our gamble, and they aren't willing to concede.</p> <p>Ice Bet <i>is a spicy coach's daughter college sports romance. It is a complete stand-alone. The other books in the series do not need to be listened to in order, but you will see glimpses of future characters in each book.</i></p>";
