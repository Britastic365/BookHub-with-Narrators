window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Angelic fact number 100: Having wings doesn’t make one noble; it simply makes one fly.</p> <p>Naya and Adam have nothing in common. Besides black wings. The same birthday. And fathers who are as close as brothers. But nothing else. Sweet, diligent Naya has always abided by the rules. Arrogant, uncivil Adam has made it his life’s mission to break each one. She is the beloved daughter of an archangel. He is the guilds’ resident bad boy...well, bad fletching.</p> <p>When Naya thrusts herself into Adam’s life to request a place on his clandestine team of guardians, he turns her away. The last thing his unsanctioned squad needs is an archangel’s attention, and the last thing he needs is a bubbly, blonde distraction with a sinful voice and soulful eyes. Problem is, Naya suddenly, and inexplicably, becomes the only thing he wants.</p> <p>Fans of steamy enemies to lovers will swoon for this trilogy finale.</p>";
