window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>USA Today</i></b><b> best-selling author Adriana Locke brings laughter and love in this friends-to-lovers small-town romance. </b></p> <p>Love is crazy.</p> <p>Peck Ward, the sweet, small-town mechanic, isn't sure it's for everyone. Least of all him. His life is chaotic enough without adding the pressure of a relationship. Besides, unrequited love is a real thing, and he's kind of over it.</p> <p>This works out perfectly until a certain someone throws a wrench - pun intended - into his plans. As they go from adversaries to friends to possibly something more, things get complicated. After all, they know how this story ends. It's not with them together.</p> <p>His easy grin is enough to win her over. Her unabashed personality does him in. But are they ready to accept the fact that, sometimes, you don't find love where you're looking for it? Sometimes, you find it in the most unexpected, craziest places.</p>";
