window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This Wallflower Queen needs to be praised like the good girl she is...</p> <p>I’m the good twin, the quiet one, the one who hides in the shadows. I never draw attention to myself, never cause my family concern, and most people forget I exist.</p> <p>My sister is my polar opposite in every way. Loud and in the spotlight, she likes to let people believe she’s the bad twin, but I know better.</p> <p>So when I’m mistaken for her, kidnapped and thrust into the spotlight, my three gorgeous rescuers, now bodyguards, are my only protection from the attention I’ve avoided my entire life—and suddenly, I want to be the bad twin.</p> <p>I want THEIR attention.</p> <p>I want THEIR touch.</p> <p>I want THEIR praise.</p> <p>We were hired to rescue and protect the twenty-two year old kidnapped daughter of a billionaire, but none of us expected to fall in love.</p> <p>She’s everything we’ve been looking for and more, but we’re on the job with a timid and traumatized client, and the number one rule as a bodyguard is Don’t lust after the Client. Although left unstated, we’re pretty sure rule number two is Don’t f--k the Client. But the more time we spend together, the harder it is to ignore our feelings, especially as she becomes more dependent upon us, seeking the physical touch she never received growing up.</p> <p>She wants our attention and she’s got it. But it’s more than that. Our good girl has been lonely her whole life—a quelled bird trapped in a gilded cage with no one to take care of her. We are the men to change that. And as soon as the threat on her life is dealt with, that’s what we aim to do.</p> <p>She’s ours to protect, ours to cherish, ours to adore.</p>";
