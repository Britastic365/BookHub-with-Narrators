window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A love triangle made legend... A chance to rewrite the stars.</b></p> <p><i>Lancelot</i></p> <p>I spent my life in service to my king, loyal to my queen, and loved by them both. Until she ruined me.</p> <p>Guinevere made her choice, and it wasn’t me. So, I sought out a way to fight the pain of losing her...of losing them both. Eternally languishing in purgatory was not what I had in mind.</p> <p>But now, hundreds of years later, I’ve been returned to life for a reason. The end times are here, and I’m the one chosen to help stop the apocalypse. I only wish the woman I’m bound to wasn’t the very one I’d tried to forget.</p> <p>My Gwen had a secret she never shared in our past life together. She’s a witch, cursed to live forever, and she’s never forgiven me for what happened between us.</p> <p>I am Lancelot du Lac. I was her champion once, I will be again, and this time, I won’t so willingly share.</p> <p><i>Brooks</i></p> <p>I never wanted to share Gwen, not with anyone, and definitely not with Lancelot. But now that he’s gone and the truth about my past has been revealed, everything is different.</p> <p>I used to be a king. I lived my life shrouded by a lie. Afraid to take the love I desperately wanted - love from my queen as well as my knight. That fear is the reason I lost both of them. This is my second chance to be the man Gwen needs, to take up Excalibur and stop the apocalypse, and to finally accept who I truly am.</p> <p>I am Arthur Pendragon, at least, I was. In our past, I broke both Gwen and Lancelot. But this time, I’ll be the hero they each deserve.</p> <p><b>Also includes bonus material:</b></p> <p>\"On a Cold Winter's Night\" (A Watcher/Siren Coven short story)</p>";
