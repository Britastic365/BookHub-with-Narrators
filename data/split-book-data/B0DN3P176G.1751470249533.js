window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Gia Keats works both sides of love’s dirty business. Some days are spent at Silhouette Bridal Boutique, helping brides prepare for their delusional walk to happily ever after. Other days she clocks hours for Duplicity, spying on cheaters and crushing their plans for future trysts. The two jobs are a solid reminder to ignore the dead thing inside her chest and to stay out of love’s sight. She never expected to get caught. </p> <p>Love is also pretty far down on Mark Foster’s priority list. The closest thing he’s had to a relationship was two nights with a hottie tourist looking for an unforgettable vacation bang. But after he catches a gorgeous local spying on a public make-out session, his sour view of long-term turns a little sweet. He’ll even ignore the odd coincidences that follow her for a taste of the L word. </p> <p>Falling for Mark’s charm would be easier than choosing a single item from a dessert menu, but Gia knows love’s never that simple. When an anonymous Duplicity client hires her to target a Silhouette bride and groom, both sides of the business collide. And Mark’s ties to the bride are the icing on the screwed up cake.</p>";
