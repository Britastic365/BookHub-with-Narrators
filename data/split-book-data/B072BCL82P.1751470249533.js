window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Leonidas: I am a Dragon Prince of the House of Smoke...and I am cursed. Falling in love was never in the cards for me. An angry witch made sure of that - if I lose my heart, I lose my life. Only now, a treaty guaranteeing peace will die with me, unless I convince some hapless human to fall in love with me and bear my child - a dragonling born of magic and a love that's true. But I know nothing of love. Five hundred years of guarding my heart and opening my bed mean I've got zero chance at this. Yet if I fail, it won't just be my death but countless others. </p> <p>Rosalyn: My luck has never been good. Being a witch who can't do magic sucks on most days - it's even worse when your mother's cancer can't be cured. But I'll do whatever it takes to turn our luck around, including stealing magic-healing blood from a shifter. Besides, they owe me - a hot-as-sin shifter seduced my mother, got us thrown out of the coven, and ruined my life. One of them can bleed a little to make things right. And a dragon prince with his wacky mating game and blood 10 times more powerful? The perfect mark. My luck might just be turning good after all. Contains mature themes. </p>";
