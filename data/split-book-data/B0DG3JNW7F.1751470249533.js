window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>I've been abducted by an alien in a cowboy hat.</b></p> <p>He needs me to play the role of fake fiancée to appease his family of tentacle-tailed <i>cops.</i> I'll keep up the charade as long as I need if it means being reunited with Abraxas and Rurik. It shouldn't be too hard, right? To play pretend…</p> <p>My life force is now inextricably tied to handsome, gun-totin' Officer Hyt. But do you know what happens if my new in-laws find out that I'm mated to three different males? Intergalactic war, that's what.</p> <p>Eve Wakefield here, currently stationed on the water planet, Yaoh. I've been subject to all sorts of unimaginable cruelty since landing here: family drama, ill-fitting bathing suits, and Hyt's horrible childhood friend. This woman is not only in love with my (fake) mate, but she's also disturbingly perceptive. If she tells the Chief of Police that his son and I are liars, we're dead. Did I mention that liars are executed here?</p> <p>And what about the king and queen, the ones stuck on that horrible spaceship? Liars might be killed on Hyt's planet, but Rurik's people won't stand for adultery. If they find out, they'll do worse; they'll start eating planets and they won't stop.</p> <p>Ah, hell. I did not intend to be crowned the queen of aliens. It sounds like the dumbest dumb-dumb alien romance plot ever. But if that's the only way to save the people I love, can I do it?</p> <p>Wear the crown, take the throne, save the universe. Yeah, I got this.</p> <p>Venery <i>is book three in the For the Love of Aliens trilogy, a why-choose/reverse harem alien romance. In the series finale, we'll see what it looks like when Eve's three alien males come together, find out what it really means when a spaceship eats something, and see our beloved caterer/queen of the universe get the ending she deserves. Narrated in duet style.</i></p>";
