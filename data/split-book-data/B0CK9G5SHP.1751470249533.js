window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>It began with an interview that should have been mundane, and it ended with me becoming a foster mom and my boss demanding I uncover evidence to put a man behind bars—for life.</i></b></p> <p>I believed I was one of the good ones. Incorruptible. I certainly wasn’t a member of the Dirty Blue like others I knew.</p> <p>Then, I met Drago Acerbi. I soon realized nothing could have prepared me for the consequences of falling in love with the enemy—a dangerous criminal whom I'm supposed to lock up.</p> <p>Yet, I was the one keeping our relationship a secret. Drago knew that. He also knew I had a job to do. What he didn’t know was that the baby I was protecting was his son.</p> <p>At least, he didn’t until my superior discovered our forbidden love affair—and I lost everything. My career. The man I had fallen for. The baby I’d grown to love. A life I didn’t know I wanted.</p> <p>I’d soon learn I wasn’t the only one harboring a secret they wanted to keep hidden from the world. That’s when I found out exactly who Drago Acerbi really was, and it sent a chill down my spine.<br> <br> <b>This book has it all. Scandal. Action-packed suspense and drama. A plot twist that’ll have your jaw dropping. Protective hero vibes. And a kidnapping. It’s detective romance with light mafia/organized crime fiction.</b></p> <p>This novel was previously released as The Dirty Justice<i> </i>trilogy. If you've listened to, <i>Dirty Blue</i>, <i>Dirty War</i>,<i> and Dirty Sin </i>by N. E. Henderson, then you've listened to this book. This version was revised and improved, along with new audio and narrators, but the story is the same.</p>";
