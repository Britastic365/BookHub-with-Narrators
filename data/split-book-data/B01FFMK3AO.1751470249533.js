window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Welcome to Nocturne Falls, the town that celebrates Halloween 365 days a year.</b> </p> <p>The tourists think it's all a show: the vampires, the werewolves, the witches, the occasional gargoyle flying through the sky. But the supernaturals populating the town know better. </p> <p>Living in Nocturne Falls means being yourself. Fangs, fur, and all. </p> <p>Sebastian Ellingham isn't known for being a happy vampire. And when his long estranged wife returns expecting to pick up where they left off, things take a sharp turn toward cranky. Sure he's been protecting her for centuries, but her assumption that he's still available (he is) rankles. </p> <p>His answer is to hire a woman to play his fianc√©e. The lucky victim is Tessa Blythe, sister of one of the town's deputies, librarian in need of a job and, oh yes, reluctant Valkyrie. Playing along with Sebastian is all about the end game: earning the position of Dean of Library Studies at the local private academy. </p> <p>When unexpected sparks fly between them, they agree to mutually deny the attraction. Fate, however, has other plans.... </p>";
