window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It was supposed to be paradise.... </p><p>Ivy MacLeod has the perfect opportunity to test her advanced remote sensing technology: mapping a World War II battle site in the islands of Palau. The project is more than an all-expenses-paid trip to paradise. It's also an opportunity to distance her reputation from her traitorous ex-husband. </p><p>But foreign intelligence agencies will kill to possess her invention, and paradise turns deadly when her ex-husband's vicious allies attack. In desperation, she turns to Air Force pilot Jack Keaton. But is he the bigger threat? Jack might be protecting her as he claims...or he could be a foreign agent. Her compass is skewed by his magnetic pull and further thrown off when she learns her own government has betrayed her. </p><p>Stranded on a tropical island with a man whose motives remain a mystery, Ivy must decide who is the spy, who is the protector, and who is the ultimate villain. She longs to trust the man who rescued her, but she's risking more than her heart. Choose right, and she saves her country's secrets - and her life. Choose wrong - and she risks nothing short of all-out war. </p>";
