window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When I was 15, a single bullet changed my life. I spent the next decade trying to outrun the devastation of my past, building an empire that would shield me from whatever life could throw at me. </p> <p>But all the money in the world couldn’t help me when I found a screaming newborn abandoned on my doorstep. </p> <p>I’d never wanted to be a father. Passing the sludge that ran through my veins down to an innocent child seemed like a tragedy. But there she was - pink cheeks, red hair, and mine. </p> <p>Somehow, against all logic, that little girl became the best thing that ever happened to me. It was impossible to stay lost in the past when I was the only one who could protect her future. </p> <p>Which is exactly why, when her mother came back four years later, I was ready for battle. </p> <p>If only I could stop myself from falling in love with her during the war.</p>";
