window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>This set contains Salvatore, Dominic, and Sergio, Three Dark Mafia Romances. It is the core trilogy of the Benedetti Brothers Mafia World!</i></b></p> <p><b><i>Salvatore: A Dark Mafia Romance<br> </i></b><b> <br> Lucia</b></p> <p>It all started with a contract signed by him, then by me, while our families watched. While my father sat silent, a man defeated, giving his daughter to the Benedetti monsters.</p> <p>I obeyed. I played my part. I signed my name and gave away my life. I became their living, breathing trophy, a constant symbol of their power over us.</p> <p>That was five years ago.<br> Then came the time for him to claim me. For Salvatore Benedetti to own me.<br> <br> I had vowed vengeance. I had learned hate. And yet, nothing could have prepared me for the man who now ruled my life.</p> <p>I expected a monster, one I would destroy. But nothing is ever black or white. No one is either good or evil. For all his darkness, I saw his light. For all his evil, I saw his good. As much as he made me hate him, a passion hotter than the fires of hell burned inside me.</p> <p>I was his, and he was mine.<br> My very own monster.</p> <p><b>Salvatore</b></p> <p>I owned the DeMarco Mafia Princess. She belonged to me now. We had won, and they had lost. And what better way to teach a lesson than to take from them that which is most precious? Most beloved?</p> <p>I was the boy who would be king. Next in line to rule the Benedetti Family. Lucia DeMarco was the spoils of war. Mine to do with as I pleased.</p> <p>It was my duty to break her. To make her life a living hell. My soul was dark, I was hell bound. And there was no way out, not for either of us. Because the Benedetti family never lost, and in our wake, we left destruction. It’s how it had always been. How I believed it would always be.</p> <p>Until Lucia.</p> <p><b><i>Dominic: A Dark Mafia Romance</i></b></p> <p>I’m the last-born son of the Mafia King.<br> The one with nothing to lose.</p> <p>I walked away from my family. Turned my back on everything that should have been mine and became what I was meant to be.</p> <p><i>A monster.</i></p> <p>Until the day I stood over Gia cowering in the corner of that decrepit cabin in the woods. Until I saw the mark they’d put on her.</p> <p>It was then I understood something my father used to say. Keep your friends close, your enemies closer.</p> <p>My enemies had overplayed their hand. <br> It was past time I returned to the family. Past time I collected the debts owed me. And long past time I punished those who betrayed me.</p> <p><b><i>Sergio: A Dark Mafia Romance</i></b></p> <p>I’m the first-born son of the mafia king. The favorite. Destined to rule, I’m a dangerous man, a ruthless one. But in my world, you have to be.</p> <p>Then Natalie stumbles into my life. Wrong place. Wrong time.</p> <p>Twice, fate put her in my path.<br> Twice, fate placed the innocent lamb at the mercy of the monster.</p> <p>I gave her a chance to walk away. Told her it would be better for her if she did. But she didn’t listen. And now it’s too late.</p> <p>Because I’m not good. I never wanted to be. And I won’t let her go anymore.<br> <br> I’m not the hero of this story. When I touch her, it’s with dirty hands.</p> <p>I know my reckoning is coming though. I know I’ll burn for the things I’ve done, the sins I’ve committed. And I don’t deny hell is where I belong, but I want my time first. I want my time with her.</p> <p>She’s mine.<br> Forever.<br> No matter what.</p>";
