An antisocial basta— You get the point.</b></p> <p>I'd say it came with being an overworked doctor, but that wasn't the case. In my own personal purgatory, I'd lost touch with what I was meant to do and who I was.</p> <p>Until I got stuck in a hospital elevator with a beautiful, broken woman. Comforting her through hell reminded me why I'd become a doctor in the first place.</p> <p>I had no clue why, but the hippie goddess consumed my thoughts. I was obsessed. From the first touch, I knew I wasn't going to let her go.</p> <p>And that was before I got my memories back.</p> <p>At the best of times, I was crap at relationships—and we were far from the best of times.</p> <p>Thrust into a war I'd forgotten, I had to find a way to explain that we were targets of the soul-stealing organization that'd cursed me.</p> <p>That magicks, fate, Heaven, and Hell were not just tales.</p> <p>That she was my mate, the literal other half of my soul.</p> <p>Unequivocally mine.</p> <p><i>From </i>USA Today <i>bestselling author Layla Frost.
