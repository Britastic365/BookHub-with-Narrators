window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Even salvation can be delivered through the love of the damned. Beauty can be a curse. Faith can be a cage. Only love can set you free. </p><p>A few long weeks after being reluctantly ripped from the comforting embrace of her sacred prophet's religious commune - the only life she has ever known - a terrified Delilah is thrust into a world enveloped by evil and swimming in sin. Steadfastly devout in her faith, and retaining the deep belief that her soul is innately tarnished as a branded \"Cursed woman of Eve\", Delilah is determined to find her way home to her people in The Order and away from the corrupt and damned outlaw motorcycle club - The Hades Hangmen - who hold her at their secluded compound for her protection - a 'protection' she strongly resents. </p><p>Delilah yearns to return home, convinced that only amongst her own people, and under the holy guidance of the Lord's revealed prophet, can her Satan-spawned soul be truly saved. Conditioned her entire life to believe she is a witch - a life-long temptress, the devil's whore - Delilah increasingly resents her beautiful face, her shapely body, and her sensuous effect on men. But when a man of the motorcycle club - a deeply sinful, yet stunningly beautiful man - is charged with her care, Delilah begins to see that this dangerous and moral-less sinner from the 'outside' may offer her something she did not know could truly exist: unconditional love. </p><p>Kyler \"Ky\" Willis loves his life: a daily abundance of brotherhood, liquor, the freedom of the open road, and - best of all - his pick of hot women. Raised a biker brat and now VP of the most notorious MC in the States, Ky has no shortage of club sluts warming his bed; a situation he takes full advantage of until a certain blonde enters his life. A gorgeous pilgrim-blonde he can't get out of his head, a pilgrim-blonde he and his club recently rescued from some backward religious cult, and a pilgrim-blonde he's been ordered to keep the hell away from and his whorish hands off. </p><p>When yet another in a lengthy line of drunken blunders forces Ky to reluctantly take charge of the pilgrim-blonde's care, he realizes that there could be more to this woman than just supermodel looks and a stacked set of tits. He begins to see that she could be the woman who could do the impossible - tame his wild ways and capture his reluctant heart. But the unyielding bonds of Lilah's past are strong, her \"people\" determined and, with a new Prophet in charge and hell bent on revenge, they are mightily reluctant to let her go. </p>";
