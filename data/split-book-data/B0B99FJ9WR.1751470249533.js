window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Passion, duty, and fate collide in this enthralling paranormal shifter romance series by </b><b><i>USA TODAY</i></b><b> best-selling author Krista Street.</b></p> <p><b>Avery</b></p> <p>You'd think a half-witch, quarter-werewolf would be a magical powerhouse, right? Wrong. I'm so nothing special. I'm on the express track to a low-magic ambassador job, right after I complete three months of mandatory Supernatural Forces training.</p> <p>I never expected my biggest stumbling block to be my new squad commander, Wyatt Jamison. He's everything I'm not—a pureblooded werewolf rippling with magic.</p> <p>Did I mention he's also my former teenage crush who still makes my mouth water?</p> <p><b>Wyatt</b></p> <p>Three months. I just have to get through three months of resisting Avery's enticing lilac-and-rainwater scent. Then she'll be shipped off to Geneva and I can get to work forgetting her inquisitive eyes, infectious laugh, and tantalizing curves. It almost kills me to keep her at arm's length, but duty demands it.</p> <p>All of that changes, though, when a rare celestial event erupts strange, new power from Avery—a power that's determined to destroy her. Tasked with unlocking its secrets, I have no choice but to keep her close as I struggle to find her new magic's origins.</p> <p>Because if I don't? Avery's dreams and future will be lost before they've begun.</p>";
