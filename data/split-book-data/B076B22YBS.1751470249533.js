window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From <i>New York Times, USA Today</i>, and <i>Publishers Weekly</i> best-selling author Katie MacAlister comes a mystery with a paranormal twist. </p> <p>There are other worlds with mysteries to solve. </p> <p>Worlds where not all of the suspects are technically alive. That's when Karma kicks in. </p> <p>For all those transmortis anomalies that need to be exterminated, there's Karma Marx - a woman who exorcises haunted houses, sending troublesome spirits and entities to the ever after. What she'd really like is to banish Spider, her cheating, sleazy realtor husband, from her life. So, she makes him a deal: she'll clean one last home for him if he grants her a divorce. </p> <p>The only problem is that Adam, the house's former owner, isn't happy with Karma's plan. Using his poltergeist powers, he seals the place, forcing Karma, Spider, and a motley assortment of characters (living and not-so-living) together for a hair-raising 12 hours. But when Spider turns up dead in the basement, it's a locked house mystery, and Karma's determined to reveal the truth, even if it means tackling all of the mansion's inhabitants - mortal and otherwise.... </p>";
