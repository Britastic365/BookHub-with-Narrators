window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The labyrinth is a death sentence. And I’m trapped inside with a monster.<br> <br> I’m being imprisoned for a crime I didn’t commit. My sentence is brief—only three months—but it doesn’t matter. No one gets out of the labyrinth alive.<br> <br> The underground prison is home to the minotaur, a bull-shifter so feral and violent, he has never been allowed to walk the streets of our city.<br> <br> Or so the legend goes. Nobody who’s seen him has ever lived to tell the tale.<br> <br> When I’m dragged to the labyrinth to carry out my sentence, the skeletons littering the ground tell me all I need to know. The minotaur is a killer and a monster.<br> <br> But this monster doesn’t want to just kill me. What he has planned is much worse.<br> <br> He wants to toy with me—to chase and stalk me.<br> <br> Until I’m his.<br> <br> This story is a re-imagining of the classical Greek myth of the minotaur. In this version, there are no heroes, and the monster gets the girl. All explicit scenes are consensual, and a happily ever after is guaranteed.</p>";
