The one who seems so well put together on the outside but won’t let anyone within an inch of discovering what’s inside. Without a doubt, Zafirah is a daddy’s girl and in her eyes has the perfect role model as a father, which makes it hard for any man to compare. Is her heart even capable of allowing another being to direct her steps? Does she even want to be handled? Her passion for designing clothes and opening a boutique is all she’s worried about until her heart takes a turn when she realizes the chemistry that she and Troy share.</p> <p>Mr. Champion, Zafirah’s father, regards Troy as his son. Will the close-knit relationship they share be a stumbling block for Troy and Zafirah? Is Troy what Mr. Champion envisions for his daughter?
