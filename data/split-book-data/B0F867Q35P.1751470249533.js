window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>With the way things are going, alien abduction doesn't sound all that terrible.</b></p> <p><b>Hugo</b></p> <p>I'm not saying I've thoroughly enjoyed the three years I've spent in captivity on a pleasure planet, shaking my money-maker for intergalactic patrons… but, I mean, it hasn't been all bad. The jelly donuts were a perk. Granted, I didn't really know what I was signing up for when I agreed to be purchased by the sexy pink shark-man, but things seem to be looking up. Even though we don't speak each other's languages, he seems pretty nice—if his sharp-toothed smiles and gentle touches are anything to go by. If only I could get my hands on a translator device so I could ask him what exactly his intentions are. I truly hope I'm not just a pet!</p> <p><b>Roark</b></p> <p>The moment I set eyes on my fluffy-haired, spotted, little huu-man, sitting so sad in his glass prison, I knew I needed to free him, to make him mine. To rid him of this godawful planet and show him a life outside of gilded cages. But as captain of a space voyager, my missions are dangerous and it will be difficult to keep my small mate safe. He's so full of life and excitement and curiosity, but he's also fragile and soft. He must be protected at all costs. And no matter how badly my hearts ache to claim him, I worry that maybe a life with me would just be a different sort of prison.</p> <p>I'm Not Your Pet! <i>is part of the Extra! Extraterrestrial shared world series with Eryn Hawk, where each book focuses on its own pair and their HEA. While these stories can act as standalones, it is best to listen to each author's books in the order of their publication due to world-building.</i></p> <p>I'm Not Your Pet! <i>is a standalone sci-fi alien MM romance with high heat, an HEA, and no cliffhanger. Includes a blossoming romance between a pink alien named Roark and the clever human he rescues. Together, these two are hilarious, adorable, and tooth-achingly sweet. If you like funny stories with language barriers, opposites attract, an age gap, aliens with interesting anatomy, graphic steam, and the slowest, sweetest of all burns, then listen on!</i></p> <p><i>Contains mature content. A complete list of content warnings can be found on the author's website.</i></p>";
