window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Vampire Academy</i> meets <i>X-Men</i> in this completed new adult series! There’s only one rule in the world I come from. Keep our existence a secret. Period.</p> <p>The day my sister broke that rule one too many times, I knew there would be consequences. I expected us to be sent to one of those schools for “troubled” kids - and maybe Daizlei Academy was, in a way. But really, it was far more complicated than that.</p> <p>You see, I thought that world had forgotten me. Forgotten us. For years we were left alone, and one day...we weren’t.</p> <p>It was only when I got there that I remembered the second rule: Trust no one.</p> <p>Because in our world? They would kill me if they knew the truth of what I am.</p> <p>Daizlei Academy is a school for Supernaturals.</p> <p>And me? I’m so much more.</p> <p>This is a New Adult Academy series with slow-burn romance and a strong, but flawed heroine. It is labeled new adult for stronger language and some mature situations. As the heroine ages and grows, so does the content of the stories.</p> <p>This boxset contains:<br> </p> <p></p> <ol> <li><i>Heir of Shadows</i></li> <li><i>Scion of Midnight</i></li> <li><i>Queen of Lies</i></li> <li><i>Vessel of Destruction</i><br> 4. <i>Vessel of Destruction</i></li> </ol>";
