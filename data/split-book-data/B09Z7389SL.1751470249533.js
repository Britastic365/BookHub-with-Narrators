The biggest threat to his future lies dormant in his brain—a psychic monster that wants only to <i>feed</i>. And now, the brutal leash he's kept on that monster is slipping. He prepared for this day, for the end of Ivan Mercant . . . but that was before he met Lei.</p> <p>As primal as she is human, this wild changeling brings color into his life. Then the dream shatters in a rain of blood. Lei is gone. Vanished without a trace . . . until he meets strangely familiar eyes across a busy San Francisco street.</p> <p>Soleil Bijoux Garcia is a healer who has lost everything. She exists in a world of desolate aloneness . . . till the day she finds herself face-to-face with a lethal stranger.

To kill the alpha of the DarkRiver leopard pack.</p> <p>But fate has other plans. Soon, a deadly soldier who believes himself a monster and a broken healer might be all that stand between life and death for the entire Psy race . . . .</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
