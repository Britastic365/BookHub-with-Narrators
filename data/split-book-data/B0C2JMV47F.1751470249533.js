window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"Could you love me?\" he whispered. The question stole my breath and burned my lungs in the silence that followed.</p> <p>I wanted to answer, to whisper yes into the space between us, but I was afraid.</p> <p>All Gesela's life, her home village of Elk has been cursed. And it isn't a single curse—it is one after another, each to be broken by a villager, each with devastating consequences. When Elk's well goes dry, it is Gesela's turn to save her town by killing the toad that lives at the bottom. Except . . . the toad is not a toad at all. He is an Elven prince under a curse of his own, and upon his death, his brothers come for Gesela, seeking retribution.</p> <p>As punishment, the princes banish Gesela to live with their seventh brother, the one they call the beast. Gesela expects to be the prisoner of a hideous monster, but the beast turns out to be exquisitely beautiful, and rather than lock her in a cell, he offers Gesela a deal. If she can guess his true name in seven days, she can go free.</p> <p>Gesela agrees, but there is a hidden catch—she must speak his name with love in order to free him, too.</p> <p>But can either of them learn to love in time?</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
