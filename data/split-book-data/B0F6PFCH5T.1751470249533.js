It is best enjoyed after listening to Bonded by Thorns.</i><br> <br> Farron, the Prince of Autumn, wants nothing less than to be tangled up with Dayton, the Prince of Summer. Dayton is reckless, wild, and probably hasn’t opened a book once in his life. Meanwhile, Farron likes to think everything through—including how to survive the next few weeks while his family is staying in the Summer Realm.<br> <br> But Dayton has set his sights on Farron, and despite his better judgment, Farron finds himself drawn into the storm that is the Summer Prince. The deeper he falls, the more Dayton pulls away, and Farron can’t hold onto him any more than the sand can hold onto the tide.<br> <br> Amid the dangerous landscape of gladiator battles, political intrigue, and the scorching heat of a Summer sky, Farron and Dayton are set on a path that will lead to true love or eternal heartbreak.<br> <br> A love story years in the making before a certain Rose blooms in the hearts of two men destined to save the Enchanted Vale… or destroy it.<br> <br> <i>PRINCE OF THE ARENA is a sweet-and-spicy prequel novella featuring MM content. It is best enjoyed after listening to BONDED BY THORNS, the first book in the BEASTS OF THE BRIAR series, a steamy adult Beauty and the Beast retelling set in a fantasy fae realm, where the beautiful bookworm doesn’t have to choose between four fae princes.</i></p>";
