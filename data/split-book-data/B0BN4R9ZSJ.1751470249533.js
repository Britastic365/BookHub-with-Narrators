window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>How do you screw up your life in three steps? Easy.</b></p> <p>Step one: Graduate from college with no prospective jobs lined up.</p> <p>Step two: Move back home with your parents because no job unfortunately equals no money.</p> <p>Step 3: Forget to social media stalk the guy who broke your heart before accepting a job in a town with a smaller population than a frat party on a Wednesday night.</p> <p>I should quit but living with my parents forever doesn't seem like a solid life plan.</p> <p>Jase Hale is the golden boy. Our boss thinks he's beyond talented. The receptionist sends him more flirty smiles and baked goods than is considered normal for a woman old enough to be his mom.</p> <p>I try to avoid him and his undeniable charm at all costs.</p> <p>He does everything he can to get under my skin. Every encounter leaves me reeling. Every smirk makes my stomach flip. I assume he's playing with me, just pushing my buttons like always, but when he lifts me onto my desk and shuts me up with his lips on mine, I'm more confused than ever. It doesn't matter that he's trying to prove me wrong. Having my heart broken by the same jerk twice in one lifetime isn't an option. He already blew his shot, and I have no intention of getting in Trouble with the Hotshot Boss.</p> <p>Previously published as <i>Double Shot</i> by Holly Renee.</p>";
