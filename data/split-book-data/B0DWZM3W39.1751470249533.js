In an unexpected turn of events, my own mates turned against me and handed me over to the new Alpha Supreme, leaving me no choice but to face a trial that will determine my fate in light of the crimes I have been accused of.

If Severi gets me… my Nexus will be the last thing Starlight City sees before it is gone.</p> <p>Celestial Alphas <i>is a dark romantasy with men who growl more than speak.
