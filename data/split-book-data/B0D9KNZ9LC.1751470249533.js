window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Larkin</b></p> <p>Look, here's the thing.</p> <p>I'm young, carefree, and my job as the assistant to Holt, manager and owner of the Goliaths of Wrestling, means I'm surrounded by half-naked beefcake wrestlers all day. Of course, I'm going to be interested in… getting to know them all better. It would be, like, illegal for me not to lust after them all, right?</p> <p>There's just one hurdle I have to get over first before I can… get to know the wrestlers in the way I want. And that hurdle makes me really, really freaking nervous.</p> <p>So I come up with an amazing idea. Holt's bodyguard Seb, a werewolf, is the quiet, dependable, calm presence in the office. He's safe. He's not as intimidating as the wrestlers, and we're kind of buddies, so I decided to ask him for help with my little… predicament.</p> <p>Just for some practice. Before I move on to the big leagues. That's all it is. Practice.</p> <p><b>Seb</b></p> <p>I'm the foolish old wolf who's pined after Larkin since the moment he started working here. I've had to watch him flirt with all the wrestlers, listen to him talk about how much he wants them, and act like I didn't care, and it's never gotten easier.</p> <p>At least no one knows. I can never tell him. He's too young for me, too carefree and irresponsible, and he's never shown even a hint of being interested in me that way. Mentally, I've accepted it. My heart, however, is a different matter.</p> <p>Then he comes to me with a ridiculous proposition. Something I never thought I'd get to experience, something I should absolutely turn down, but I can't. I'm not strong enough to deny myself. And I want to help Larkin in any way I can.</p> <p>It's just practice for him. I have to keep reminding myself of that, every time I get to touch him—every time he's pressed against me, every time he falls asleep on my chest. He doesn't want me. He just wants… lessons. Practice.</p> <p>That's all it is. Practice.</p>";
