Hell-bent on exposing the atrocities, I reach out to a rebel group to feed them information.<br> <br> Too quickly, the jig is up. I manage one last message to my rebel contact, Zach, before I’m locked in the mad councilman’s basement.<br> <br> When Trask arrives, he claims to be my contact. <b>He’s huge and horned with wings that darken the sky.</b> I know he’s lying because Zach is human, but when the monster steals me into the air, I hold on for dear life.<br> <br> <b>TRSAK</b><br> Kat has risked everything and played a critical role in keeping everyone in our stronghold safe. So when I receive her desperate message, I embark on a rescue mission. I refuse to leave anyone—Kadrixan or human—behind. Especially her.<br> <br> I venture into the heart of enemy territory to find the little human. But when I finally have her in my arms and tell her I am Zach, my little Kat doesn’t believe me!<br> <br> I am a patient warrior, though. Once we’re safe, <b>I have forever to convince Kat she is mine.</b> But first, I need to get us out of here.<br> <br> <b>A Monster’s Fate is a sci-fi alien romance with a growly hero, lots of action, and an HEA, guaranteed.
