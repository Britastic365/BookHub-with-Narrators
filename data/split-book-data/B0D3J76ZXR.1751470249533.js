window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>From Wall Street Journal and Amazon Charts bestselling author Brittney Sahin, comes a sizzling love story between a morally gray hero who doesn’t believe in second chances, and the woman who will make him question everything.</i></b><br> <br> Five years ago, a phone call forever changed my life as I listened to my wife being murdered half a world away.<br> <br> Going rogue from the CIA, I became a man feared by everyone as I sought vengeance. Lies she’d told and secrets she’d kept, pushed me over an even darker edge.<br> <br> With nothing to lose, I became unstoppable. A devil among men. Until justice was served, or so I’d thought it’d been . . .<br> <br> Working alongside a team of veterans, trying to find my way back to the man I’d once been, another life-altering call came, drawing me back to the dark world I’d left behind.<br> <br> The assignment should’ve been straightforward. Rescue a brilliant scientist working on a classified government project and save the nation from an attack while I was at it. But nothing in my life was ever simple.<br> <br> When the missing scientist turned out to be the same off-limits woman I’d been obsessing over for months, saving her life was the easy part.<br> <br> Not corrupting her in the process was the challenge. Especially when that gorgeous woman, innocent and untainted by the evils of the world, begged me to do exactly that.<br> <br> Our past was complicated. The chemistry between us, undeniable. The desire to claim her as my own and never let go, unbearable. <br> <br> My team may have been up against our most formidable threat ever, but there I was about to do something I never did. Lose my control.<br> <br> <i>Author’s Note: This is Carter Dominick’s book in the Falcon Falls Security Series. This romantic suspense novel may be listened to as a standalone.</i></p>";
