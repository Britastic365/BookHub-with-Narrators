window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>To the unassuming observer, Ben Lockwood is your typical suburban dad.</b></p> <p>Aside from the fact that he's only thirty-six and his daughter is a sophomore in college. He and his wife, Jessica, had their only daughter, Hailey, when they were in high school. So you can imagine the unease Ben is feeling when said daughter brings her new boyfriend home for Thanksgiving… To stay in their house for the whole weekend.</p> <p>Ryan Harper, otherwise known as the boyfriend, is every dread Ben's ever had in his daughter dating come to fruition. There's nothing wrong with Ryan. He's polite, smart, and charming… He doesn't have any neck tattoos or facial piercings, and he drives a BMW. But still, he's dating Ben's daughter. That makes him a threat.</p> <p>It's in Ben's best interest to keep an eye on the kid. You know, to make sure there's no funny business going on under his roof. Unfortunately for him, the tension in the house is less about Ryan being his daughter's boyfriend and more about him being a strangely intriguing human.</p> <p>Soon enough, Ben can't tell if he's watching Ryan to protect his daughter's innocence or obliterate his own. It seems like the boring married guy image isn't going to hold up for long… Not after this bizarre, life-changing weekend.</p> <p>What are these new, strange feelings and desires? Where did they come from? And why do they have to center around what belongs to his daughter?</p> <p>Ben and Ryan's situation couldn't get much more complicated… Until Jessica steps into the mix.</p> <p>An unexpected push is all it took for their lives to change forever.</p> <p><i>MM turns to MMF in a very steamy, unexpected romance that will make you laugh, maybe cry, and definitely swoon. If you're looking for an open-minded tale of taboo and forbidden romance that ultimately works out for its characters, this book is for you!</i></p> <p><i>Contains mature content.
