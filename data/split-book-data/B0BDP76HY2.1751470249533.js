window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Twelve years on the prison planet Erebus makes a man long for death. The worst part for Tannin Everette is that he was framed for murder. He's innocent. When the ship Imojenna lands for emergency repairs, Tannin risks everything to escape . . . only to find himself face to face with the captain's undeniably gorgeous sister.</p> <p>Zahli Sherron isn't planning on turning Tannin in. In fact, she actually believes him. Sure, he's sexy as every kind of sin, but he's no criminal—so she hides him. But no one escapes from Erebus and lives to tell about it. With every day that passes, Zahli further risks the lives of the entire crew . . . even as she falls in love with a man she can never have for herself.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
