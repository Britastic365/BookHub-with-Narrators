window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Rule them. Win. Become Grand High.</b></p> <p>My name is Hector Briar, and I live for revenge. It's been eighteen years since Witch Hunters murdered my parents, and still, the night haunts me. A part of me died that night when six-year-old me was forced to listen to their brutal murder. Since then, I've gone from prey to predator. I spend my nights stalking Oxford's streets for those who'd see me slaughtered for being what I am. A witch. And more than that, the son of the last Grand High.</p> <p>I've spent the last years hidden in the shadows, not only from Witch Hunters but also from my own kind. But one fateful night lands me directly in the hands of the people I've been evading my entire life—the Coven. Whereas the Witch Hunters want to destroy me, the Coven wants me for a darker fate. For my blood. It's the key to starting the Witch Trials, a contest to find the next Grand High, a contest where witches battle to the death—or madness.</p> <p>Thrown into the middle of the very contest my mother died trying to prevent, I must make allies with my enemies if I wish to survive the first night. Not so bad when my ally so happens to be an attractive blue-eyed, six-foot-something, tattooed from neck to navel, bloodthirsty rival: Arwyn Morgan.</p> <p>I soon discover that not is all as it seems. Dark forces are lingering in the shadows, and the truth is a hard pill to swallow. The Witch Hunters seek a Champion of their own. Enemies and allies lose all meaning when a wolf invades the flock.</p> <p>Surviving the Witch Trials quickly becomes the least of my worries when ancient forces reveal their true natures. Something dark stirs within me, waiting for its inevitable freedom. I'm the key to keeping it locked away—or freeing it.</p> <p>The Witch and His Crow <i>is the first book in an MM paranormal romance series of witchcraft and bloodthirsty enemies, perfect for fans of </i>The Serpent and the Wings of Night <i>and </i>Her Soul to Take.</p>";
