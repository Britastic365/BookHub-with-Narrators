window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Fake dating the hot grump next door until Halloween is more of a trick than a treat.</b></p> <p>I only pretend to be the town psychic—which means my crystal ball never told me I'd be moving in with my elderly aunt and dealing with her hot, grumpy neighbor. Sure, she's hilarious, and she's letting me stay in her tiny guest house in return for dealing with her \"ghost problem.\" The catch? I don't really believe in the supernatural. Even worse, Ward Carlisle, her hunky neighbor, is a real pain in my pumpkin patch. The fact our families have been feuding over some land for centuries doesn't help, either.</p> <p>When Ward shows up at my fortune-telling booth at the town fall festival desperate for my help, he promises he'll give my aunt the land she wants if I can fake a relationship with him until Halloween—and convince his ex-girlfriend we're in love. I'm always down for a little mayhem, and if it means getting one up on prickly Ward, I'm totally game.</p> <p>But bizarre occurrences keep pushing Ward and I together: spooky calls for help, which have me running to him in the night, phantom cold spots that push us together for warmth, and visions of people who aren't really there that scare me right into his arms. Even stranger, though, is all this time we're spending together means I'm getting to see the real him…and I like it. Things between us start heating up just as the weather turns cold.</p> <p>I'm not sure which is more unbelievable: that Ward and I could have something real, or that my aunt might be right about her ghost problem.</p>";
