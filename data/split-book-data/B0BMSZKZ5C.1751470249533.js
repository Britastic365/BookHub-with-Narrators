It’s a stand-alone mafia arranged marriage romance, complete with a happily ever after and no cliffhangers. A dark romance with adult themes, Silent Vows may not be suitable for sensitive audiences.</i></p> <p>A Note from the Author: While Noemi may be a silent virgin bride, don't expect meekness. She is bold, fiercely loyal, and one of the few people unafraid of Conner Byrne. These two are electric, and I ADORE them! For those of you who are new to me, I write what I'd call \"mafia lite.\" My heroes are hardened criminals with soft spots for their heroines. There may be violence and cruelty in my books, but never between the main characters. Enjoy!</p>";
