window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Welcome to Nocturne Falls, the town that celebrates Halloween 365 days a year. </p> <p>The tourists think it's all a show: the vampires, the werewolves, the witches, the occasional gargoyle flying through the sky. But the supernaturals populating the town know better. </p> <p>Living in Nocturne Falls means being yourself. Fangs, fur, and all. </p> <p>Las Vegas headliner and vampire Desdemona Valentine is one cool, collected diva on the outside. On the inside she's petrified of falling in love after her last relationship nearly killed her...literally. Protecting her wounded heart makes for a lonely life, but she has her fame and fortune to keep her company. Who needs anything more? </p> <p>Julian Ellingham does. One look at Desdemona onstage, and the vampire is smitten. She initially ignores him, but his relentless pursuit pays off when a wild night ends in a Vegas wedding. Finally Julian has everything he wants while all Desdemona wants is...a divorce. </p> <p>Julian sweet-talks Desdemona into letting him prove his love, but his time is running out. Especially after someone repeatedly tries to turn his bride to ash. When Desdemona flees Vegas for the spooky streets of Nocturne Falls and Julian's protection, he's more than willing to help out. But can he convince Desdemona to trust him, or will \"death do us part\" become a reality? </p>";
