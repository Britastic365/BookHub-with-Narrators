For seven months, I've been gone, only to come back to be tested in every way possible. They say keep your enemies close, and my demons welcomed me back with open arms. My downfall is a necessary evil. But Mia is my endgame. </p> <p><b>Mia: </b>Seven months ago, Ollie surrendered to the darkness, abandoning me in the process. He stripped me of my walls, only to leave me defenseless. Now he's back, along with fresh new faces and obstacles standing in our way. He says to trust no one. Not even him. How am I supposed to be strong for us both when I'm losing my grip?</p>";
