window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>A former model, a grumpy lawyer, and a single dad walk into an audition for a children's musical.... They’re all Miles Brodie. It’s only cute if you aren’t the director who’s being bribed to cast his daughter. </i></p> <p><b>Dear Mr. Cross,</b></p> <p>Re: our discussion</p> <ol> <li>True. Casting my daughter as the lead in your musical could be considered bribery if people find out I’m investing in it, but no one needs to know.</li> <li>I only want to hire you as Macy’s singing coach so her vocal skills will improve.</li> <li>Maybe if you’d spent less time surfing and more on your singing career, you wouldn’t be in this financial predicament.</li> <li>Re: your living situation—my neighbor has a guest house. If you cast Macy as Alice, I will pay for your first three months’ rent.</li> </ol> <p>Do we have a deal?</p> <p>Best regards,</p> <p>Miles Brodie </p> <p><b>Dear Mr. Brodie,</b></p> <ol> <li>It absolutely <i>is</i> bribery, but I absolutely need that money for my production. Thanks!</li> <li>It is very cute that you will do anything to get Macy this part, but I would only coach that sweet child as a favor to all mammals with functional hearing.</li> <li>If I spend less time surfing, will you spend less time jogging on my beach with your shirt off?</li> <li>You want to pay me to live next door so you don’t have to drive anywhere to frown at me?</li> <li>I have another condition for casting Macy as Alice—you have to perform the part of the Cheshire Cat.</li> </ol> <p>Purrrrrrr,</p> <p>Aria</p> <p>This is a stand-alone multicast duet audiobook in the Brodie Brothers series. Narrated by Jason Clarke and Mackenzie Cartwright. Featuring Teddy Hamilton, Zachary Webber, Emma Wilder, Emily Woo Zeller, and Connor Crais.</p>";
