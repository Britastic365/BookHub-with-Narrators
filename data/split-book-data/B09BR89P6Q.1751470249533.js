Until the eve of my 18th birthday.</p> <p>That was the night he returned to claim me. </p> <p><b>Damian</b></p> <p><i>Circumstance put Cristina on my path.</i></p> <p><i>Fate bound her to me.</i></p> <p>Cristina and I share a common past. A single night that changed the course of our lives.</p> <p>She asked me if I was a monster the night I met her. </p> <p>I am. </p> <p>She’s about to learn I’m her monster.</p> <p>Because, the countdown that began eight years ago has ended. Her time is up. </p> <p>On the stroke of midnight, she’s mine. </p> <p><b><i>Unholy Intent</i></b></p> <p><b>Cristina</b></p> <p><i>In this house of lies and liars, behind every locked door is a monster in wait.</i></p> <p>Forced to marry a man I hate, I’m now bound to Damian. There’s something between us that needs to be played out. I don’t know what it is. I don’t know that he does. But we’re locked together for some strange, grim purpose.</p> <p>Will we survive it?</p> <p>He may, since he’s the one pulling the strings.</p> <p>But will I?</p> <p><b>Damian</b></p> <p><i>My brother will tell you that I usurped his throne and maybe I did, but it had to be done.</i></p> <p>I built our family up from the ashes. I put us back at the top of the food chain. And marrying Cristina was as much to cement my place as it was to keep her safe.</p> <p>She doesn’t believe that last part yet, but I see how she clings to me in the darkness. And the lock on her door is as much to keep the monsters out as it is to keep her in.</p> <p>I told her one lie, though. I made her a promise I’m not sure I ever meant to keep. I told her I’d let her go once I had what I wanted.</p> <p>But in a world of monsters, I need her like man needs air. And I have no intention of letting her go.</p>";
