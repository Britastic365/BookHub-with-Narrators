window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A vampire who's lost everything he cared about searches for solace in all the wrong places.</b></p> <p>Zacharias, a former flight trainer in Gabriel's Legion, was accused and convicted of an abominable crime, then banished to Earth. Now a vampire in the Santa Cruz nest, he struggles to find the confidence he lost, hiding his pain in all the worst ways.</p> <p>But a wolf is in town. A wolf unlike any Zach has met before. His smiles are unsettling, his scent soothing, his voice an achingly sweet song that touches Zach's spirit. The alpha male speaks with few words, but always with truth. Ryder makes Zach want to believe again, but hope is a soul strangler and can't be trusted.</p> <p><b>A wolf betrayed by his alpha and his own cowardice can sometimes find redemption. </b></p> <p>Ryder believes he failed his original pack. He followed the orders of a sadistic alpha, going against his nature and turning his back on weaker pack members even though they desperately needed his help. He could have stepped up, challenged the prime alpha and taken charge. Saved lives. <br> <br> But the fates have given him another chance. Ryder is now the second-in-command under an alpha he greatly respects. He'll work to heal the harm he's responsible for and will remain loyal to his Prime until the end of his days. Only someone may need him even more.<br> <br> Ryder knows the beautiful male with the face of an angel, the grace of a Fresian stallion, and the feisty nature of an alley cat is hurting. He thinks he can hide his pain from Ryder and his wolf, but they know better. In a fit of anger, Zach has issued a challenge and expects a response, but a wolf is patient and knows how to bide his time. Zach may be a vampire, but Ryder wants the first bite.</p>";
