window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>He's a monster with sharp teeth, but I'm the snake he won't see coming....</p> <p>Tormented. Lethal. Dead inside.There is only one reason Miguel became the bodyguard of a cartel boss’ son. So that one day, he can take revenge and put a bullet between his father’s eyes. To do that, he needs to keep his secrets close and play a double game with the outrageous Nero Moreno.</p> <p>And there has never been a more infuriating demon of a man than Nero. From his filed teeth and green hair to the gaudy gold necklaces and a diamond-studded AK-47, he is narco excess personified, and everything Miguel despises. The fact that Nero hits on Miguel every chance he gets is just another burden, because Miguel decided long ago that there is no room for love in his black heart.</p> <p>Slutty. Deadly. Lives to spite the world. No one refuses Nero Moreno. When he sets his sights on a man, sooner or later, his mark surrenders. With the endless buffet of flesh available to him, he shouldn’t care about rejection, but every time his insanely hot bodyguard gives him the cold shoulder, Nero is more set on seduction. He can see a spark of interest behind the dead black eyes. What does Miguel hide under his tattooed skin and expressionless face? Why won’t he let Nero touch him? Is his heart really made of stone, or does it hold a soul gentler than Miguel would like to admit? Nero will not rest until he finds out.</p> <p>When their goals collide, blood follows bullets, and it turns out nothing is as it seems.</p> <p>Gritty, dark, and intense, <i>Love Among Reptiles</i> is a dark enemies-to-lovers M/M romance standalone novel set in the world of cartels.
