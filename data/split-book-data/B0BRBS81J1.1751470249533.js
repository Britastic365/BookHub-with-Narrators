Students were going missing or turning up dead on campus and rumors circulated about humans infiltrating academy grounds.</p> <p>Seeds of fear bloomed within the student body. To make matters worse, the mate that rejected me was hellbent on painting a bright red target on my back with the help of his new girlfriend.</p> <p>Against all odds, I found refuge with seven irresistible supernatural men, each one more different from the last.</p> <p>Would the bond of my mates be enough to manifest my hidden power? Without it, I was vulnerable. And with a dragon cult attempting to wage war on humans, I had no choice but to fight.</p> <p><i>Fate Hollow Academy: Term 1</i> is book one in the Fate Hollow Academy Series. It is a paranormal why-choose romance with all characters over the age of twenty-one. It contains mature subject matter that may not be suitable for all listeners.</p>";
