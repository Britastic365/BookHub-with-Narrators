window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"The perfect blend of soul-crushing angst, laugh out loud wit, and heart-melting romance.” (Helena Hunting, <i>New York Times</i> and <i>USA Today</i> best-selling author)</p> <p>From number one Amazon best seller L.J. Shen comes a new, star-crossed lovers romance about loss, love, and meeting The One when you are too young to know how to keep them. </p> <p>Sometimes you meet people who are out of this world, so you make them a part of yours. </p> <p>A one-night stand born from vengeance in a foreign land. <br> An explosive chemistry neither of us could deny. <br> We signed a contract on the back of a Boar’s Head Pub napkin that said if we ever met again, we would drop everything and be together. <br> Eight years and thousands of miles later, he’s here. <br> In New York. <br> And he’s America’s music obsession. <br> The intangible Irish poet who brings record executives to their knees. <br> The blizzard in my perfect, unshaken snow globe. <br> Last time we spoke, he was a beggar with no intention of becoming a king. <br> But a king he became, and now I’m his servant. <br> I’m not the same broken princess Malachy Doherty put back together with his callused hands. <br> I have a career I love. <br> A boyfriend I adore. <br> An apartment, a roommate, a life. <br> I changed. He changed, too. <br> But Mal kept the napkin. <br> Question is, will I keep my word?</p>";
