That’s how I ended up in Boston. Here, I, Ivy McAlister, have everything I need: a caring boyfriend, Mike, who wants me to move in with him; a spot in the Harvard MBA program that I have worked hard to secure; and life away from Manhattan, where I can sleep without being tormented by my nightmares. My needs are met, but my wants are not…<br> <b>The problem? The man of my dreams and my boyfriend are two different people.</b><br> Nick was unattainable then, and he is unavailable now. Nevertheless, he is a force of nature, the very essence of my life, the guiding star of my universe, and the eternal object of my desires. He has the power to make me whole again or break me into pieces. I ran away from him the day I was going to confess my feelings to him. He let me go and never came after me…until now.</p>";
