Some have darkness thrust upon them. Me? I was the darkness.</p> <p>Forged in the flames of my stepfather’s hatred, I learned from an early age that life was cruel, harsh, and unforgiving. This life would destroy you unless you stood up for yourself, took control, and fought back.</p> <p>I was always a fighter, but my soul remained charred from the fires that consumed me. My heart is an empty cavern filled with echoes of a life I’d never live.

People avoided me. They feared me. But not her.</p> <p>From the shadows, she watched. In the darkness, she waited. In her dreams, she saw something no one else did. She saw the real me.</p> <p>But dreams aren’t meant for monsters like me. And when a devil from my past comes back to haunt me, I have to make a decision for this life and the next. I need to keep her safe at all costs. My little raven. Death waits for no man. But neither does <b>The Reaper</b>.</p> <p><i>The Reaper </i>is a standalone new-adult romance.
