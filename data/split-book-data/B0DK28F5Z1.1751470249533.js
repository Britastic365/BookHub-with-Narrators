window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When you dance with Death, you have to be willing to roll the bones . . .</p> <p>Raven Bonetalker, the Daughter of Bones, has her plate full. Not only is her neighbor still driving her nuts, but she's in a new relationship with Kipa, the Lord of the Wolves, and neither one is ready for everything that entails. But life takes a sinister turn when a spirit begins siphoning off the life force of one of Kipa's wolf shifters.</p> <p>Gunnar, a member of the SuVahta-the pack of divine wolf shifters bound to the Lord of Wolves-is dying, and nobody can figure out why. Gunnar blames himself for the death of his beloved wife, and he believes she is haunting him.</p> <p>When Kipa asks Raven to examine the shifter, she finds a far deadlier spirit latched on. And the only way Raven can help is to first agree to a deadly alliance with one of the ancient Ante-Fae-Arachna, the Web Weaver. But Arachna's price is far steeper than Raven can afford to pay, and the fallout threatens to shake the very core of Raven's life.</p>";
