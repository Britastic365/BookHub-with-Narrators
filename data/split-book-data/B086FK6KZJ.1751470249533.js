window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This collection includes books one to three of the Star-Crossed Alien Mail Order Brides series, <i>Joran</i>, <i>Vadir</i>, and <i>Kash</i>. Join these three alien males as they go in search of love on the far side of the galaxy, on a primitive planet the resident lifeforms call Earth. <br> </p> <p><b>What do you do when your planet runs out of women? Send for takeout, of course.</b><br> </p> <p><i>Joran </i><br> </p> <p>Joran, Crown Prince of Pyros, needs to claim his mate in order to ascend to the throne one day. The problem? His destined mate isn’t on Pyros. <br> </p> <p>This book contains a redheaded barista who doesn’t believe in aliens, and a prince who is used to getting anything he wants without having to work for it...until now. <br> </p> <p><i>Vadir </i><br> </p> <p>Vadir has a business empire to run and no time to spare on frivolous endeavors. So how did he wind up on the far side of the galaxy to claim a mate he never signed up for? A matchmaking queen and a royal decree, that’s how. <br> </p> <p>This book contains a bohemian blonde with a hell of a right hook, and an interstellar tycoon who is about to learn that the best things in life can’t be bought or sold, they have to be won. <br> </p> <p><i>Kash </i><br> </p> <p>Kash knows he’ll never be allowed to claim a mate. A lifetime of military service has left him too battle-scarred and broken to be considered for the off-world mating project his rulers have created to save their people. <br> </p> <p>This book contains a hopeful romantic who is giving up hope, and a soldier who is about to discover that love doesn’t obey orders, and it can’t be bound by rules.</p>";
