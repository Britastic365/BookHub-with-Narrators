window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Olivia has spent years training to hunt and kill the dangerous savages who live outside the dome which protects her city, and she stands ready to carry out her mission with pride - until the day she is shot down and her life is changed forever. </p> <p>Pulled from the wreckage by a man unlike any she has ever seen - a massive, gruff, yet strangely handsome brute who is not afraid to bare her bottom and spank her soundly to compel her obedience - she is brought into the midst of the people she once sought to wipe out, and her rescuer becomes both her captor and her protector. </p> <p>From the instant he sets eyes upon her, Hayden is certain that there will be a special place in his heart for Olivia. He knows the struggle she will face as she breathes the clean, free air outside the dome and the drugs in her system wear off, leaving her exposed to desires more powerful than she can imagine - desires that he will be more than prepared to fulfill when she is ready. </p> <p>As the days pass, Olivia grows more and more disturbed by what she sees around her - husbands and wives, children and families, all healthy and unharmed by the supposedly poisoned air. Far more disturbing, though, are her growing feelings for Hayden. She finds herself wanting him in a way that she cannot understand, and her need for him grows stronger with every passing hour. She knows that soon she will ask for him to take her, and that when he is finished it will not be long before she kneels at his feet, blushing with shame while begging for more. </p> <p>Publisher's Note: <i>Captive's Desire</i> is an erotic novel that includes spankings, anal play, graphic sexual scenes, elements of BDSM, and more. If such material offends you, please don't buy this book. </p>";
