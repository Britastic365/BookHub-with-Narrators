Hopefully, it doesn’t turn out to be the stupidest...or deadliest.</p> <p>Why can’t things stay the way they were? I love my old job. Supergluing ghosts back together and solving their issues is its own reward. Not to mention, I’m seriously good at it. Although, I must say, I’m ridiculously excited for the new Death Counselor’s arrival in nine months....</p> <p>Adding to my problems, there are four new angels in town who are riding my butt and judging every move I make. Literally. Who knew destroying one Immortal could cause me so much trouble? If I’m found guilty, I’ll be pushing up daisies.</p> <p>Luckily, my nutty friends have my back and the Grim Reaper has my heart. What could possibly go wrong?</p> <p>Nothing is impossible.
