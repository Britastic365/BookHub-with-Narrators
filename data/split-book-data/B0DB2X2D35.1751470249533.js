window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"I will kill the men who murdered your family… for a price. You will be mine.\"</b></p> <p><b>Saint</b></p> <p>Being a hitman is the loneliest of jobs. We don't have many friends. Some don't even have family. Lovers? Try explaining to your boyfriend why there's blood on your shirt.</p> <p>Christmas is the worst time to be alone. This year, love is in the cards for me, all thanks to a letter I found in the street.</p> <p>It reads, \"Dear Santa, all I want for Christmas is revenge…\"</p> <p>At first, I'm intrigued by the words, the grisly details, and the rage steaming off the page. The author doesn't know it yet, but we are a perfect fit. His bloodthirst is equal to mine, his creativity in coming up with ways to kill is admirable, and when I track him down, I instantly fall for the wrath in his dark eyes.</p> <p>His wish is my command if he's ready to pay the price—being mine.</p> <p><b>Rowan</b></p> <p>My therapist always tells me I should let go of my pain and rage. But I don't want to let go. I want the men who attacked my family dead.</p> <p>I never thought I'd get my wish granted. But there's a catch. The handsome monster who abducts me to his lair wants me as his payment.</p> <p>Me, the strange loner filled with bitterness and sarcasm. Me, who never even had a boyfriend. Me, with my cane and irrational fears.</p> <p>I'd sell my soul to the Devil for revenge, so I might as well offer my body to a seductive assassin. After all, he cooks well, kills people, buys me bath bombs… What else could I want in a boyfriend?</p> <p>All I Want for Christmas is Revenge <i>is a standalone M/M dark romance where an obsessive hitman desperate for love zeroes in on a young man willing to trade his life for revenge (and cute Christmas dates). </i> <i>Themes and tropes include: size difference, assassin, mistrust, snowed in, small town, revenge, loneliness, illicit arrangement, possessive hero, past trauma, dark humor, abduction, first love, soulmates, age gap, disabled hero, morally gray.
