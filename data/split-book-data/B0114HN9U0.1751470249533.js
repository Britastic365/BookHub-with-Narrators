window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Catherine Rutherford was a success - a self-made woman from the ground up, she'd had to fight hard for everything she had with only herself to rely on. But she had it all - a great job, a house, friends, a fiancée - well, perhaps not so much in the fiancée area. Glen was not quite what she'd hoped for in a man. He was nice enough - smart and funny and damned good in bed - but also indecisive and passive and quite happy to let her take care of him. She'd always yearned for something more - much more, and much less politically correct. </p> <p>Enter Mrs. Euphemia Jenkins, who ran a kind of curiosity shop that was full of just the kinds of things that had always attracted Cathy almost helplessly - that was, almost anything from the fifties. </p> <p>And Euphemia was in the habit of giving the people - the ones that she felt deserved it - what they wanted most. </p> <p>That was how a modern, 21st-century woman found herself on the floor of a bridal salon in the year 1956, in the arms of a man who looked very much like her fiancée, but was tantalizingly different - confident, attentive, loving - and dominant with a capital D. </p> <p>And as she tries to come to grips with where she was and even tries to create a way to get back, Cathy finds herself falling for a man she believes isn't hers to love. </p>";
