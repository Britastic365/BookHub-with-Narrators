window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Three haunted young men. A terrible curse. One girl who could break it...if this place doesn't break her first.</b></p> <p>I came to Roseborne College looking for answers. This place swallowed my brother whole. What I discover are sadistic teachers who torture more than teach, unearthly sounds that echo through the night, and a wall of roses that holds the students captive.</p> <p>To unravel the mystery of this place, I need the help of three very different, unnervingly appealing guys. Guys who might be just as messed up as I am.</p> <p>Maybe together we can heal each other's wounds. But after the abuse I've endured from the boy who claimed to love me the most, it's hard for me to believe I deserve anything better.</p> <p>I've got to gather my confidence quick, because Roseborne's malicious spirits want to suck the life out of all of us...and the key to defeating them may be a power I didn't even know I held inside me.</p> <p><i>Cursed Studies</i> is a gothic paranormal trilogy with shades of <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>. If you love snarky heroines, damaged heroes, dark secrets galore, and romance with no choosing required, look no further! Just beware: Once you enter Roseborne College, there may be no coming back....</p> <p>This set contains the entire Cursed Studies trilogy: <i>Academy of the Forgotten</i>, <i>Academy of the Forsaken</i>, and <i>Academy of the Fateful</i>.</p>";
