window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This isn't his sister's Wonderland.... </p> <p>Henry never believed his older sister Alice's fantastic tales about the world down the rabbit hole. When he's whisked away to the bizarre land, his best chance for escape is to ally himself with the person called the Mad Hatter. Hatter - an odd but strangely attractive fellow - just wants to avoid execution. If that means delivering \"Boy Alice\" to the Queen of Hearts at her Red Castle, Hatter will do what he has to do to stay alive. It doesn't matter if Henry and Hatter find each other intolerable. They're stuck with each other. </p> <p>Along their journey, Henry and Hatter must confront what they've always accepted as truth. As dislike grows into tolerance and something like friendship, the young men see the chance for a closer relationship. But Wonderland is a dangerous place, and first they have to get away with their lives. </p>";
