Finding my fated mate brought clarity along with a world full of magical creatures and hidden risks.</p> <p>And with that knew knowledge, my past wasn’t quite what it had seemed. I’d been part of this strange world for a lot longer than I’d even known.</p> <p>Add in the fact that the fae dragon king wants Egan and me dead in order to rule over their race in both realms, causing danger to appear at every corner. Not matter what we do, we fall into one trap after another.</p> <p>But we refuse to lie down, because there’s so much more at stake than what meets the eye. We will protect the thunders…even if it kills us.</p>";
