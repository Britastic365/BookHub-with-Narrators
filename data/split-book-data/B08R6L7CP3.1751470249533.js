window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>She has survived inhuman horrors. They will protect her at all costs. But can they save her from the monsters within them?<br> </b><br> For years, the monsters who killed my family have held me in a cage. Brutalized and half-starved. Only kept alive so they can steal my blood.<br> <br> Until one evening when four eerily gorgeous men break me out of my prison.<br> <br> They offer me a safe haven under their protection. A soft bed, delicious food, and all I need to heal. I'm not used to this kindnessâ€”or the desires their smoldering eyes and strong hands stir in my body and my heart.<br> <br> But these fearsome men aren't really men. Like my captors, they're fae who can shift into wolves. A curse gripping the faerie realm turns them wild under the full moon, and only my blood can cure their rage.<br> <br> As long as I'm a prize more than a person, how can I trust their kindness?<br> <br> I've survived this long without giving up. Somehow this damaged human girl will hold her own among the savage wolves.<br> <br> *<i>Captive of Wolves</i> is the first in a fantasy romance series featuring possessive wolf shifters, dangerous fae politics, and a wounded heroine finding her strength. Grab it now and get swept away in the fantasy!*<br> <br> Note: The story contains scenes of physical abuse and emotional trauma dealt by the villains but no sexual violence. All intimate moments are consensual, and there is no abuse from the love interests.</p> <p>Perfect for fans of morally grey but protective men, sweet heroines, chosen and fated mates, forced proximity, enemies to lovers romance, disability rep, and plenty of plot twists.</p>";
