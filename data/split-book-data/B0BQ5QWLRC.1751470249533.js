window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"A unique, delightful, hilarious, unputdownable romance… I’m wonderstruck by </b><b><i>The Blonde Identity</i></b><b>!\" — Ali Hazelwood, </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author of </b><b><i>The Love Hypothesis</i></b></p> <p><b>The </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling YA author of the beloved Gallagher Girls series bursts onto the adult scene with a fast-paced, hilarious road trip rom-com about a woman with amnesia who discovers she’s the identical twin sister of a rogue spy… and must team up with a rugged, grumpy operative to stay alive.</b></p> <p>It’s the middle of the night in the middle of Paris and a woman just woke up with no memory.</p> <p>She only knows three things for certain:</p> <p>1. She has a splitting headache.</p> <p>2. The hottest guy she has (probably) ever seen is standing over her, telling her to <i>run</i>.</p> <p>And oh yeah…</p> <p>3. People keep trying to kill her.</p> <p>She doesn’t know who. Or why. But when she sees footage of herself fighting off a dozen men there’s only one explanation: <i>obviously</i>. . . <i>she’s a spy!</i></p> <p>Except, according to Mr. Hot Guy, she’s not. She’s a spy’s identical twin sister.</p> <p>Too bad the only person who knows she’s not the woman they’re looking for is this very grouchy, very sexy, very secret agent who (reluctantly) agrees to help her disappear. Which is easier said than done when a criminal organization wants you dead and every intelligence service in the world wants you caught.</p> <p>Luckily, no one is looking for a pair of lovesick newlyweds on their honeymoon. And soon they’re lying their way across Europe—dodging bullets and faking kisses as they race to unravel a deadly conspiracy and clear her sister’s name.</p> <p>But with every secret they uncover, the truth shifts, until she no longer knows who to trust: the twin she can’t remember or the mysterious man she can’t let herself forget…</p> <p><b>\"\"Spies! Amnesia! And banter that’ll make you chant “Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!” No one writes an action rom-com quite like Ally Carter.\"\" – Rachel Hawkins, </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author of </b><b><i>The Wife Upstairs</i></b></p>";
