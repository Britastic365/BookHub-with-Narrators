Now all of our fates are riding on the dice I’m about to throw and luck never was on our side.</p> <p>I was whole once, with my boys in this slice of paradise we’d carved out for ourselves, but in the time that we were parted we grew up. Grew apart. And as much as I might have yearned to reclaim that girl with the sand between her toes and the sun on her cheeks, it’s time I admit that I spent too long in the shadows to ever truly be her again.</p> <p>My heart may be breaking for the men I left behind, but I know that I can make that pain count for something, because I’m no fool believing the pretty promises of a mad man. No. I’m the assassin he just opened his fortress to.</p> <p>And now that I’m inside, I intend to repay him for every moment of suffering he has inflicted upon me and my boys.</p> <p>Shawn Mackenzie thought he killed me once upon a time. Now this dead girl is back to return the favour.</p>";
