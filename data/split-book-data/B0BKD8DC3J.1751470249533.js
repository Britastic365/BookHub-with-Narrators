window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>For Hanna Harvey, happily ever is just the beginning . . . of a hot mess. Now mated to darkly dangerous but irresistibly seductive werewolf, Mark Abernathy, she's finding that life isn't the endless cheese and whisky fueled boinkfest she'd imagined it to be. Plagued by terrifying nightmares of a mysterious entity bent on her destruction and drowning in her new responsibilities as the alpha female of the werewolf world, she's begun to doubt that she really is the heir.</p> <p>When certain werewolf factions refuse to acknowledge Hanna's rule, what begins as a clan rivalry threatens to erupt into the first shifter war in centuries. Which is like, the worst. As is the return of Hanna's former flame and neophyte vampire, Detective James Morrison.</p> <p>Hoping to stave off the shifter Apocalypse, Hanna and Abernathy travel to The Gathering, where a mysterious figure from Abernathy's past reveals a closely guarded secret with the power to break not only her heart, but their sworn bond as mates. With the fate of the werewolf world resting squarely on her bony shoulders, Hanna must now decide to trust the wildness within, or abandon the shifter world forever.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
