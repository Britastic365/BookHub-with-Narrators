window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>They rule my new town, my school, and with more money than God, thereâ€™s very little out of their reach. </p> <p>Four gorgeous, perfect, scary boys. There used to be five, but one of them died, leaving a fifth position that I now fill. </p> <p>I didn't ask for this. I didn't want to be part of this billionaire-boys-club. But no one cares about what I want. </p> <p>Sebastian Beckett is the worst of them. Their leader. He draws me in, and strips me of every defense I have. He calls me Butterfly, but it's not a pet name, it's a threat. Beck wants nothing more than to break my wings, pin me to a board and watch me writhe. </p> <p>He wants to see me broken. Body, heart, and soul.</p> <p>And what these elite want, they get. </p> <p>Only they've never met Riley Jameson. </p> <p>Let the battle begin. </p> <p><b>This dark contemporary romance features one girl and four sexy, dangerous boys but is not a reverse harem.</b></p>";
