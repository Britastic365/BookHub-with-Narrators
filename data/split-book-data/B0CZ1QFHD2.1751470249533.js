window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>One cold December night, I let myself enjoy a beautiful stranger I’d met in the cage at my Family’s seedy fight club.</p> <p>Afterwards, I kissed him goodbye and sent him away, content to cling to memories of the out-of-towner who’d pleased me so thoroughly.</p> <p>Except that beautiful butterfly wasn’t who he claimed to be, and our lives would soon intertwine in a much more permanent way.</p> <p>We worked side-by-side with our families to rid the City of the malevolent dictators that ruled so cruelly over it for generations—including my soulless sister, who’d held my leash for years.</p> <p>In the City’s new era of peace, I’m enjoying my freedom and my job working for the rightful queen, Jolie Knight, but I still can’t seem to escape her brother—and the things he makes me feel that I would rather not.</p> <p>When my mother disappears after breaking my heart one final time, the sexy, charismatic Max Miller invites himself along on my journey to save her—or, perhaps, to let her go for good.</p> <p>And this beautiful boy looks at me as though he plans to stick around, even after our mission is complete.</p> <p>I’m the notorious Frankie “Fingers” Ferrero. I strike fear into the hearts of those that would harm my family. I slip through the shadows and decimate small armies single handedly. I take appendages from my victims as trophies and bathe in their blood with a smile.</p> <p>Falling in love is not for me.</p> <p>Max Miller begs to differ.</p> <p><i>This is a New Adult, </i><b><i>M/M</i></b><i> dark romance novella in the “A Knight’s Revenge” universe. For maximum enjoyment, you should listen to the full trilogy prior to starting Max &amp; Frankie’s story. As always, this is for listeners age </i><b><i>18+</i></b><i> and contains a ton of foul language, very steamy scenes, and violent themes.</i></p>";
