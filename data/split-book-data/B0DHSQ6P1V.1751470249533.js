They race modified cars, throw parties to conceal their morbid games, and leave behind the kind of chaos that can never be tamed.</p> <p>They were from an ancient bloodline of the three Founding Fathers, and it was almost time for them to plunge deeper into the depths of hell. Now that they were all on their motherland, and even closer to an island with history as dark as it was ruthless, no one had a say in the carnage of what was to come. And in this case, with War and Halen. Until now, they were nothing but exactly as they appeared on the outside.</p> <p>He was a brother's best friend, and a boy Halen had never not known.</p> <p>She was the daughter of one of the most feared families known to man, and the only girl who ever kindled his rage. They'd push and pull until it tore them apart… if only to feel the shell of their bodies close.</p> <p>Halen knew crossing that line with him was dangerous ground, yet she yielded her weapon and did it anyway. But history was being challenged, and The Kings were about to learn that not all enemies are discovered on a battlefield.</p> <p>Some are the ghosts of what was left behind.</p>";
