window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A new novella set in the best-selling, award-winning Beyond series.</b> </p> <p>Mia risked everything to walk away from a gilded cage in Sector Two, but grasping at freedom was only her first trial. With no protection in the sectors, every day is a struggle to stay alive. Her best hope now is a job working for the most dangerous gang in Sector Four - the O'Kanes. </p> <p>When a motorcycle accident leaves Derek Ford riding a desk at the O'Kane compound, the last thing he needs is a sexy new assistant upending his office and his life. Especially someone like Mia, who greets his growls and commands with smiles and a fierce independence. </p> <p>The friction between them generates an undeniable heat, and Mia's stubborn refusal to let life beat her down stirs Ford's darkest protective instincts. He has the power to take care of her, protect her not only from discomfort but from threats of her past...but first he'd have to claim her. </p> <p>And Mia will never be kept again. </p> <p>This novella was originally published in the <i>Alphas After Dark</i> collection in April 2014 and takes place during the events of <i>Beyond Jealousy</i>. </p>";
