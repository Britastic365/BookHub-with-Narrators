window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From author Thea Harrison comes the latest story in the New York Times best-selling Moonshadow trilogy.... </b> </p> <p>Kidnapped while on tour, musician Sidonie Martel is transported to the mystical land of Avalon. A human without magical ability, she is completely vulnerable to the deadly forces surrounding her. </p> <p>When she defies her captors and refuses to share her music, an act of violent cruelty leaves her broken, her ability to play silenced, maybe forever. Her only hope is a whisper in the dark, gentle hands that offer healing, and a man who refuses to show her his face yet who offers advice she dare not ignore. </p> <p>One of the most feared and powerful sorcerers in history, Morgan le Fae serves a queen he despises, Isabeau of the Light Court. Once a famous bard and an advisor to kings, Morgan has been enslaved to Isabeau for hundreds of years, acting as enforcer and the commander of her deadly Hounds. </p> <p>Sidonie's music touches Morgan in places he had abandoned centuries ago, and her fiery spirit resurrects feelings he had believed long dead. For Sidonie, trapped in captivity, passion offers a comfort she cannot resist. </p> <p>But Isabeau holds Morgan bound in magical chains that only Death can break. <i>And in the court of a cruel, jealous queen, the only thing that burns hotter than love is revenge...</i> </p>";
