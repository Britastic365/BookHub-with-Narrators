window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Lola Landry stares through the window of her locked car with the keys in the ignition and the radio blaring Beck’s “Loser”. While standing there and sweltering in the soupy Tennessee humidity, she wonders how her orderly life had crashed and burned so badly. Then her high school nemesis saunters up in all of his tall, strapping fireman-to-the-rescue glory, slapping her with the humiliating proof that it can always get worse.</p> <p>When the uber-confident Jedediah Lawson requests a date in return for popping her lock, a lightbulb goes off. Revenge is sweet. He would make the perfect victim—guest, that is—for her next podcast episode on <i>Kiss and Tell</i>. What shocks her is the casual way he not only agrees to the post-date interview on air, but ends up hijacking her audience and wooing them with his swoony Southern charm. Not even a low score on the date-o-meter can dissuade the man or keep her fans from demanding more of the charismatic Jed.</p> <p>What’s worse: She secretly wants a second date with this man who is so different from his teenage self. His unwavering patience and dimpled smile erodes her will, until she breaks the<i> Kiss and Tell</i> rules by agreeing to a second…and a third date. It’s a disaster. Not the date. They’re wonderful. The disaster is that she is falling for a man she once dubbed Jockstrap Jed.</p> <p><i>Parks and Provocation</i> is a full-length contemporary romance and can be enjoyed as a stand-alone. Book two in the Green Valley Heroes series, Green Valley Chronicles, Penny Reid Book Universe.</p>";
