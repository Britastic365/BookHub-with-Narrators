window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Number 99, Dash Taylor. Rookie defensive end for the Boston Tomcats. Two hundred eighty-five pounds of fast-twitch muscle. Nickname: Big D.</p> <p>This tiny dancer doesn’t think I’m boyfriend material. I used to think that too. I’ve been a beast on the field and in the bedroom, but now I’m going to prove that I can be a man for her...and for our surprise baby....</p> <p>See, I had a bad attitude my whole life, and that’s why my college coach sent me to take ballet lessons as punishment. The real punishment? Being taught to plié by a beautiful ballerina who refused to date me. Two years later, when we’re both professionals, I get a second chance to show her what Big D’s all about.</p> <p>I thought I’d sack her by being the guy who can make his pecs dance to the beat of any song. But it isn't the other team’s offensive line who brings me to my knees, it’s a sophisticated hundred-pound ballerina. She sets me straight like no one else ever could.</p> <p>I thought I was all about the smash and dash.</p> <p>But getting Charlie Bardot pregnant changed <a href=\"http://everything.br/\">everything.</a></p> <p>This is a duet, multicast audiobook production!</p>";
