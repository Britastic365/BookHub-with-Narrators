I’ve had to do his bidding, but now that he’s gone this is my chance for a fresh start. Until Sebastian arrives.</p> <p>Not even the darkest black magic spell can fool a vampire this dangerous. Seb says he owns me. That the contract is still valid. And if I leave, he’ll imprison me.</p> <p>His arrogance makes my blood boil. But Seb has taken a liking to me and proposes a deal. The contract is business, but he and I could be all about pleasure.</p> <p>He’s got another thing coming if he thinks I’m going to become his plaything. There’s no way I’m telling him I’m still a virgin when he’s so sinfully sexy. That would only make him more determined to make me his.</p> <p>It seems I’m not the only one who has a problem with Sebastian. A sect of rogue vampires is hell-bent on overthrowing the reign of the new vampire prince. And it looks like I’m caught right in the middle...</p>";
