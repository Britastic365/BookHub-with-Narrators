She's tired of men stringing her along into being their forever girlfriend, so she decides to build a rotating harem and ruthlessly eliminate any man, who fails to give her what she needs. But when the three men in her current dating rotation all know each other, and decide they're all taking her, will she be played once again?<br> <br> <b><i>The Sacrifice</i></b><b> (Book 2)</b></p> <p>Always the bridesmaid, never the bride. Macy caught the bouquet at Livia's wedding and now finds herself engaged to William, a nice enough man she knew from college, but she isn't attracted to him.
