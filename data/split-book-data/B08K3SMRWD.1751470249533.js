I have a magical form of synesthesia that senses danger and uncovers lies - making me a stealthy operative. </p> <p>I’m trudging through another day when one of Section’s cleaners - assassins - takes an interest in me. I don’t need my synesthesia to realize that he is extremely dangerous and that he will do anything to achieve his goals - even if it means putting me in the line of fire.</p> <p><b><i>...and an assassin </i></b></p> <p>I’m Desmond Percy, one of Section 47’s most lethal cleaners. I’m also a man on a mission, and I need Charlotte Locke’s skills to help me keep a promise, settle a score, and kill some extremely bad people. </p> <p>Charlotte might not like me, but we’re stuck together until my mission is over. Still, the more time we spend together, the more I’m drawn to her. But at Section 47, you never know who you can trust - or who might want you dead.</p>";
