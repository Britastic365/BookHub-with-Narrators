His strongest supporters are gone, and his wife has left him, a fact that will destroy him if it comes out. To keep his position - and to stay alive - he needs to get her back, whatever the cost. Cathy has finally escaped the Nether but finds her reliance on Sam's protection chafing. When the mysterious sorceress, Bea, offers her a chance to earn true freedom, Cathy makes a deal with her. But can she and Sam work out the best way to navigate Bea's plans for the future without becoming another of her victims?

As their fundamental beliefs in the way the Worlds work falters, they have to make difficult choices about where their loyalties lie. </p>";
