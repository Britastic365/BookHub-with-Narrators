window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I should walk away, find some puck bunny to gleefully sit on my lap and tell me what a big, hot hockey stud I am - totally true, BTW. But there’s just something about this feisty redhead I can’t let go. She’s got an edge to her that’s sexy as hell and a smart mouth that’s been tying me up since the night I met her.</p> <p>She tells me to forget it, we’re not happening. But she’s not the kind of woman a guy ever forgets. Especially when the air starts to sizzle and pop every time we get within 10 feet of each other. She’s in my head and under my skin, and all I can think about is the way she looked at me that one time - like she already knew how it could be between us.</p> <p>I’m not the kind of guy a girl like her takes home...but maybe I want to be.</p>";
