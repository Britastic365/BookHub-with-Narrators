window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Have you ever heard of the old Celtic legends of the Fae - beautiful, magical, deadly, and a love of messing with humans just for kicks and giggles?</b></p> <p><b>Welcome to my world.</b></p> <p>What started out as a strange assignment leads to one of the most gruesome murder mysteries of our time, and my friends and I are set and determined to find out who is killing off Fae and Witches alike.</p> <p>Couple of problems in the way - I hate the Fae, and the Prince of the Dark Fae is bound and determined that I work for him. He’s a rude, overbearing, egotistical ass with a compulsive need to possess, dominate, and control me. Oh - did I mention that he is absolutely sex-on-a-stick gorgeous and he makes me feel things that I never ever wanted to feel for a Fae.... Every time he touches me or looks at me with those golden eyes, he seems to pull me further in under his spell, despite my better judgment.</p> <p>My friends and I can’t trust anyone, and nothing is as it seems on the surface - not even me.</p> <p><b>Warning: Mature content and language not intended for anyone under the age of 18.</b></p> <p>This audiobook is not intended for anyone under the age of 18, or anyone who doesn't like lip biting, throw-your-ass-on-the-bed, tear-your-clothes-off-and-leave-you-panting dominant alpha male characters. This is a dark, dangerous, intense, gritty, and raw audiobook. Scenes are dark, disturbing, and scorching-hot. This is a soul-crushing, tear-jerking, and leave-you-hanging-on-the-edge-of-your-seat fast-paced audiobook. Side effects may include, but are not limited to: drooling, lip biting, wet panties, crying, and screaming at the author. If any of these things happen, do not seek medical attention - get the next book in the series and enjoy the ride!</p> <p>Revised copy: February, 23, 2015.</p>";
