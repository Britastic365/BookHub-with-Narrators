window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Ironside is more than a regular academy. It’s also the biggest reality TV show in the world … and a very elaborate, very luxurious prison.</p> <p>Their hallowed halls are ruled by the Betas, Omegas, and Deltas—but this year, the officials are stirring things up.</p> <p>Isobel Carter—the only rare Sigma to be accepted—is the first sign. But there are others. Many others. A sudden influx of powerful Alphas will turn academy life, and Isobel’s life, upside down.</p> <p>She might be the lowest rung on the ladder, but in order to survive Ironside, where social media is king and consequences are deadly, she will need to make her mark.</p> <p>She will need to climb.</p> <p>This isn’t a game for the faint of heart, and those who rise should be prepared for a beautiful, brutal fall.</p> <p>Beware the pretty posers, because this social media game just got dangerous.</p> <p>The Hunger Games collides with America's Got Talent, and you've just been invited to binge it all in high definition. But here's some viewer discretion before you continue:This series has as many love interests as enemies, with all the focus on the main character. Expect a delicious slow burn where you'll never have to pick your favourite shade of morally grey.</p> <p>Listeners, meet your new guilty pleasure.</p> <p>Now it's time to grab some popcorn and dive right in!</p>";
