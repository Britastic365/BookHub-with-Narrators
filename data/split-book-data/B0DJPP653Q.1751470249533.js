window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A new winter holiday, enemies-to-lovers romance, from the undeniably funny and always spicy, USA Today bestselling author, Meghan <a href=\"http://quinn.living/\">Quinn</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://quinn.living/\">Living</a> in a year around Christmas town has its drawbacks. The caroling, the decorations, the insanely cheery spirit, it never disappears. It's why I like to hibernate away in my cave - I mean housekeeping a healthy distance from the holly jolly spirits.</p> <p>And all was going according to plan until my nemesis, Storee Taylor, moved in next door to care for her Aunt Cindy. Without blinking, she turned my simple world into a real nightmare-before-Christmas, especially when she decided to enter the town Christmas Kringle contest - which she was determined to win.</p> <p>Well guess what? Over my cold-hearted body.</p> <p>There was no way I was going to let her win, not after the history we'd <a href=\"http://shared.so/\">shared</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://shared.so/\">So</a> despite my promise to myself of never participating in the sickening Christmas season, I entered the competition as well. That's right, I planned on beating Storee at her own game by pretending this grumpâ€™s heart grew three sizes this season.</p> <p>And it was working until feelings between us started heating up.</p> <p>We pretended to date.</p> <p>We kissed.</p> <p>And well, sparks flew from there.</p> <p>Which led to one explosive night involving Christmas lights, the competition, and a ladder. Don't let me convince you who stole Christmas, I think you need to find out for yourself . . .</p>";
