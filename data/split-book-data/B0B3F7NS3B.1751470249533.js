window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The Demon King crossed over to our world looking for something. What he found was me. </b></p> <p>Apparently I possess part of the Demon King’s lost power and now he wants it back. He’s willing to do anything for it...including seducing me. The entire world wants a piece of Wrath and I’m the one who gets him every night in my bed. </p> <p>I shouldn’t want him as badly as I do, but being around him is...<i>consuming</i>. </p> <p>And I think he feels it, too. As much as the Demon King wants to pretend it’s only about power, I’ve seen the way he looks at me. When we’re in the same room together, every glance is sharp enough to cut, every touch hot enough to burn.</p> <p>But when a secret from my past is revealed, it throws everything into question once again. Now Wrath is looking at me like I’m the enemy, and the Demon King will destroy everything in his path in order to get what he wants. </p> <p>If he wants a fight, he’s going to get one. Because this stolen power I possess? Now I know how to use it.</p> <p><b>Note:</b><b><i> Sinful Demon King</i></b><b> is the second book in a villain enemies-to-lovers paranormal romance trilogy. You can expect lots of tension, action, twists, and hate kissing, and a villain you love to love. </b><b><i>Sinful Demon King</i></b><b> ends on a cliff-hanger, but book three is out now and the trilogy is complete. Please check the author's website for CWs.</b></p>";
