Decrepit intentions finally come to light. And now truths are ready to be incinerated in the open for everyone to witness.</p> <p>I was ready to watch this town that made me the villain rot in front of my eyes, but it seems ghosts don't stay buried here. Everyone's favorite sweetheart has returned to Hollow Heights dragging nothing but unanswered questions and grim memories behind her.</p> <p>A distraction I can't afford with the police sniffing around.
