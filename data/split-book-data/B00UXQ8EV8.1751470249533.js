window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Awakening wounded in a darkened cell, their psychic abilities blocked, Aden and Zaira know they must escape. But when the lethal soldiers break free from their mysterious prison, they find themselves in a harsh, inhospitable landscape far from civilization. And they must survive. A shadowy enemy has put a target on the back of the Arrow squad - an enemy that cannot be permitted to succeed in its deadly campaign. </p> <p>Aden will cross any line to keep his people safe for this new future, where even an assassin might have hope of a life beyond blood and death and pain. Zaira has no such hope. Her driving goal is to protect Aden - protect the only person who has ever come back for her no matter what. This time even Aden's passionate determination may not be enough - because the emotionless chill of Silence existed for a reason. For the violent and the insane and the irreparably broken...like Zaira. </p>";
