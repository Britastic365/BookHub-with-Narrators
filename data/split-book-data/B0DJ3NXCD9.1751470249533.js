That accident turns out to be angry, foul-mouthed, rude and, well . . .</p> <p>Just like Nina.</p> <p>Primrose Dunham has been accidentally turned into a fairy. As if she wasn't already angry enough with the world, now she has sporadic powers she can't control, pointy ears, and a weird hump on her back that everyone keeps calling a \"wing.\"</p> <p>If that's not enough of a shock, a vampire, a werewolf, and a halfsie come to her \"rescue\" . . . whether she wants them to help or not.</p> <p>Oh, and the man she's been trying to avoid-the literal boy next door and her one-time bestie, Rafferty Monroe-gets turned as well, thanks to Primrose!</p> <p>It'll take more than a Christmas miracle to thaw Prim's frosty attitude, protect her from her sinister stepfather, and figure out why there's a price on her head in the fairy world. But it's nothing the OOPs ladies-along with assorted paranormal friends and framily-can't handle. Right?</p>";
