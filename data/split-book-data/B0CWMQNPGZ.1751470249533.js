window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The Azathe Tea Room is a strange place. There are no servers, no menus—do mind our hostess, though, she can get a bit underfoot! Help yourself to a book while you wait, and be sure to shuffle your tarot deck well before placing your order.</p> <p>Harper Hollingsworth wasn't looking for a friend. She wanted peace and quiet. Someplace to lose herself in a book and not think about being a misfit; not think about her coven or her disconnect from the craft as her mother taught it. She didn't want to think about her lack of magical ambition, as she was regularly told by her mother's poison-tongued familiar, and more than that—she didn't want to feel. Anything.</p> <p>Companionship wasn't her aim the day she stepped into the odd little tea room. She wanted to settle into the shadows and get lost there, and if she had to talk to anyone, it would be to herself.</p> <p>The shadowy proprietor of the Azathe Tea Room isn't content to watch Harper sink into depression within the walls of their establishment. Once they intervene, Harper is drawn into their world of oddity and emotions, where the darkest shadows can reside in the light, and even the most mildly macabre witch can find her place.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
