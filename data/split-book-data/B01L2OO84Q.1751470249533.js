The former Navy SEAL who'd broken her heart.</b> </p> <p>Clara's gone wild. </p> <p>Naked. Cuffed. Caged. Is this the sweet senator's daughter I left behind? </p> <p>I didn't know it was her when I rushed into that room filled with flames, but I'll never let her go again. </p> <p>She's proposed a unique way to thank me. It could bring us both to the edge of ecstasy - or to the point of no return. </p> <p>Clara wants to submit. <i>To me.</i> Totally. Damn any limits. The very thought of it has brought me back from the dead. </p> <p>But a stranger is watching from the shadows. He's made us <i>his</i> fantasy. And he plays rougher than I do. Where he's taking us now is somewhere so dark and so dangerous that this time it could be inescapable. </p>";
