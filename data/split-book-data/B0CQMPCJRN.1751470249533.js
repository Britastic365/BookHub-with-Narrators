window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>I'm not a powerful witch, just a fortune teller making ends meet.</b></p> <p>When my grandmother, the leader of the Rathmore Coven, summons me, I have no choice but to answer her call. To reach her, I must cross the Wood, the realm of Wotan, lord of the hunt. Rumors of his cruelty and brutality precede him, but nothing prepares me to meet the monster face to face.</p> <p>Because Wotan is more than a monster. He's a predator, a bully, and now he's claimed me as his pawn in his war against my grandmother. A master of torture, he's determined to master me, stripping me bare of all my secrets.</p> <p>As much as I fear him, I'm drawn to him. His rough edges conceal a softer side—and I find myself wondering if I can be the one to finally tame him. With my life hanging in the balance, I've got to fight to uncover the truth about Wotan, my grandmother… and maybe my own destiny.</p>";
