window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Dahlia kept her powers a secret for most of her life before she was captured. Years after her escape she once again finds herself falling into the wrong hands—right before finding herself in some extra-large lycan hands. Shifters are real, and the Alpha wolf wants to make her his. Does he have what it takes to keep her safe? Can he protect her from herself?</p> <p>When Gideon’s path crosses with a feisty earth-wielding Celestial, he’s forced to choose between what is best for the pack, or for himself. He barely has time to deal with his unruly wolf and mountain of responsibilities, let alone a mate. His loyalties are put to the test when a family friend proposes a union of their packs…by marriage. Can he choose duty over destiny?</p>";
