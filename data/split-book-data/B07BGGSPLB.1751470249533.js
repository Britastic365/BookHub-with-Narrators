window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Sherrilyn Kenyon has created a sensation with her sexy stories about the Bureau of American Defense. Now, three novellas about BAD agents are collected in one steamy volume! </p> <p>In the all-new <i>One BAD Night</i>, the bureau believes that agent Jason Banks has sold them out. Agent Samantha Winslow has never particularly cared for Jason, whom she reluctantly finds attractive, and she volunteers to bring him in. Under orders to infiltrate his rogue mission and kidnap him, she is also trying to pull off the ultimate double-cross. But who would have guessed that Jason would be so pleased to be her captive? </p> <p>In <i>BAD to the Bone</i>, Marianne wins the Hideaway Heroine Sweepstakes and a chance to pretend to be the heroine in her favorite romance novel. Whisked away to a remote island, Marianne's daydreams become real when BAD agent Kyle Foster kidnaps her and uncovers her every fantasy. </p> <p>In <i>\"Captivated\" by You</i>, BAD agent Rhea must go undercover as a dominatrix to capture a deadly terrorist. Fortunately, Agent \"Ace\" Krux, whom she has long desired, is her training partner. Immediately, the roles of master and slave are wonderfully blurred, and Rhea and Ace unleash a wealth of hidden desire.</p>";
