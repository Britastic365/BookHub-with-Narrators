window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Innocence Claimed</i> contains all three books in the sweet, filthy, and oh-so-wrong in the best kind of way Innocence Claimed series.</p> <p><i>His Little Bad Girl</i>, book 1:</p> <p>Her name is Tempest Kensington. She’s never been touched. She’s my student; I'm her headmaster. But I want to know how sweet she tastes when she’s claimed for the first time. Screw the consequences. I know I’m blurring the lines, but I. Do. Not. Care. Tempest Kensington is a grade-A brat. And she’s about to get a very thick, very firm dose of my discipline - over my knee and on hers.</p> <p>Barely appropriate. Entirely off-limits. My ruin, in a plaid skirt and knee-high socks. It’s time for this little tease to learn exactly what happens to bad girls who look for trouble.</p> <p><i>Tempting Daddy's Boss</i>, book 2:</p> <p>An angel like little Lyra Worthington has no business being anywhere near a cold, calculating monster like me. But she’s been mine since the second she poured herself into my world. And now, I’m never letting her go.</p> <p>I know she’s off-limits. I know she’s too young for me, and too innocent, and too untouched. But I bet she tastes like heaven and feels like sin, and tonight, I plan on finding out how right I am.</p> <p><i>Paying the Debt</i>, book 3:</p> <p>Some people call me a demon - a bad bad man who does very bad things. They’re not wrong. But that’s before she falls into my life - the too pure, too innocent, too untouched Skye Jensen. She’s too good for a filthy mafia king like me, but my interest has turned to obsession.</p> <p>The piece of garbage who put her up as collateral at a card game he couldn’t win never deserved her anyways. And now she’s mine. All of her. I’ll be a ruthless monster to the rest of the world, but never to her. I’ll fight the whole damn world to keep her safe. Because what’s mine is mine. Forever.</p> <p><i>If you’re looking for something wildly dirty, not really grounded in reality, and safe, this one’s for you! Utterly obsessed alpha hero, sassy, untouched heroine, and insta-love, smut, and sugary-sweetness galore. HEA with no cheating.</i></p>";
