window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"We're the D'Artigo sisters: half-human, half-Fae. We're sexy, we're savvy, and we just turned in our badges to the Otherworld Intelligence Agency. My sister Camille is a wicked-good witch. Delilah's a werecat and blossoming Death Maiden. And as for me? I'm Menolly, acrobat-extraordinaire-turned-vampire. But being a vamp isn't all it's cracked up to be, especially when the Godfather of all vampires decides to play Prince Charming.... It's the holiday season, and a vampire serial killer is on the loose. Hungry ghosts are tearing up the town, and people are running scared. I strike a deal with Ivana Krask - one of the Elder Fae - and, too late, discover strings are attached. But when I turn to Roman, one of the oldest, most powerful vampires around, for help, he offers me more than I ever bargained for.\"</p>";
