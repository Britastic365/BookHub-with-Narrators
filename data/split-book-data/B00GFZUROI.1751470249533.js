window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>For two months, Jamie Garland had fallen in love... with a lie. Cade Santerre was every woman's fantasy - until the mask came off in a scandal that left Jamie shattered. </p> <p>Cade had pretended to be someone he wasn't. Worse, he'd used her in his elaborate attempt to catch a man he believed was a crook and a swindler. Though Cade's suspect had escaped, Cade was still around - raw, masculine, overwhelming. He had some unfinished business with the man who had conned his innocent sister, and he needed Jamie's help. But Jamie had some unfinished business, as well: to find out if the man she'd fallen in love with really existed. </p>";
