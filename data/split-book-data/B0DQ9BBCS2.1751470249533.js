window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>What’s the actual last thing you’d ever want your celebrity crush to see you doing when you finally come face-to-excruciatingly-handsome-face with him? Singing and dancing around by yourself to “Dreams” by The Cranberries while drinking straight from a bottle of champagne? While you’re wearing some wedding gown you just found in a closet? Yeah. Me too.</p> <p>And yet, here we are.</p> <p>At a mountain cabin I was sent to by the awfully pretty actress/pretty awful human I work for to get things ready for<i> her</i> romantic New Year’s Eve getaway with him. That’s not even the worst thing about the way I meet Holden Archer. The actress has been paying me to have textual relations with him, pretending to be her—and she doesn’t even like him!<br> <br> Is it terrible that a snowstorm prevents us from leaving and the actress from getting here? Neither Holden nor I think so. Because it turns out <i>our</i> connection goes back a lot further than those texts. And just like in all my favorite romantic comedies,<i> it’s what got us here that is the most amazing part of the story.</i><br> <br> Will my lack of experience cause me to freeze up when we go from inbox to in person? Or will a dreamy movie star melt my inhibitions and make all my secret New Year wishes come true?</p> <p>*This is DUET NARRATION*</p>";
