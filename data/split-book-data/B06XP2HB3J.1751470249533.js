Millennia later, a curse has transformed him into a demonic monster - just as she's been reincarnated. Sian captures the delicate but bold female, forcing her back to hell. </p> <p><b>Meets his match.</b> </p> <p>Princess Calliope \"Lila\" Barbot's people have hated and feared Abyssian and his alliance of monsters for eons. When the beastly demon imprisons her in his mystical castle, vowing revenge for betrayals she can't remember, Lila makes her own vow: to bring down the wicked beast for good. </p> <p><b>Can two adversaries share one happily ever after? </b></p> <p>As Calliope turns hell inside out, the all-powerful Sian finds himself defenseless against his feelings for her. In turn Lila reluctantly responds to the beast's cleverness and gruff vulnerability.
