window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I thought I'd found a way to destroy the malicious power Roseborne College held over all its students - but I seem to have unleashed a host of fresh horrors, instead. The school's ruling spirits are flying free, even more intent on tormenting us. Visions from the worst moments of our pasts are stalking us like ghosts, and my foster brother may have fallen too far into his monstrous nature to be saved.</p> <p>It's all I can do to try to protect myself and the three guys I've fallen for here, let alone the rest of the school's inhabitants. On top of that, the supernatural energies I've just discovered in myself have desires all of their own.</p> <p>As our most awful mistakes consume us, can we hold onto enough faith to keep up the struggle? And how much of myself will I have to sacrifice for a single chance at freedom? </p> <p><b><i>Academy of the Fateful</i></b><b> is the third and final book in a Gothic paranormal trilogy with shades of \"Beauty and the Beast\". If you love snarky heroines, damaged heroes, dark secrets galore, and reverse harem romance with no choosing required, look no further! Just beware! Once you enter Roseborne College, there may be no coming back.</b></p>";
