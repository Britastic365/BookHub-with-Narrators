window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>My whole world changed when I stepped inside the academy. Nothing is right about this place or the other students in it. Here I am, a mere mortal among gods...or monsters. I still can't decide which of these warring factions I belong to, if I belong at all. I only know the one thing that unites them is their hatred of me.</p> <p>Then there's Jaxon Vega. A vampire with deadly secrets who hasn't felt anything for a hundred years. But there's something about him that calls to me, something broken in him that somehow fits with what's broken in me.</p> <p>Which could spell death for us all.</p> <p>Because Jaxon walled himself off for a reason. And now someone wants to wake a sleeping monster, and I'm wondering if I was brought here intentionally—as the bait.</p> <p>Adapted from the novel and produced with a full cast of actors, immersive sound effects and cinematic music.</p> <p>Performed by Melody Muze, Wyn Delano, Yenn Ann, Anthony Palmini, Julienne Irons, Gabriel Michael, Eric Messner, Melody Muze, Alejandro Ruiz, Aure Nash, Bradley Foster Smith, Chris Stinson, Colleen Delany, David Cui Cui, Donald Guzzi, Drew Kopas, Karen Novack, Megan Hastie, Michael John Casey, Nora Achrati, Robb Moreira, Scott McCormick, Steve Wannall, Sura Sui, Tia Shearer, and Yasmin Tuazon.</p>";
