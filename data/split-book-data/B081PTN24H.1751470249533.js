Unless I want to get sucked out of existence, I need to spread some love around, and fast.</p> <p>The clock is ticking, but I have the perfect candidate to start with. Warren Knight. Smart, hot as hell, rich, bachelor-dud extraordinaire. No matter how many dates he goes on, he just won’t seal the deal. It’s time I fix him. And fix me too.</p> <p>Of course, the asshole doesn’t want to fall in love, so I have my work cut out for me. They say there’s no rest for the wicked. Well, they should try being a cupid, because this shit is exhausting. Here goes nothing.</p>";
