window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Chelsea didn't mind being a club girl. Who wouldn't want a group of possessive alpha males on your side and in your bed? The freedom and the lifestyle allowed her to spread her wings while the rules and bylaws kept everyone in line. It was comfortable - safe.</p> <p>But while her head told her she was happy, her heart reminded her constantly of what she really wanted - Brothers by Blood President, Optimus. He was a brooding asshole who was sexy, loyal and pushed the boundaries of both her body and her mind. He never let her all the way in, but she still couldn't stay away from him.</p> <p>Optimus had only one rule - family comes first. He knew that sometimes sacrifices needed to be made in order to keep the ones he loved safe. His feelings for Chelsea were off the charts, but so far he'd managed to hide them and keep her at an arm's length thinking he was protecting her. Beautiful, athletic and sassy, she wasn't just another club girl, she was his girl.</p> <p>Danger is fast approaching and Chelsea is in its direct sight. When secrets are revealed will Chelsea stay and stand beside the man she wants or will the urge to run just be too strong?</p> <p><b>Contains mature themes.</b></p>";
