window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I never thought my life would take a turn into the world of murder mysteries, but here I am, Ophelia Pane, vampire veterinarian extraordinaire, caught in the middle of a deadly game of cat and mouse... or should I say parrot and vampire? As I struggle to juggle my overflowing clinic of fur babies and mythical creatures, a simple house call to check in on a chatty parrot named Elvis turns into a nightmare when I stumble upon his owner’s lifeless body. I must be cursed with bad timing and paranormal shenanigans, because while I’m still frozen in shock, Detective Ryder Wolff shows up at the crime scene… and suddenly I’m a prime murder suspect. Deciding I better uncover the truth if I want to avoid ending up in an orange jumpsuit, I team up with a big-hearted pixie, a troll with a knack for numbers, and a chatty parrot who just doesn’t know when to shut up. Things take a dangerous turn, and it isn’t long before the killer is breathing down my neck. Yes, I know breathing down necks is kind of a vampire’s main gig… but let’s be real, it’s downright creepy.</p> <p></p> <p>As the bodies start piling up and the stakes get higher, I can’t help but wonder if I’ll be able to crack the case before it’s too late. This is a clean paranormal cozy mystery series with a side of humor, that features a vampire veterinarian who stumbles into trouble while trying to take care of her patients... those of the normal and the supernatural variety.</p>";
