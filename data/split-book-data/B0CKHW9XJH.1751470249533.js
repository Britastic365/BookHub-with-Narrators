window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Grayson</b></p> <p>Seven years ago, I left the special forces and my home after a tragic betrayal. I carefully constructed a new life in New York. I thought I had it all. A world-famous boxing trainer by day. A mafia hit man by night. Free to live in the darkness to do what I was trained to do. To kill. I finally felt free.</p> <p>But one kiss was all it took to shatter life as I knew it. The one woman who hated my guts scaled the walls I built around my black heart. My ray of sunshine.</p> <p>Just when I believed I could have it all, life blows it up right before my eyes. I know how far I’m willing to go to fight for her. But can she truly love someone who could never give her the fairy tale she so desperately craves?</p> <p><b>Maddie</b></p> <p>I was sick of being the family disappointment. The one who could never get a man to stick around. So I kissed a lot of frogs to try to find my prince. Instead, I fell in love with the villain. The last man on earth I thought I could ever love.</p> <p>He might call me sunshine, but I crave his darkness. I wasn’t meant for his world, but he took me anyway, and I never wanted to leave. Sometimes, life doesn’t give you a choice. Can I give up on my search when I have the monster offering me the world? Even if loving me puts us both in danger.</p>";
