window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>As the mechanic for Blackbridge Security, when I make a mistake, things don’t work properly. Correcting that mistake is the only way to get things operational. I meet issues in my personal life with the same mindset. How was I to know the woman I’ve been flirting with at the gym is the same woman I called a noise complaint on? I got her kicked out of her condo. My first response: Move in with me. When she confessed to having three kids, it was too late to back down. I thought keeping my hands off of her was going to be a problem, but the tiny terrors she brought along with her are extremely effective at solving that problem for me.</p>";
