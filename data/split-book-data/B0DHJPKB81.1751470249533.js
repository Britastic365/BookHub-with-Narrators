window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When you dance with death, you have to be willing to roll the bones . . .</p> <p>Raven BoneTalker, also known as the Daughter of Bones, is one of the Ante-Fae-the dangerous, unpredictable predecessors to the Fae Races. But Raven is young, and she likes interacting with mortals, so she's opened a business-the Witching Hour-where she takes on clients with ghostly problems. Mostly she reads cards, boots out the odd poltergeist, or helps grieving families contact their loved ones for closure.</p> <p>But when Lana, one of her friends, comes begging for help, things take a dark turn. Raven investigates what seems like a simple haunting on the surface. But the more she delves into the case, the more she realizes that this is no simple ghost. As Raven untangles a web of secrets and deceits kept for over fifty years, she finds herself in danger, facing not only a ghostly threat, but also a danger that is very much alive.</p>";
