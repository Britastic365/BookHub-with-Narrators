If they can do so, they will inherit a million pounds.<br>So, they start talking. But it's complicated. Not everything is as it seems. More clues arrive, but they struggle to piece them together.<br>Can they get to know one another well enough to make the connections? And what of the missing Gower family? Can they be found?<br><br><br>Then there's <b>The St Lucia Mystery</b>... in which Mary Brown heads to the beautiful island of St Lucia on the holiday of a lifetime. She’s planning to relax and take things easy. But on the second evening, while walking on the beach, she finds a purse buried in the sand.<br>Inside it is a folded map, a key, and an invitation to a party on a boat the next evening. There’s also an identity card for someone called Cara Jeffries. And...thousands and thousands of dollars.<br>The wallet does not have a phone number, so Mary heads to the boat party the next night to hand the purse back to its owner.<br>But when she asks whether Cara is there, there is a stunned silence. Everyone on the boat stops and looks.<br>Mary is told that Cara has disappeared.
