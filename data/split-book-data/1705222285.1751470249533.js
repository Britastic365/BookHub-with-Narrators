Her newly discovered abilities may have saved her but they condemn her at the same time. </p> <p>Disguised as a boy, she travels to the home of Lord Ashbourne to find her one and only friend. To maintain her disguise and put a roof over her head, Pippa accepts a job as page of the wardrobe to Ash, a man as mysterious as he is dangerous. If he discovers her lie, he'll send her back to her uncle and her witchcraft will be exposed to the authorities. </p> <p>As the lies build it gets harder for Pippa to maintain her disguise, especially when she falls in love with the man she must serve. </p> <p>Her only hope is to find her friend. But when the friend is murdered, Ash investigates and where he goes, his page goes too. Together they uncover a web of secrets that could destroy Ash and condemn Pippa. But that's nothing compared to what happens when he discovers she's a woman....</p>";
