window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I thought I’d faced the worst.</p> <p>Blackmailed and claimed before the whole academy, the Kingsman pack stole me from my mates and kept my scent for themselves. Now, struggling to fit in in class, I only have one friend, and I’m forced to watch, every day, as my mates fall for her.</p> <p>But these alphas’ obsessions sink their claws deep, blurring right from wrong. Dusk, Umbra, and Ransom are flipping the script, and it’s making me wonder the impossible: Did they steal me from my dreams after all?</p> <p>They built me a nest, and crave my scent—a poison that turns most alphas violent—and somehow balance amidst my twisted, broken instincts. It’s everything I was told I could never have—not without my mates.</p> <p>Now, I have an impossible choice: Dusk is wounded and I am free. I can run to my mates at last.</p> <p>Only, I’m torn.</p> <p>Is this cage a prison at all—or safety from darker threats than I’ve faced before?</p> <p>This book is a MFMM why choose, with dark themes between love interests unlike other PoisonVerse books. This is part two of a trilogy that exists in the larger PoisonVerse Universe.</p>";
