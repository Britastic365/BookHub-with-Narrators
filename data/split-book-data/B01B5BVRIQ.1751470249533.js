window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Which is stronger: blood ties or a battle-tested friendship? That's the question Gin Blanco asks when a friend's long-lost relative strolls into town. The suspicious reunion is a surprise for everyone - and a big problem for Gin. </p><p>Book 14 in the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling urban fantasy series <i>RT Book Reviews</i> calls \"unbeatable entertainment\"! </p><p>It's not easy being queen bee of an underworld abuzz with crooks and killers. Wielding my potent Ice and Stone elemental magic will get me only so far - my real secret is my tight-knit makeshift family, a motley crew of cops and criminals, dwarves, and playboys. My foster brother, Finnegan Lane, is my right-hand man, but when his suddenly not-dead relative comes back into the picture, I'm the one on the outside looking in. </p><p>It's funny how life works: One minute your best friend is rock steady, and the next he's doe eyed and buying in to this whole loving-relative routine to the point of ignoring you. I'd like to be happy for Finn, I really would. But all of my instincts are telling me that beneath the syrupy-sweet demeanor and old-fashioned charm, this sudden interloper is planning something. The whole shtick leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. This person might have avoided the grave once, but I'll put anyone who hurts Finn in the ground - for good. </p>";
