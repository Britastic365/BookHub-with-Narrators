I'm baffled but I'm not saying no.</p> <p>I should also say no to the romantic, suave, brilliant team doctor, Michael Hughes.</p> <p>And the teams new hot-shot all-star player Crew McNeill.</p> <p>But I don't.</p> <p>And I'm loving every minute. Especially the minutes they decide we should all spend together. Golden Retriever Crew is all in, bossy, broody Nathan is reluctant (to say the least), and sexy, confident Michael knows what we all need.
