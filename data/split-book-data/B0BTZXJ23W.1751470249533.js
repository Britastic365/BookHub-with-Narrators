I had been in love with her before…before everything changed what we could be.</p> <p>Undeniably connected and effortlessly infatuated, the two of us had remained each other’s weaknesses through everything. I couldn’t afford to allow her to be my weakness anymore. I was in love with someone else. I was engaged. But it didn’t matter how much time had passed, the moment I saw her again, I knew I would never escape her.</p> <p>I never should have touched her again. Whispering her name in the dark was a mistake. She was still everything I wanted and nothing I should have had.</p> <p>We became a secret that neither of us could keep...a devastating secret that would destroy everything.</p>";
