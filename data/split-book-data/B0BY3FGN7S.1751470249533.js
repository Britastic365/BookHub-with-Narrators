Emma will do anything to save her friend from whatever torture Dr. Thaddeus Kirkbride is putting her through in the Arnsmouth Asylum. Even if Emma—and her trusty fire poker—can manage to free Gigi, she’ll still have to avoid the clutches of the Idol.</p> <p>That's to say nothing about the Church or the man she loves, who is incrementally losing himself to the eldritch horror taking over his body.</p> <p>Nowhere is safe. No one is safe. Not Gigi, not Rafe, and certainly not Emma herself.</p> <p>Between the Dark Societies, the Church, and her increasingly complicated love life, Emma finds herself surrounded by shadows at every turn. She'll be lucky if getting eaten alive by Rafe and his new friends is the worst thing that happens to her. The other outcomes might end the world...and the clock is ticking.</p> <p><i>Of Grave &amp; Glory</i> is the last installment of Tenebris, an occult horror romance series from <i>USA Today</i> bestselling author Kathryn Ann Kingsley.</p> <p>It contains strong themes of madness and murder but guarantees an HEA.
