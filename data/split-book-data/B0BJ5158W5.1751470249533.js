window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>“Happily Ever After” is a total scam, but at least this time the princess is the one controlling the grift—until her true love arrives and threatens to ruin the whole scheme. Intrigue, magic, and wit abound in this Cinderella fairytale reimagining, perfect for fans of Heather Walter and Naomi Novik. </b></p> <p><b>“A dazzlingly magical, thrilling, and inventive take on a beloved classic.”—Lana Harper, </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author of </b><b><i>Payback's a Witch</i></b></p> <p>I’m not who you think I am.</p> <p>My transformation from a poor, orphaned scullery maid into the enchantingly mysterious lady who snagged the heart of the prince did not happen—as the rumors insisted—in a magical metamorphosis of pumpkins and glass slippers. On the first evening of the ball, I didn’t meekly help my “evil” stepmother and stepsisters primp and preen or watch forlornly out the window as their carriage rolled off toward the palace. I had other preparations to make.</p> <p>My stepsisters and I had been trained for this—to be the cleverest in the room, to be quick with our hands and quicker with our lies. We were taught how to get everything we wanted in this world, everything men always kept for themselves: power, wealth, and prestige. And with a touchingly tragic past and the help of some highly illegal spells, I would become a princess, secure our fortunes, and we would all live happily ever after.</p> <p>But there’s always more to the story. With my magic running out, war looming, and a handsome hostage prince—the <i>wrong </i>prince—distracting me from my true purpose with his magnetic charm and forbidden flirtations, I’m in danger of losing control of the delicate balance I’ve created . . . and that could prove fatal.</p> <p>There’s so much more riding on this than a crown.</p>";
