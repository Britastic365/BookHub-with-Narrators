window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>As the heir to a powerful vampire gang, I should be a master thief by now.</b></p> <p>But my abilities have always been flawed. I'm good at one thing, though—stealing. When my uncle sets his sights on a prized possession owned by Gothel, the ruler of the Sky Syndicate, I'm tasked with the job of taking it.</p> <p>Everything changes when I meet the captivating gargoyle. He offers to fix my broken magic, and his smoldering touch and commanding presence make me feel alive for the first time in years.</p> <p>But Gothel's help comes with a cost. He demands my complete surrender. And when I discover just how good it feels to give in, it's a price I'm willing to pay. Our dangerous game of seduction and submission leaves me yearning for more. Even as I give myself to him, I know the bliss is short-lived. I'll learn from Gothel, and then I'll steal from him.</p> <p>At least, that's what I tell myself. The more time I spend in the syndicate lord's company—and over his knee—the more I wonder if I can rob the only male who's ever truly helped me.</p> <p>When danger threatens to keep us apart for good, I realize I haven't been learning to steal. I've been learning to love… and I'll do whatever it takes to win Gothel's heart, even if it means risking everything.</p>";
