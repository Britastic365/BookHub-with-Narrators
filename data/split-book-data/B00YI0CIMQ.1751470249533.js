window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When ex-Special Ops bad-ass Mace walks into Needle's Kiss tattoo parlor, he never expects to find the girl who would turn his life upside down. Hard-as-nails Scarlett has been unlucky in love: She's been burnt, chewed up, and spat out. Reluctant to have another relationship, can she keep her wits about her when hot-as-sin Mace walks into her tattoo parlor? Or will he break her down and leave his mark within her ink? </p><p>What starts out as a little fun turns into something so much more. Can Scarlett look beyond Mace's devastating past, or will his demons come back to haunt them both? </p><p>Content warning: contains steamy, anywhere-goes sex; an alcohol-induced embarrassing night out; and two headstrong lovers taken on a whirlwind of crazy. </p>";
