I took her because I had no other choice, but as I carried her from her home dripping wet and wearing nothing but a towel, I knew I would be keeping her.</p> <p>I'm going to make her tell me everything I need to know. Then, I'm going to make her mine.</p> <p>She'll sob as my belt lashes her bottom, and she'll scream as climax after savage climax is forced from her naked, quivering body, but there will be no mercy, no matter how shamefully she begs.</p> <p>She's not just going to learn to obey me. She's going to learn to fear me.</p> <p><b>Publisher's note:</b> <i>Fear</i> includes spankings, rough sexual scenes, intense and humiliating punishments, and strong D/s themes. If such material offends you, please don't buy this book.</p>";
