window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An epic romantic fantasy from the hugely popular author of The Female series in which a young woman must sneak into the faerie realm to recover a priceless plant, only to find herself in the middle of a war.</b></p> <p>Abby has come up with a brilliant plan. Sneak into the faerie realm, travel to the shifter forest, and collect all the delysum she can get her hands on, and return home before anybody discovers who she is. Simple. At least that’s what she tells herself.</p> <p>The only problem is she’s never actually been to the faerie realm, and once she gets there, it turns out the few stories she’s been told about it have been wildly deceiving. The plant she’s meant to collect is being cultivated into a weapon, and the faeries are on the cusp of war with the shifters.</p> <p>Suddenly Abby finds herself caught in the middle of a deadly war between the fae and the shifters, with only her wits to keep her enemies at bay. Captured in the forest by the faerie and shifter princes, Abby must find a way to escape and return home before they figure out who she really is. And realize that there’s nothing more dangerous than a spy...</p> <p>This fae romantic fantasy is perfect for fans of Jeneane O’Riley’s Infatuated Fae series and Penn Cole’s <i>Spark of the Everflame</i>!</p>";
