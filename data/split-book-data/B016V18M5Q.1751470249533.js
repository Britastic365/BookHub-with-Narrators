window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Everyone knows Brooke Wicks loves to have a good time. She’s not interested in getting serious, settling down, or limiting herself to one man. So when she meets the sexy, irresistible Mason King, she sees another opportunity to let loose and go wild. But the gorgeous Aussie isn’t interested in just a quick fling with Brooke, and if she wants to get into his bed, she’s going to have to do it on his terms. </p><p>Loving fast and hard has always been Mason’s philosophy. He doesn’t want a meaningless connection; he wants it all, and he wants it with Brooke. When she makes her one desire known - to hit it and quit it - Mason wages a plan to ensure Brooke keeps coming back for more. Or so he hopes. Getting her attention was the easy part. Keeping it might be damn near impossible. </p>";
