She fell in love with a fa√ßade, and now she's desperate to free herself before it's too late. When opportunity arises, she takes it, even though being found would surely bring her a death sentence. Armed with a new identity and half a million dollars in stolen drug money, she disappears to start a new life for herself. For six years, she's had the freedom she craved, but that is all about to change when he is on her trail.</p> <p>Ahmad \"Play\" Pryor isn't a man of many words. After years of living the street life, all he wants is peace. When his brother Ashton, a private investigator, comes to him with a proposition, Ahmad is hesitant.

From the moment he lays eyes on the beautiful Lila Peterson, formally known as Nala Stanton, he is enthralled beyond his wildest dreams.</p> <p>With Lila in his possession, his main goal is to return her to the very man she ran from all those years ago. For Ahmad, it becomes harder than ever to just do his job. What begins as a captor/kidnapper relationship, soon turns into something neither of them imagined or could have ever prepared themselves for. When forbidden feelings arise and tension grows from all sides, Ahmad and Lila find themselves in a bit of a tight space.</p> <p>Will Ahmad complete the job he's been paid to do, or will he keep this beautiful hostage all for himself?</p>";
