window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Temptation has never been so dangerous.</b></p> <p>A domineering force in Miami’s volatile criminal underworld, Brad Black is respected. Feared. His deadly accurate trigger finger and indestructible persona has earned him his intimidating reputation and, up until six months ago, hookers, drugs, and protecting the Black empire was the sum of his life’s purpose.</p> <p>Until he saved her.</p> <p>Wild, brave, and beautiful, Pearl Kennedy is Brad’s kryptonite. A distraction. A young distraction. But with enemies joining forces, coming at them with more force and less mercy than ever before, she’s also a deadly distraction. Focusing on the end game, finding and killing their enemies, has to remain his priority.</p> <p>But Brad completely underestimates the power of his connection with Pearl. And he can’t shake the niggling feeling that there’s more to her than meets the eye.</p> <p>Pearl Kennedy was saved from the clutches of human traffickers by one of the world’s most notorious criminals—Brad Black. Since being taken back to his family’s mansion in Miami, she’s felt safe and protected, despite Brad’s cold, brusque, and confusing treatment. He should disgust her—he’s flaunted his hedonistic tastes unapologetically.</p> <p>But no matter how hard Pearl tries to fight it, she’s drawn to the lethal, handsome killer. Yet she knows she’s living on borrowed time, and to succumb to the attraction would be to expose herself and her secrets. And then it will be just a matter of who will kill her first. The monsters from her past. Or Brad Black.</p>";
