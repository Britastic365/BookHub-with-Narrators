window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Contains all four books in the Curse of the Cyren Queen dark fantasy quartet plus three bonus stories.</b></p> <p><b><i>A Lair of Bones,</i></b><b> book one:</b></p> <p>A deadly contest. A vaulting ambition. How far will one cyren go to win?</p> <p>Mighty cyrens have ruled the ancient lair of Saddoriel for centuries. A cavernous fortress, a subterranean labyrinth of tunnels and levels, powered by magic and music…</p> <p>From the moment she was born, Roh, the daughter of an infamous criminal, has been despised by her own kind. Restricted to the lower sector and forced to work as a common bone cleaner, she has always believed she belongs above, where lies adventure… and power.</p> <p>Opportunity arises in the form of the Queen's Tournament, a treacherous set of trials that could see the victor crowned ruler of the entire lair. Up against the most cunning, dangerous cyrens in all the realms, does Roh stand a chance?</p> <p><b><i>With Dagger and Song,</i></b><b> book two:</b></p> <p>An empty crown. A perilous journey. Will she answer when darkness calls?</p> <p>Against all odds, Roh survived the harrowing Queen's Tournament, but now something far deadlier awaits her: a formidable quest for the three magic birthstones of Saddoriel. The gems have been scattered across the realms—and only when Roh retrieves them can she take her place as queen. But surrounded by hostile companions and tormented by the dangerous secret she carries, Roh begins to realize that the pursuit of power may prove more destructive than she ever imagined.</p> <p>Nothing can prepare her for the nightmares that fester in the shadows of Akoris, a fanatical cyren territory, or the twisted games of its cunning leader... Can Roh win the first birthstone without sacrificing everything she holds dear—and without losing herself?</p> <p><b><i>The Fabric of Chaos,</i></b><b> book three:</b></p> <p>An almighty power. A deadly choice. Will she come undone when chaos reigns?</p> <p>After facing heartbreaking betrayals and jaw-dropping revelations in Akoris, Roh must steel herself once more and continue her quest to win the cyren throne.</p> <p>But with poison lingering in her body and a new, unpredictable companion at her side, the trek to the mysterious territory of Csilla becomes all the more perilous. Dangerous schemes are afoot, ones that threaten not only the homeland Roh intends to rule but all of cyrenkind.</p> <p>As her journey stretches across the realm, Roh must navigate the dark web of her own ambition and master her newfound magic.</p> <p>Will she triumph against the trials ahead—or sow the seeds of her own destruction?</p> <p><b><i>To Wield a Crown,</i></b><b> book four:</b></p> <p>A final quest. A people divided. Can one cyren turn the tides of fate?</p> <p>The time has come to obtain the final birthstone of Saddoriel. Reeling from a near-deadly sacrifice, Roh must rally all her strength if she is to take her place on the throne.</p> <p>But with cyrenkind divided and enemies closing in, the road to Lochloria and beyond is more dangerous than ever. An ancient prophecy looms, loyalties are tested, and Roh races against the clock that threatens to undo all she's fought for.</p> <p>As a centuries-long conflict comes to a head and forces of nature collide, Roh has to decide if there is more than one kind of magic in this world and whether or not she has the power to harness it.</p> <p>Some bonds will solidify, while others will be fractured forever—but all must take up their swords and face the final battle for a better Saddoriel.</p> <p>Will Roh emerge from the perils victorious, or will the trials claim her at last?</p> <p><i>Includes bonus stories, \"The Law of the Lair,\" \"The Tides of War,\" and \"A Song in the Deep.\"</i></p>";
