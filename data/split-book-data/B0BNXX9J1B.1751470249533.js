window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>“With the final ascension, she will be complete. Dark, Light, Justice, and Balance to join together with Blood as one….” <br> <br> The Balance has been irrevocably altered, and I’ve found myself in the clutches of a blood mage. One that I find myself drawn to in more ways than one. I didn’t think it possible. Another mate? I could barely handle the three I already had. <br> <br> Our bond circle is tested as the true enemy emerges from the shadows. We must fight together as one or we will all fall.</p> <p>The fate of the world lies in my hands. Alone, I’m not powerful enough to save it. Can I depend on my mates to get along and join together to fight against the evil threatening us? <br> <br> Dark. Light. Justice. Blood. My mates surround me, and I must trust them if I am to survive this battle. <br> <br> For together we are strong. <br> Divided we will fall. <br> <br> Am I strong enough to keep my mates together and fight the balance at the same time, or will the realms be thrown into chaos? <br> <br> <i>Balance Altered</i> is a why-choose romance that contains content for mature audiences only. It will have MM and group sexual situations, action, fighting, and a seriously sarcastic angel. You have been warned. </p>";
