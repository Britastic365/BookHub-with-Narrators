The next, I’m transported to another planet with sweeping red dunes, crimson mountains, and pastel wildlife that make me question if my champagne was laced.</p> <p>Every time I babbled to the night sky on my wobbly rooftop lounger, I didn’t actually think someone else, in a far-off galaxy, might be doing the same thing. Turns out, I was wrong. Reon, my new alien immigration lawyer, looks like Space Satan with his horns that heat with his moods, his glowing sigils, and the bizarre shards of his personality that physically manifest.</p> <p>The moment I believe I’m stranded and never going back to Earth, Reon makes me an offer I can’t refuse. Can I strike a bargain with the devil without losing my heart?</p>";
