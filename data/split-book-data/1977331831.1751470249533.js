window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>To get a fresh start away from a bad relationship, Kylie Strange moves across the country to open a shop in a seemingly quiet town in rural Maine. During renovations on Strange Herbs &amp; Teas, she discovers a peculiar and ancient codex, <i>The Booke of the Hidden</i>, bricked into the wall. Every small town has its legends and unusual histories, and this artifact sends Kylie right into the center of Moody Bog's biggest secret. </p> <p>While puzzling over the tome's oddly blank pages, Kylie gets an unexpected visitor - Erasmus Dark, an inscrutable stranger who claims to be a demon, knows she has the book, and warns her that she has opened a portal to the netherworld. Kylie brushes off this nonsense, until a series of bizarre murders put her, the newcomer, at the center. With the help of the demon and a coven of witches she befriends while dodging the handsome but sharp-eyed sheriff, Kylie hunts for a killer - that might not be human.</p> <p><i>Contains mature themes.</i></p>";
