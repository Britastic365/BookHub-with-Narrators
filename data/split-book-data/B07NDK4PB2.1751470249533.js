window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A day in the life of the Devil should be exhilarating - lying, stealing, cheating at poker, and finally beating Mr. Rogers.... <br> Life should be wonderful. <br> Right? <br> Wrong. </p> <p>The love of my dastardly immortal life is eating everything that isn't nailed down and tried to behead me over a chocolate croissant. While I take chocolate croissants very seriously, I do believe decapitation is somewhat harsh. </p> <p>My daughters, the Seven Deadly Sins, are driving me to drink. Getting them mated off and the hell out of Hell is at the top on my agenda. </p> <p>The one thing that is keeping me sane - sane being a relative word - is my upcoming special day. After living a millennium and never knowing the date I came to be, I have sussed out the information from my certifiably insane, pole-dancing mother. She's swears on her empty head that my birthday is April 1. </p> <p>Soon, April 1 will mean something. I'm no fool. I plan to make my birthday far more famous than my do-gooder nephew's. That day in December will be forgotten when I get done making my womb eviction day the most important in the history of the Universe. </p> <p>I shall simply go about business as usual. Punishments must be doled out and chaos must be encouraged. A vacation would be lovely, but there is no rest for the weary...or the evil. Luckily I know how to have an outstanding time doing outrageously bad things. </p> <p>Thank Hades, I'm a handsome bastard. </p> <p>Oh, and happy birthday to me.</p>";
