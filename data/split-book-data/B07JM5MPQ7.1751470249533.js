window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>I never wanted a mate. Until I was put in chains. Strapped down. And claimed. </i></p> <p>I always believed I could analyze any situation until I found a solution. Solve any problem if I just applied my brain. I went to university, studied science, and told myself my academic cocoon would protect me from the alphas dominating our society. </p> <p>I was wrong.</p> <p>No textbook prepared me for my meeting with test subject 351. The biggest, scariest alpha on death row hauled into my lab to uncover how to control the beast of a man. How to make him submit. Mold him into a weapon. But there is no controlling the feral alpha, and no logic strong enough to save my mind once he unleashes his fury on my body.</p> <p>Once he claims me.</p> <p><i>Obsession</i> is the first book in Nora Ash’s second suspense-filled Omegaverse serial, <i>Feral</i>. </p> <p><i>Please note: </i>This series gets dark, and it gets <i>dirty.</i> If you don’t enjoy your romance scorching and your alphas rough and dominant, give this book a pass.</p>";
