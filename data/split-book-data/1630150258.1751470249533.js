window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Henry Wolf is a deliciously wicked, sinfully handsome man who has done a very bad thing. Potentially. </p> <p>Worse, he owns me now - every inch of my body and a sizeable chunk of my stupid, na√Øve heart. And he's made it clear that if I want to keep my job and stay in Alaska, I'm stuck catering to his every whim and wish - both in the hotel and in his bedroom - while I wait for the potential fiery media circus ring that will no doubt drag my reputation into the gutter along with his, should his past discretions surface. </p> <p>I will not surrender to his demands, not when I have dirt to hold over his head. If I have the guts to blackmail him, that is. Something warns me that going through with it will have disastrous consequences for my heart. </p> <p><b><i>Contains mature themes.</i></b></p>";
