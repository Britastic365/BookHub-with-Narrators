window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Nora knows she needs to move on. And forget about magic. </p> <p>She's back in graduate school, and her life is going surprisingly well. She doesn't need to think about other worlds, about enchantments and demons, or about magicians - even though she once aspired to become one herself. Most of all, she really should forget the magician Aruendiel, who shared the secrets of magic with her but fiercely guarded the deepest secrets of his heart. </p> <p>Then a chance encounter gives Nora the opportunity to slip between worlds again - and the next phase of her magical education begins. </p> <p>Her reunion with Aruendiel, so eagerly sought, triggers catastrophe. Alone and injured in a hostile land, Nora finds a new ally and accepts her first real job as a magician. Just as she's hitting her stride in this new role, however, Nora discovers that her intoxicating new power has a higher price than she anticipated. </p> <p>Trying to distinguish between friend and enemy, truth and falsehood, Nora can take nothing for granted. It will take more than even the most powerful of discernment spells to help her and Aruendiel see clearly in a dark fog of illusions and lies. And finding her way to the truth could cost Nora her life....</p>";
