window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In this village, I’m an outcast: Griffin Everett, the scowling giant who prefers plants to people. Then I meet Keynes, a stranger from the city who’s everything I’m not: sharp-tongued, sophisticated, beautiful. Free. For a few precious moments in a dark alleyway, he’s also mine, hot and sweet under the stars...until he crushes me like dirt beneath his designer boot.</p> <p>When the prettiest man I’ve ever hated shows up at my job the next day, I’m not sure if I want to strangle him or drag him into bed. Actually - I think I want both. But Keynes isn’t here for the likes of me: He makes that painfully clear. With everyone else at work, he’s all gorgeous, glittering charm - but when I get too close, he turns vicious.</p> <p>And yet, I can’t stay away. Because there’s something about this ice king that sets me on fire, a secret vulnerability that makes my chest ache. I’ll do whatever it takes to sneak past his walls and see the real man again.</p> <p>The last thing I expect is for that man to ruin me.</p>";
