window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Katy knows that the world changed the night the Luxen came. She can't believe that Daemon welcomed his race or stood by as his kind threatened to obliterate every last human and hybrid on Earth. But the lines between good and bad have blurred, and love has become an emotion that could destroy her-could destroy them all. </p> <p>Daemon will do anything to save those he loves, even if it means betrayal. He and Katy must team up with an unlikely enemy if there is any chance of surviving the invasion. But when it quickly becomes impossible to tell friend from foe and the world begins to crumble around them, they may have to sacrifice everything-even what they cherish most-to ensure the survival of their friends . . . and mankind.</p>";
