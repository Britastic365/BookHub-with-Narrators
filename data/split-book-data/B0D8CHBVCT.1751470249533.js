He wants to get to know the vivacious beauty better, but his plan was to wine and dine her, not scrutinize every aspect of her life. If she’s the spy they’re hunting, then his life just got more complicated, and his heart might never recover.</p> <p>She hates secrets—but she’s keeping a big one.</p> <p>Bobbi is on a classified mission to learn who is spying for the enemy, and she’s running out of time. If she fails? It’s just the stability of the galaxy that’s at stake—no pressure.</p> <p>She’s not the only one after the spy. Nova Force’s best are on the case, too, including Kurt.

When the enemy strikes, Bobbi and Kurt are thrown together on a mission only one of them is trained for, and a romance neither one of them expected…</p>";
