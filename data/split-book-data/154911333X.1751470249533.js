window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Discover a new series from the author of the number-one <i>New York Times</i> best-seller <i>Beautiful Disaster</i>: a \"[H]eartbreaking and hopeful, raw and sexy\" tale about a woman on the run who encounters a stranger with a secret (Lauren Blakely, author of <i>Part-Time Lover</i>). </p> <p>As Darby Dixon sits in a tiny Texas church bathroom on her wedding day holding a positive pregnancy test, she realizes marrying her fiancé would be the worst decision of her life. She's never been very good at standing up for herself, but she'll sure as hell stand up for her baby. With very little cash and a ton of courage, she flees town to take a new name and start a new life.</p> <p>As a Marine, Scott \"Trex\" Trexler worked in the most treacherous, corrupt, war-torn places on earth. With his new top-secret security job, he finally has a chance to return to the one place he's felt at peace: Colorado Springs, Colorado.</p> <p>The moment Trex checks in at the hotel where she's working, Darby knows he's dangerous. He may want her to think he's another hotshot firefighter, along with all the others battling the nearby mountain blaze, but something doesn't add up. No way will she get involved with another man she can't fully trust - and Trex clearly isn't telling her everything. As Darby's ex gets closer and closer to finding her, both she and Trex will soon find out that what you don't know can hurt you.</p> <p>\"Jamie McGuire writes with no holds barred.... [R]eal and addictive.\" (<i>USA Today</i>)</p>";
