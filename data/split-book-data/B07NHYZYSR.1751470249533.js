But what he demands in exchange for answers will thrust Daphne into a world of mystery, hatred, and lust.</p> <p><i>An indecent proposal…</i></p> <p>Thirty days and nights in the bed of the Earl of Hartmoor...this is the price she must pay to learn the truth of the dark lord’s vendetta against her family. Yet, when she accepts the offer, Daphne never expects to find that nothing is what she thought it was, and the truth proves far harder to stomach than she ever imagined. </p> <p><b><i>Book 2: The Dove</i></b></p> <p><i>An unexpected obsession…</i></p> <p>After 30 days and nights in his bed, Adam sends Daphne back to London a fallen woman, the final blow that will see the Fairchild family scorned by society. However, he is hard-pressed to forget the beauty of her submission, or the brief moments of peace and balance she brought his tortured existence. Despite the bad blood between their families, he is determined to possess her, to stake his claim on her beyond the 30 nights she gave him. She will fight him at every turn … which will only make the chase, and her inevitable surrender, all the better.</p> <p><i>A choice between love and retribution…</i></p> <p>When the consequences of Adam’s deeds begin to fall back on not only him, but Daphne, as well, he is forced to bring her under his protection. He will end this feud between his family and hers once and for all, and is determined to put her behind him when all is said and done. Yet, it becomes increasingly clear that setting her aside will not be as simple as he thought. Her heart could be his for the taking, but only if he will abandon his vendetta against her family once and for all. Will Adam choose a lifetime of peace and love with Daphne … or will the need for revenge consume him, and eventually, destroy him? </p>";
