window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Delilah Gordon has a secret. She's been in love with her best friend and the boy next door, Fox Nelson, since she was six years old. And while most of her friends and family know about her unrequited crush, the one person who remains oblivious is Fox himself. To Delilah, it's better this way. She'd rather pretend that they're just friends, even though her feelings for the moody, rugged mountain man are anything but tame. </p> <p>Fox Nelson has a secret too. As a wildland firefighter or \"hot shot,\" Fox heads into danger every day he's on the job, risking all to fight wildfires that threaten ranches, forests, and thousands of lives. But while Fox's job is only for the brave, inside he feels anything but. The more he grapples with his raging demons, the more he realizes Delilah is the only one who can put out the flames. As the two friends grow closer - and more intimate - than ever before, the more complicated their relationship becomes. And Delilah has one more secret to reveal. A secret that will change both their lives... forever. Contains mature themes.</p>";
