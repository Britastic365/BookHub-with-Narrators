window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Ash London, front man for uber-successful rock band Ferrum, is over the lifestyle. He's done with it all, yet finds himself going through the motions out of a sense of obligation to his fans, band, and crew members. He's living the dream, but what he wants is to be a normal dude with an ordinary life far away from the touring scene. He could have any woman he wanted, but what he wants is someone who can look past the rock star; someone who will bust down the walls he's built around himself and break free the man lying dormant within. </p> <p>Lila Stephens hasn't had the best past. In fact, it has been downright traumatic. After the death of her beloved grandmother, she picks up her life and moves to Brooklyn, NY to build a new life for herself. She's given up on the notion of love and is content living alone with her Beagle. </p> <p>Lila attends a party thrown by her best friend, Tori, who just happens to be the wife of Ferrum guitarist Matty Tabor. As she's ready to leave, a drunken man runs into her, sending her falling into the arms of Ash London. Will she stay there where it's warm and comforting, or will she flee as her past threatens to taint any hope of happiness for the two of them? </p>";
