window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A science fiction mystery set in the India of the future by two-time Hugo Award winner Elizabeth Bear.</b></p> <p>A man has been turned inside-out. Literally.</p> <p>Fifty years hence, in the sleek modern city of Bangalore, a scientist working on revolutionary bioengineering techniques has been discovered inside his own locked home, his body converted into a neat toroidal package of meat. It's up to Police Sub-Inspector Ferron to unearth the victim's complicated past and solve the crime, despite the best efforts of the mastermind behind the murder, aliens beaming signals from the Andromeda Galaxy, her overbearing mother, and the intricacies of dealing with the only witness - an adorable parrot-cat.</p>";
