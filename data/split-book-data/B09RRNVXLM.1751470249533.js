Someone who knows what Dom did all those years ago.</p> <p>While Dom juggles Kempthorne's lies and his own shady past, latents are being murdered. The police won't help, so it's up to Dom, Kempthorne, and new recruit Kage (Hollywood) to find the killer, before they strike too close to home.</p> <p>Dom soon finds himself at the heart of it all with his control slipping, his trick breaking free, and the shadows rising.</p> <p>He's coming undone. And for unstable latents, there's only one way out.... </p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
