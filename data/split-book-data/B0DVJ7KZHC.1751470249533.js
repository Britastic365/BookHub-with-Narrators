The cold steel of a barrel</i>. <i>And, the idea that one shot could end life as quickly as it had begun</i>.</p> <p><b>My father had cursed me</b> before I left the womb. <i>Ruger</i>–after his favorite gun, he’d tried naming me. But, my mother had other plans. He foresaw a future for me <b>drawn with gunpowder,</b> interchangeable like custom grips, self-sufficient like automatics, and <i>lethal like switches.</i></p> <p>I’d <b>given my heart and soul to the soil</b> before I stepped off the porch and conquered my first kill.
