window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>I'll do anything to protect what we have, including lying to the Scorned Girls.</b></p> <p>The instant I saw King, I knew he was my scent-matched Alpha, and boy did he drive that point home. The second time I met him was when my bestie, who also happens to be his daughter, introduced us. Yep, that was a plot twist I never saw coming.</p> <p>My Scorned Girls have always said, \"slots before knots,\" but in one night, the friendship we share is changed forever by my need for King. Throw in the fact one of his enemies knows about me, and it's little wonder I stop sharing secrets with the girls. When those threats become physical, I start lying through my teeth.</p> <p>I don't even tell them about Maverick, who scents as good as he fights, or the doctor I accidentally claim. Of course, those Alphas have deadly secrets of their own.</p> <p>I know we're living a dangerous life, but the heart wants what the heart wants—and I want to call those Alphas mine. No matter the distance we try to maintain, our paths keep crossing, and it doesn't take long to see that nothing is going to stop us from packing—not even their Alpha rivalry.</p> <p>What threatens our future isn't telling the Scorned Girls, it's the very reason we've had to keep each other a secret.</p> <p>In the darkness that follows, all I can do is hope they didn't lie when they said we'd be together… because I'm not sure I want to survive, not without them.</p> <p>Knot without You <i>is book three in a series of standalones. Each book follows an Omega wronged by an Alpha, or a few, in her life, and an HEA is guaranteed. For mature listeners.</i></p>";
