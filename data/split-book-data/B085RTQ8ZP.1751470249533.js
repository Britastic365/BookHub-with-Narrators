window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Masen Crisfield fell in love with Booth Jones when she was 16 years old. Booth was the love of her life. The rock she needed to get her through the day. Then, she rips his heart out while he’s deployed, leaving him wondering just what he’d done to warrant something so severe as a breakup that neither of them wanted.</p> <p>Stubbornness is their middle name, and 10 long years pass before either one of them try to breach the gap. </p> <p>Circumstances force Booth to come home, and within an hour of him being back in his home town, there she is. Right back in the forefront of his mind where he knows she shouldn’t be.</p> <p>The day he starts his first civilian job at Kilgore Fire Department, his worst fear of seeing Masen is realized. And not only does he see her, but he sees her with another man. A fellow firefighter that he has to trust with his life.</p> <p>It soon becomes apparent that they are both still just as much in love with each other now as they were the moment they met. But there’s a problem. Booth’s married, and Masen’s in a committed relationship.</p> <p>They fight the pull with everything they have, but they’re both about to learn the true meaning of flash point as their lives crash together, their love consuming everything in it’s path.</p> <p><b>Author's note: </b>There is absolutely no cheating in this book.</p>";
