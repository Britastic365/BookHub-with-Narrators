window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Villains don’t get happily ever afters, do they?</p> <p>I have a glorious past full of achievement and renown. I mean, I feel like I must, right? The problem is, I can’t remember it. I can’t even remember my own name. I was found in a river, body mangled and face scarred, with nothing to identify me besides a single embroidered letter.</p> <p>My memory is a murky blur, but I have a quest, one that will give me back everything I’ve lost. The voice in the water told me so. But the voice seemed to miss a few important highlights—namely the woman who challenges me at every twist and turn of my journey. The woman who tells me I’m a villain. The woman who becomes every fervent whisper of my heart, and every last thought in my head.<br> <br> If I can complete my quest and recover what I’ve lost, she’ll see we’re meant to be.</p> <p><i>Lily's Note</i>: Sometimes falling from a great height can lead to a whole new life. This is a full-length <b>standalone</b> fantasy romance. Let your imagination run wild about who G is and just how wide his evil streak can be (hint: <i>massive</i>.)</p> <p>\"Everyone has a little bit of wickedness inside them…some more than others. And ‘G’, as he is known, a selfish oaf who thinks of no one but himself, is plenty vile. But there is still something about him you just love. Lily Archer did a fantastic job bringing this well-known fairytale villain to life with <b>sarcastic and flirty banter</b>, romance, and plenty of turns and surprises.\" (Tiffany Roberts, <i>USA Today </i>best-selling author)</p>";
