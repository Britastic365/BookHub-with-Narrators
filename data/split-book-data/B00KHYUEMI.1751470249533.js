window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Sammi Miller lives a quiet life as a pub owner in the Scottish Highlands - until the mob bursts in with guns blazing, looking for her ex-lover. Taking a bullet in the shoulder, she manages to escape and make her way to her half-sister Jane. </p> <p>Hidden away in the mountain fortress of the mysterious Dreagan Industries, Sammi finds more than a safe haven. She finds Tristan - the most gorgeous, beguiling, and haunted man she has ever known. Newest of the Dragon Kings, Tristan fell from the sky in a snowstorm naked with a sword - but with no memories of his ancient struggles. When he meets the wounded Sammi, something powerful stirs within his heart. When he sees the dragon symbol etched into the bullet from her shoulder, something fierce burns within his soul. With his darkest enemies closing in, Tristan must take wing, take sides - and take no prisoners - to save the woman he's destined to love. </p>";
