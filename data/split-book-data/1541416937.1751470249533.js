window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Some call him a madman. Others call him a warlock. Both are true.</b></p> <p>But if it wasn't for Aon, I'd be dead. I was mere seconds away from dying by Edu's hands when the King of Shadows appeared in a flash of lightning, saving me from Edu's murderous plans.</p> <p>Now I'm under his protection, living in his home. The more time I'm forced to spend with him, the more I start to piece together the puzzle of why Aon and Edu are at war. Despite how everyone else seems to hate Aon, there's something that pulls me towards him - like gravity, refusing to let go. My heart is telling me to believe what he says is true, yet there's this prickle of warning in the back of my skull cautioning me against falling for the King of Shadows.</p> <p>In the world of Under trusting the wrong person can get you killed. Only the strong survive out here, and that's what I intend to do. </p> <p>Survive.</p>";
