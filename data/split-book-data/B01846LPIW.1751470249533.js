Now...his hair had greyed a little, and his eyes, though still very bright and observant, bore the imprint of many a year spent exploring - and often, I guessed, discovering - along rarely trodden paths of mysterious, obscure learning.\" </p> <p>Mysterious, obscure learning.... </p> <p>To many thousands of listeners world-wide, Titus Crow is the psychic sleuth - the cosmic voyager and investigator - of Brian Lumley's Cthulhu Mythos novels, from <i>The Burrowers Beneath</i> to <i>Elysia</i>. </p> <p>But before The Burrowers and Crow's transition, his exploits were chronicled in a series of short stories and novellas uncollected in the USA, except in limited editions. Now these stories can be told again. From <i>Inception</i>, which tells of Crow's origins, to <i>The Black Recalled</i>, a tale of vengeance from beyond the grave, here in one volume, from the best-selling author of the epic Necroscope series, is <i>The Compleat Crow</i>. </p>";
