window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Two feuding kingdoms. One unbreakable sleeping curse.</p> <p>Princess Aurelia would rather spend her time with her dragons than her court. But when a deadly sleeping curse befalls her family, her only hope lies in the hands of the wicked Prince Fenn. His kingdom maintains the only known supply of stardust, a rare substance that is the key to breaking the spell. But Fenn’s aid comes with a price: Aurelia must pose as his betrothed to secure an alliance that will protect his court.</p> <p>As they embark on their journey, weaving a web of deception, Aurelia begins to see through his charming facade. Beneath his flippant persona lies a depth she never expected—a prince she could grow to care for. Perhaps even love.</p> <p>But as genuine feelings blossom between them, Aurelia stumbles upon a sinister secret within Fenn's court—a secret that threatens not only her dragons and her kingdom, but the very essence of her soul. Can she trust Fenn to save her family, or will his hidden darkness be their undoing?</p> <p><i>Crown of Slumber</i> is a Sleeping Beauty retelling with a twist, full of dark fae magic, deadly court schemes, and steamy romance. The Crowns of the Fae books can be listened to in any order as standalone novels.</p>";
