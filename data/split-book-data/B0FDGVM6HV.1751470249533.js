window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A Dark MM Sci-Fi Mafia Enemies to Lovers Romance </p> <p>A Devil of Vitality always courts chaos. Aneski Kendricks wants to know what happened to his brother. And why he was so brutally tossed aside by the one person who should have stuck by him after Russ’s death. It took three years of hard work climbing the ladder to gain leadership of the Shepard gang, but he's finally in a position to demand answers. Even from the devil himself. Too bad the devil and the man he used to all but worship are one and the same. Aneski's plan has always been to get revenge, and not just for his brother, though that's what he tells his friends. He wants to know what happened to Russ, true, but he also wants to know why he was abandoned. If only revenge was as easy as it sounded. Once he’s got Flix where he wants him, it should be, but Ani’s old emotions keep getting in the way. Will his pent-up desire cost him his last shred of decency? What did it say about him that he could still want the man who possibly murdered his brother?</p> <p>Flix Fulmini is a Runner by trade. As the official Runner/Fixer of the Brumal Mafia, he's got sneaking around and secret-keeping down to an art form. Aneski is just a name on a long list of them he’s withholding information from, and out of all those names, he’s the last person Flix feels threatened by. Which is why it's so shocking when he's kidnapped on Vail University campus and wakes up chained to a wall drenched in ice water. Even more surprising is realizing who his captor is. Three years ago, Flix left Aneski behind, but the guy has been holding a grudge ever since. Not to mention the fact he's convinced Flix has something to do with his brother's death, which he isn't entirely wrong about. Flix has been hiding more than a few things, and for good reason, but when Aneski sinks his claws into him and yanks some of those secrets out, Flix has a tough decision to make. Kill Ani before he can tattle to the Brumal? Or force him to his knees?</p>";
