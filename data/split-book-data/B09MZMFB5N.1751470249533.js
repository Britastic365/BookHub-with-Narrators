window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>An extended epilogue book to conclude Milo and Raven's epic love story.</p> <p><b>Milo: </b></p> <p>Our lives have changed. </p> <p>Our worst moments and biggest secrets are used as leverage against us.</p> <p>People want to force us apart in the name of the greater good.</p> <p>Maybe they’re right; maybe we are each other’s villains, and not heroes.</p> <p>But that doesn’t change anything, because it’s her or no one!</p> <p><b>Raven:</b></p> <p>Our past is catching up with us.</p> <p>Our secrets are out, and our family is falling apart. </p> <p>Seeing my sister follow in my footsteps turns out to be the wake-up call I needed, but definitely didn’t want.</p> <p>For better or worse, family sticks together. </p> <p>But at the end of the day, I’ve made my choice, because it’s him or no one! </p> <p>This is a dark romance. It contains discussions about mental health issues and dubious situations that some listeners might find offensive. Dark romance is subjective. Some listeners have found this book to be a light listen, while others were sensitive to the material. Milo isn’t a normal romance hero, and some might not consider him a hero at <i>all</i>. So please don’t listen to this if any of the above bothers you.</p> <p>Please note that this is part of a series and not a stand-alone!</p>";
