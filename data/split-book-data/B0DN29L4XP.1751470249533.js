window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Deacon: I was born an Alpha with no desire to lead. My role is to protect my pack, support my Alpha, and pretend to be less than I am. If I do that, I can have the life I wantâ€”the one with Grace by my side far away from here. She is the only one who sees the real me. Not the spare. For the next eight months, I must prove my loyalty to my pack, establish alliances, and survive. All without her. She can't come with me, not yet. But I will be back to claim what's mine.</p> <p>Marcus: I'm the replacement. The Alpha who was never supposed to be here. My lineage never allowed me opportunities to mingle with the elite, and I won't let this chance go to waste. I need alliances. I need to prove my wolf can stand with the best of them. Being the new guy is hard enough, but I love a challenge. They underestimate me, and I plan to use that to my advantage to take what's rightfully mine.</p> <p>A journey of young lovers, friends who become brothers, and betrayal from within. Torn apart with nothing left, this is a villain origin story; one that only the Fates saw coming.</p>";
