But my partners were meant for greater things; I can feel it in my bones.</p> <p>Kirby is radiance and light. His presence is too big for a Welsh valley in the middle of nowhere. Cai is doing so well, but he is clearly a shattered man.</p> <p>They both need more, and I need to give it to them. The world needs them too. It would be selfish of me to keep Cai and Kirby to myself. If only I knew how to get us out of this situation.</p> <p>Then, the night Ri lays his eggs, everything changes.</p> <p>I'm having visions. I know things I shouldn't. I'm guided to a miracle for Cai.

It contains a gay why-choose love triangle with high steam, high stakes, high angst, and a happy-for-now ending. It is book two of the series which is intended to be listened to in order. For mature listeners.</i></p>";
