I mean, what could possibly go wrong? </p> <p>As the king's eldest son, Rayth grew up expecting to rule. Instead, he ended up disgraced and exiled. When he unknowingly stumbled upon the last five dragon eggs in existence, using the creatures to take back his crown was the last thing on his mind. </p> <p>All that changed after Rayth's brother Oblisii murdered their father and stole the kingship. With that fateful blow, what started out as a simple rescue mission to find our lost comrade has become something much more. </p> <p>We won't be safe until Oblisii is dead, and dragons are once more protected in the land of Utrea. To make that happen, we'll have to risk everything in a desperate gamble to control the throne. </p> <p><b>In the end, I just want my family back. </b></p> <p><b>I'll do whatever it takes to make that happen.</b> </p> <p><b><i>The Dragon Mistress: Book 4</i></b> by <i>USA Today</i> best seller R. A. Steffan is the last installment in a medium-burn fantasy romance series with dragonriders, where the heroine doesn't have to pick one person at the end. It is part of the Eburosi Chronicles, along with <i>The Horse Mistress</i> and <i>The Lion Mistress</i>. It's not necessary to have read or listened to any of the other books in the series before starting The Dragon Mistress arc. </p> <p><b>A special note for Fantasy listeners:</b> Herein, you will find explicit sex scenes, not all of which are heterosexual. If your gut reaction to that is \"Eww\" or even \"Meh\", you probably won't enjoy this series.</p>";
