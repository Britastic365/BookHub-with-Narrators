But reminders of her past, like Deputy Sheriff Jackson Perdue, are everywhere. And a spate of recent deaths - each victim burned in the same horrifying manner as her husband - leave Jack and Cathy in no doubt that a serial killer is at work....</p> <p>Now as a twisted killer moves in for a final, brutal act of vengeance, buried crimes are coming to light once more. And this time, justice will be swift, merciless, and as silent as the grave....</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
