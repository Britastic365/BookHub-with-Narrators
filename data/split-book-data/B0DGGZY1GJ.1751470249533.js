window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Jack Kingston is known for his dominant playing skills on the ice, but off, he’s a down-to-earth guy who values a true connection over a meaningless hookup.</p> <p>I love being a member of the Pittsburgh Titans, even if my teammates are constantly ribbing me about women who they claim are throwing themselves all over me. Could I go for the easy lay? Sure, but that’s not my style. I’m more of long-term kind of guy. Instead, I’m going to keep doing what I do best—killing it out on the ice. Everything else will fall into place…eventually.</p> <p>That time comes sooner than expected, in the most unlikely of ways. At the rink to watch our goalie’s kids play Peewee hockey, I meet Willa Montreaux and somehow, by the end of that interaction, I’ve offered to help her coach the Ice Pups. Altruism or were there other intentions in that offer? A little of both, if I’m being honest.</p> <p>As the time I spend with Willa increases, I am absolutely certain I want even more. She’s gorgeous, sure, but that’s superficial. Willa is also funny, loving, determined and smart. SO smart. Doctor smart. Probably too intelligent for a jock like me, but that’s not going to stop me from shooting my shot.</p> <p>Not looking for anything more than a fling and concerned that she’s too old for me, Willa doesn’t want to venture into anything serious. I’m willing to put in the work and give her the space she needs to come to terms with the fact that the connection we have is far more than physical. Willa and I are end game, but I’m willing to play into overtime if that’s what it takes to walk away with her by my side.</p>";
