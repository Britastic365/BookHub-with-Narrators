window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Colin</b></p> <p>I've devoted my life to my son, always putting his needs first, and honestly, I wouldn't have it any other way. Becoming a father was the best decision I've ever made, but hell, single parenting is difficult. I'm so tired of holding everything together.</p> <p>I need a partner, someone to share my life with. I miss intimacy and passion. I want someone who will take charge and help me let go of all this control I cling to. But an endless string of bad dates and rejection has me feeling like maybe love will never come for me. Maybe a father is all I'm meant to be in this life.</p> <p><b>Ethan</b></p> <p>My next-door neighbor is infuriating. He's intelligent and flirty and just so bloody gorgeous. Why are Americans so cheerful and loud? I hate him. I could not hate him more.</p> <p>What began as a reckless feud between competitive neighbors has somehow morphed into an attraction I can't ignore. I feel unhinged around him. I want Colin. I want him so badly it hurts.</p> <p>But he has a kidâ€”an inquisitive, bright little boy who is just as charming as his dad. And the hard truth is Colin can't afford to take a chance on me. I don't do commitment. Not anymore. Not since my ex. A stubborn, set-in-his-ways prat like me isn't cut out to be a father, right?</p> <p><i>Colin </i>is a funny and steamy MM romance that features a single father, enemies-to-lovers, and a HEA. It is the sixth standalone in the Unexpected series.</p>";
