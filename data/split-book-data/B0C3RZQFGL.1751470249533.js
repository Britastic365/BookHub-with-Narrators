window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I'm no angel . . . or am I?</p> <p>Nameless. Forgotten. Lost on Earth for centuries with a disembodied voice as my only friend. Protecting the vulnerable without any help from above. No one to explain the rules. Nada. Zip. Zilch.</p> <p>So when High Angelus Gavriel finds me killing a very bad man, can he really blame me? Before I can explain, he drags me back to the place he swears is my home: Sanctuary.</p> <p>Halfway between Earth and the Celestial Realm, Sanctuary would be paradise if it weren't for the daily decontamination showers, hours spent carving the murder-marks off my skin to discover my true name, and thousands of prim and proper angels who tell me I stink. Literally.</p> <p>I'm the dirtiest Protector they've ever seen, but I can't stop fantasizing about Gavriel and his best friends. Those sexy-as-sin High Angeli don't know what to do with me, but I have a few ideas. I just need to find out my name so they'll see who I am deep down . . . even if I have a feeling I'm no angel.</p> <p>But what happens when my name is revealed, and it's worse than anyone ever imagined?</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
