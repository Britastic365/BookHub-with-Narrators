But she isn’t about to be a pawn—not again.</p> <p>Haunted by his dark and bloody past, Gabriel may have no choice but to reunite with the woman from his nightmares to get Calla back, while Atlas, Kade, and Lex are left to deal with the vampire hunters, an age-old threat that has made a deadly, modern-day comeback.</p> <p>When Calla finally gets the answers she’s been searching for and discovers there are more dangerous things than the men she wants to hate but her body craves, she must face the reality that letting herself care about them only gives her more to lose. And with enemies closing in on all sides, she could lose everything.</p> <p><i>Tempted by Fire </i>is the second installment in the steamy, unputdownable Blood Oath series!</p>";
