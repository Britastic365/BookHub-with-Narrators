Like my ex-best friend once said, fairytales are not real, and there is no prince on a white horse coming to save you. She was right. I was naive to think I deserved a happily ever after—until him.</p> <p>Dark, tall, handsome, and twice my age. I knew nothing about him, but it seemed he knew everything about me. Like I said, everything I knew about myself was nothing more than a fabrication, and now I had resentment pumping through my blood.</p> <p>The old Connie is long gone. Say hello to the new and improved.</p> <p><i>The Resentment </i>is book one in the Illicit Love series, which consists of four interconnected standalones. It's best to listen to the series in order, and after listening to <i>Dear Heart, You Screwed Me.</i></p>";
