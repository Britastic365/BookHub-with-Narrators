window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The Dark Protectors are back! All new stories and a great entry point for new fans! Vampire King Ronan Kayrs wasn't supposed to survive the savage sacrifice he willingly endured to rid the world of the ultimate evil. He wasn't supposed to emerge in this time and place, and he sure as hell wasn't supposed to finally touch the woman who's haunted his dreams for centuries. Yet here he is, in an era where vampires are hidden, the enemy has grown stronger, and his mate has no idea of the power she holds. </p> <p>Dr. Faith Cooper is flummoxed by irrefutable proof that not only do vampires exist... they're hot blooded, able to walk in sunlight, and shockingly sexy. Faith has always depended on science, but the restlessness she feels around this predatory male defies reason. Especially when it grows into a hunger only he can satisfy - that is if they can survive the evil hunting them both.</p>";
