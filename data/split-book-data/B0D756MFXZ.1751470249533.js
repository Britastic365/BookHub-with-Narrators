window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>I heard the stories about Savage Ax. They're whispered among vampires everywhere in the Hidden Realm.</b></p> <p>He's dangerous, merciless, a predator even among monsters…but nobody told me that he was dangerously sexy, too.</p> <p>Now, on top of having to go searching for a vampire out there in the human world infested with sorcerers, I have to do it with him by my side.</p> <p>Handling Savage Ax didn't seem like a big deal—despite his looks, our covens are sworn enemies. Despite his reputation, I have the green light to get rid of him if needed. And it's all fun and games, empty threats and dirty words at first…</p> <p>But there's a spark of madness in his eyes that draws me in. Something about the way he takes what he wants, even from me, and gives no explanation in return. Something about the rough touch of his hand that melts the ice I've spent years layering all around me.</p> <p>The farther away from home we go, the easier it gets to forget who he is. Who I am. Where we are.</p> <p>And that's exactly where my real troubles will begin…</p> <p>Savage Ax <i>is the first book in The Hidden Realm series, told from dual POVs and packed with magic, mayhem, and romantic scenes intended for mature audiences.</i></p>";
