window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When my manager assigns me the task of finding a new wake-up call service for our CEO, I think, how hard can this be? Answer: practically impossible. </p> <p>It turns out that no wake-up call company in the world will take him on as a client. They’ve all had enough of his surly personality. So, in an effort not to lose my job, I secretly start making the calls myself, every day at 4:30 am sharp. OMG yes, you read that right - four freaking thirty in the morning. </p> <p>Here's a confession: I’m not the nicest wake-up-call girl at that hour. Hello! Who wakes up before the roosters are even crowing? Luckily, he doesn’t seem to mind my get-your-ass-out-of-bed attitude.</p> <p>Day by day, we’re becoming closer, and the calls start turning hot...like pay-by-the-minute hot and oh-so-wild. Snuggled under the covers with the moonlight streaming through the windows, we divulge our secrets to each other, but the one thing that he can never find out is that the sexy vixen who wakes him up every morning is just the lowly assistant who wears frumpy dresses. I can only imagine his disappointment.</p> <p>Now, he wants to take me out on a date and he’s scouring Manhattan to find me. He’s an overachieving billionaire bent on a mission. How much longer can I keep up this charade?</p>";
