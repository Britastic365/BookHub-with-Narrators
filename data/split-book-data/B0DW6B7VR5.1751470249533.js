window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The war is over. The curse is lifted. Malakai is gone.</p> <p>It's been two years since Ophelia has seen the boy she loves. When a treaty was signed ending the war and lifting the curse on Mystique Warriors, Malakai left to attempt the sacred ritual known as the Undertaking.</p> <p>He never returned, and the Undertaking was forbidden. Ophelia's world crumbled around her.</p> <p>Since then, she has pursued a fruitless search for answers.
