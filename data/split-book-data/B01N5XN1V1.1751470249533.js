She claims she's in town for the wedding and wants to mend fences. Lucy invites Eden to stay with them - after all, family is family - but her boss, SSA Noah Armstrong, knows far more about Eden's sketchy past than he's let on. </p> <p>While Lucy is focused on her investigation tracking down dozens of children sold through illegal adoptions, Noah begins a quiet investigation of Eden and her elusive twin, Liam.

The twins will do anything to get it - including putting Lucy's life in danger. It'll take everyone - Kincaids and Rogans alike - to stop Liam before someone dies. Unfortunately, Liam's treachery has unforeseen consequences for Sean and Lucy, as a longtime enemy of the Rogan family hell-bent on revenge sees an opportunity to make them all pay....</p>";
