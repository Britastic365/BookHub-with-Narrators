Or so I thought.</b></p> <p>I enlisted in the military to make a life for us and she promised to wait. Only, she crushed my heart, along with our dreams, when she married someone else.</p> <p>Every inch of Wilder Valley is etched with memories of her, so I stay away, building a career for more than two decades.</p> <p>But I can’t stay away forever.</p> <p>When I return home, nothing is the way I expect it to be. My family has changed, but most surprising is discovering that Sarah is back too.</p> <p>Separated from her husband, she’s raising her two teenage boys, living with her parents, and waiting tables at the diner.</p> <p>Curiosity draws me to her, but that’s not what makes me stay. From the moment our eyes meet, the feelings I’d long forgotten come rushing back.</p> <p>I’ve never loved anyone the way I’ve loved her. Maybe fate has brought us together again for a reason. Maybe finding each other too young was our only mistake. Maybe this is our second chance.</p> <p><i>Aiden and Sarah’s book is the next standalone in the Wilder Valley series. This second chance, small town, single parent romance features a couple in their forties reconnecting after almost two decades apart.</i></p>";
