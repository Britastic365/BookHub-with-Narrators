window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>She was raised to be a damsel, but she's about to become the hero of her love story. </i></b></p> <p>Fae Princess Charlotte was born for one purpose—to wed the Beast Prince and break a cruel curse. But she had other plans; to find her childhood love who was ripped from her and thrown into the kingdom's deadly Convergence Games. After pulling a runaway bride maneuver, Charlotte is on her lover's trail… until she's mistaken for a commoner and forced into the gaming arena herself.</p> <p>Jorge was born a servant—insignificant in the eyes of the palace. But his heart always belonged to the princess who was promised to another. After the guards found them in a compromising position, he was taken from her and forced to become a warrior. Not only did he survive, he thrived, sharpening himself into a weapon, rising through the ranks of the Solmane army to stand at the right hand of the Beast Prince—all so he could steal the princess back when she came for her wedding day.</p> <p>That day came, but the bride was nowhere to be found. The princess he vowed to rescue vanished only to reappear in the very arena he barely escaped. Now he must re-enter the brutal games to save her. But in the Convergence Games, there are no second chances. Only victory—or death. Definitely no room for a forbidden love to bloom.</p> <p><b>On Lunaterra, fate is a cruel matchmaker—binding enemies, forging impossible alliances, and turning betrayal into desire. When kingdoms fall, curses rise, and war looms, love is the most dangerous game of all.</b></p>";
