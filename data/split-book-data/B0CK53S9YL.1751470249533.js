But I’d have better luck convincing my mom that the sky is green than getting her to understand I’m happy being single.<br> <br> Left with no other choice, I ask the biggest manwhore I know to be my date for a wedding weekend. He has just enough charm to make my family fall in love with him, but not enough that I will. Too bad the bottom half of me doesn’t get the message.<br> <br> But even if he gets my legs to open for him, he’ll never get my heart to do the same.</p>";
