window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Katie MacAlister comes a series about finding your own wonderland - through one roadblock at a time... </p> <p>Nothing about Alice Wood's life is normal right now. Her fianc√© Patrick called off their wedding and relationship only days before their nonrefundable wedding trip. And though a luxurious European river cruise for one is just what she needs, it's not what she gets... Due to a horrible misunderstanding, Alice is now cramped in her \"romantic\" suite with one of Patrick's friends. Instead of cruising along the Rhine, Main, and Danube rivers sipping champagne with the love of her life, she's navigating the waters with a strange - yet mysteriously handsome - British aristocrat. </p> <p>An author, Elliot is just looking for some alone time to write. But his stodgy, serious self is about to be sidetracked by a woman who seems to have jumped out of the pages of a fairy tale, one who is determined to shake up his life... and include him in her own\" happily ever after\".</p>";
