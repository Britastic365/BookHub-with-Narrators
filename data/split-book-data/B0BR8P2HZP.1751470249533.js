It will take me five years to pay off the debt but I get to be his personal assistant. Personal assistant to the king. That can’t be so bad, right?</p> <p><i>Wrong. Oh how wrong I was.</i></p> <p>His council has tasked me with finding him a wife before they will fund his war against the Nightfall Queen. That part should be easy, he’s rich, disgustingly handsome, and smart to boot. The problem? He’s rejecting every high born female I send his way.</p> <p>The more time we spend together, the more we realize I’m not just some half elf.
