When she inexplicably wakes years later in a new world full of magic, and where humans are the enemy, all she wants is to find her two best friends...if they’re even alive. </p> <p>Jasper knows he is someone damaged and dangerous, the scars on his body prove it. But his memories have been taken from him. He knows not why, or how, he came to be in the locked room with the pretty, vulnerable human, but he knows three things: The King wants him dead, Ada is his mate, and he’ll do anything to claim her.</p> <p>Trusting each other is their first step to uncovering the truth and avoiding certain death.
