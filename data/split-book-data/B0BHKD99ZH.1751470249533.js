window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>As the daughter of Dracula, you would think I’d be born the perfect monster. <br> <br> You couldn’t be more wrong. <br> <br> As far as monsters go, I’m a screw up—if I’m not tripping over my own feet, I’m accidentally murdering someone (it’s a real issue, guys). <br> <br> Left with no choice, Dad decides to send me to Prodigium—otherwise known as Monster Academy—to train me on how to be a better monster. <br> <br> When bodies turn up on campus, I’m the prime suspect (not that I can blame them. I’ll be pretty suspicious, too, if bodies drained of blood show up right after Dracula’s daughter arrives). <br> <br> With the help of my mortal-nemesis Vin, Van Helsing’s son <br> <br> Frankie, Frankenstein’s son <br> <br> Mason, Medusa’s son <br> <br> And Jack (sometimes Hux), Dr. Jekyll’s son <br> <br> I might have a chance of uncovering the truth. <br> <br> If I’m not murdered first. <br> <br> The struggles of being a vampire, am I right? <br> <br> <b>This is a horror comedy reverse harem with some dark elements. After all, you can’t have a bunch of monsters without some darkness. This is book one of a series.</b></p>";
