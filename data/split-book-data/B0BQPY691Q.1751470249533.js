window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>For her entire life, Rose Maxwell trained to become the next Prima on the Supernatural Council. Now that she’s stepped down, it’s time for this witch to focus on herself—and not think about her impulsive one-night stand with Damian Adams, a half-demon veterinarian who she can’t get out of her head, since neither of them is looking for a relationship.</p> <p>But when Rose is sentenced to community service at Damian’s animal sanctuary, it becomes impossible for them to ignore their sparking attraction. A friends-with-benefits, no feelings, no-strings-arrangement works perfectly for them both. After a sequence of dead-end jobs, it’s not until Rose tangos with two snarly demons that she thinks she’s finally found her path. However, this puts Damian back on the periphery of a world he thought he left behind. He doesn’t approve of Rose becoming a Hunter, but if there's one thing he's learned about the stubborn witch, it's that telling her not to do something is a sure-fire way to make sure she does.</p> <p>Working—and sleeping—together awakens feelings Damian never knew he had...and shouldn't have—because thanks to his ex's hex, if he falls in love, he'll not only lose his heart but also his humanity.</p>";
