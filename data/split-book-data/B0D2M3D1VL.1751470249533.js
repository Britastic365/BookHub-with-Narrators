window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A spicy and hilarious opposites attract romantic comedy.</p> <p>Raine</p> <p>I haven't spent much time with Sophie since we were kids. When we started high school, we headed in different directions and never looked back. She invited me to her wedding this weekend. I don't want to go because despite all our years apart, I know one thing hasn't changed: her mission to find me the perfect man. I've told her I don't have time for dating, but she never listens. I'm guessing she's going to be pushing some guy at me the minute I get off the plane.</p> <p>Alex</p> <p>My teammate Seb's getting married this weekend. I'm happy for him, but I can't relate to it at all. He wants to spend the rest of his life with Sophie. I don't even want to spend the rest of the night with the women who end up in my bed. I'm fine with that, but for some reason, Sophie's not. Even with my best efforts to stop it, she's been trying to find me love since the day we met. She told me one of her childhood friends is coming to the wedding, so I'm guessing that's who I'll be hiding from all weekend.</p> <p>It's all fun and games until someone catches feelings.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
