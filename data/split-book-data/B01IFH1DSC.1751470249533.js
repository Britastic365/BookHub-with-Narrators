window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Leah Buchanan's family has been in service to vampires for five centuries. Even so, Leah wants nothing to do with her family's legacy. But when she's summoned to her Selection by the Vampire Dominion, under familial pressure, she has no choice but to go. </p> <p>Lucien has been living under the strict edicts of the Vampire Dominion for centuries, but he's tired of these ancient laws stripping away everything that is the essence of the vampire. So he's taking it back. And this is because Lucien has been watching and waiting for decades for Leah to become available for a Selection, and he will not be limited with what he can do with her. He will have her, all of her. Therefore, Lucien is going to tame Leah, even if he gets hunted and killed for doing it. What neither Leah nor Lucien expects is the strong bond that will form between them, connecting them on unprecedented levels for mortals or immortals. And what will grow between them means they will challenge their ways of life and their union will begin The Prophesies, which makes them one of three couples who will save humanity or die in the effort. </p>";
