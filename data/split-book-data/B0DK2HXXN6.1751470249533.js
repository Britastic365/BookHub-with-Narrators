window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I'm an omega left behind.</p> <p>I’m damaged, forced to hide my nature, with a scent that can turn alphas violent. I was told there would be no normal, no friends, or dream pack waiting in the distance.</p> <p>But I have one last chance at love.</p> <p>Tomorrow, at the academy ball, my scent blockers will fade. My mates—the ones I was told I would never have—will see me.</p> <p>But with one night to go, everything falls apart, and I find myself blackmailed by ruthless alphas. They are set on keeping my scent for themselves.</p> <p>Dusk, Umbra, and Ransom are the only alphas in the school more prestigious than my mates. Arrogant, beautiful, and deadly, they’re an enigma, shunning all omega attention.</p> <p>Until now.</p> <p>Too late, I learn that their pack lead, Dusk Varis, is as obsessed as he is unhinged. He doesn't care about my dreams or scent-matched mates. He claims what he wants without asking.</p> <p>And what he wants is me.</p> <p>This book is a MFMM why choose, with dark themes between love interests unlike other PoisonVerse books. This is part one of a trilogy that exists in the larger PoisonVerse Universe!</p>";
