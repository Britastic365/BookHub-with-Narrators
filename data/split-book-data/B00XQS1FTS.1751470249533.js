But the corrupted Wood stands on the border, full of malevolent power, and its shadow lies over her life.<br> <br> Her people rely on the cold, driven wizard known only as the Dragon to keep its powers at bay. But he demands a terrible price for his help: one young woman handed over to serve him for ten years, a fate almost as terrible as falling to the Wood.<br> <br> The next choosing is fast approaching, and Agnieszka is afraid. She knows—<i>everyone</i> knows—that the Dragon will take Kasia: beautiful, graceful, brave Kasia, all the things Agnieszka isn’t, and her dearest friend in the world. And there is no way to save her.<br> <br> But Agnieszka fears the wrong things. For when the Dragon comes, it is not Kasia he will choose.</p>";
