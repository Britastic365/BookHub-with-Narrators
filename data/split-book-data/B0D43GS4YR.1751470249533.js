I was a fool to think we could ever be happy, that they would ever want me.</p> <p>It turns out that I'm destined to walk this earth alone, forsaken and forgotten, never anyone's first choice. If Gryphon, Oliver, Barret, and Lachlan don't want me, then no pack ever will.</p> <p>So, what's the point in even trying? There's nothing wrong with being alone after all. It's just unfortunate that my body has other ideas...</p> <p>I'm an Omega now, and I have just gone into heat. And an Omega can die if they don't receive an Alpha's touch. Yet I would rather die than grovel to that pack again.</p> <p>After all, I don't need to be saved. I can save myself.</p> <p>Saved <i>is a contemporary Omegaverse that will take you on an emotional rollercoaster from start to finish. There is no choosing, and scenes of MM/MMFM.
