Against the wishes of my escort guard, Solomon, I must seek the aid of the kingdom of my betrayer.</p> <p>As the connection between Solomon and I soars to new heights, one thing is becoming incredibly clear: my newfound abilities have brought with them secrets.

A mad prince, a lost friend, mortal enemies—I have to find a way to save my country and my sanity.</p>";
