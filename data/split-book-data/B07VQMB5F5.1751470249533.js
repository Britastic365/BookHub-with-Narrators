window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Our secret is out, and now we’re marked for death.</b><br> </p> <p>A lone survivor escaped the mountain battle, carrying news of our dragons’ existence to the court of Prince Oblisii.<br> </p> <p>Utrea’s dragons were supposed to have been wiped out long ago. Only these five remain - a male and four females. They’re all that’s left to carry on the species, but first we have to keep them alive.<br> </p> <p>The prince will come soon with his army, and I’m stuck on a mountaintop with my four knights in tarnished armor. Sometimes, I think these men will be the death of me long before the royal soldiers arrive. Other times, I think they may be my only salvation.<br> </p> <p>Before the five of us can flee Utrea for safer shores, I’ll have to form a soul-bond with the male dragon. Until then, he’s little more than a wild animal, dangerous, and unpredictable. And without the male, we’re lost, since the future of dragonkind rests on his shimmering white wings.<br> </p> <p>Yet the idea of the soul-bond fills me with terror. If I bind myself to him, his death would mean my death, just as my death would mean his. Already, the men I love are binding the female dragons one by one, tying their souls irrevocably together. With the others already bound, everything depends on me.<br> </p> <p>But danger lurks whether I accept that dragon-bond or not. I was already a wanted woman, after I spurned Prince Oblisii and escaped from his harem of concubines. Not only that, but I also fled straight into the arms of a group led by Oblisii’s disgraced older brother - Rathanii, the man who should have been Utrea’s king.<br> </p> <p>If Prince Oblisii gets hold of me again, death will be the least of my worries.</p> <p>And the gods only know what the others might do to try and get me back.<br> </p> <p><i>The Dragon Mistress</i> by <i>USA Today</i> bestseller R. A. Steffan is a medium-burn fantasy romance series where the heroine doesn’t have to choose one person at the end.
