Luckily, it turns out I'm not the only one who wants to see her fall. I'm fighting on all fronts, trying to stay alive through the trials while also joining the rebellion's fight.</p> <p>As a further complication, the pull I feel toward Rush is becoming harder to resist.

She forgot those on top have the farthest to fall. I'm determined to reveal to the mirror world who—and what—she really is.</p> <p>I will be her downfall.</p>";
