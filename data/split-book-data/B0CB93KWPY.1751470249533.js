window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>It was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime...now she’s just trying to stay alive.</b></p> <p>Rissa can’t believe her luck. She won an all-expenses paid trip on a luxury matchmaking cruise. She’s not looking for love, but a few weeks of five-star pampering while seeing the galaxy sounds perfect...until it all goes wrong. </p> <p>Abandoning ship wasn’t on her itinerary, and neither is the growly but oh-so-sexy alien who is half convinced she’s the enemy and utterly certain she’s <i>his</i>. She’s got a list of the reasons they’re wrong for each other, but when they’re together, everything just feels right. </p> <p>Crash landing on a prison planet may not be the vacation she dreamed of, but it might turn out to be the best “worst” day of her life.</p> <p><i>*Buckle up. This sci-fi romance contains an alien with fur, fangs, horns, and a very possessive attitude when it comes to the woman he’s claimed for his own.</i></p>";
