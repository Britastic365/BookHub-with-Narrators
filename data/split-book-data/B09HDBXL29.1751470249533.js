Now a far more fearsome brute has claimed me.</b></p> <p>The Brotherhood gave him the right to breed me, but that is not why I am naked, wet, and sore.</p> <p>My bottom bears the marks of his hard, punishing hand, because I defied my alpha.</p> <p>My body is slick with his seed and my own arousal, because he took me anyway.</p> <p>He didn't use me like a king enjoying a subject. He took me the way a beast claims his mate.</p> <p>It was long, hard, and painfully intense, but it was much more than that.</p> <p>It was primal.</p> <p><b>Publisher's Note:</b> <i>Primal</i> is a stand-alone novel, which is the second entry in the <i>Alpha Brotherhood</i> series. It includes spankings, rough sexual scenes, intense and humiliating punishments, and strong D/s themes. If such material offends you, please don't buy this book.</p>";
