But I can’t get one woman out of my head.</p> <p>Her. Adeline Klein, the sexy smart ass in wire-rimmed glasses and a polka-dot bikini, who stole my heart when we were teenagers.</p> <p>God, she was something….. But I’m pretty sure she hates me. I’ve tried to find her, but it’s like she dropped off the face of the earth. Then one day there she is—stranded on the side of the road, waiting for rescue, like Fate has arranged for me to be her knight in shining armor all over again. Only she would clearly prefer to kick me in the face.</p> <p>But do I let that keep me from trying to win her heart? No way. Because some things—like sweet, wounded women with hearts of gold—are worth fighting for.</p>";
