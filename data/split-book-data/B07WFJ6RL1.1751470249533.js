window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When her father's will leaves control of the family ranch to Ryder Malone, the very same man who once broke her heart, Sierra Morgan is more than a little upset. The last time she saw Ryder, she shot his hat right off his head, earning herself a long, hard spanking on her bare bottom that left her sore yet helplessly, infuriatingly aroused, and she had hoped to never see him again.</p> <p>Ryder has not gotten over Sierra, and this time, he isn't going to let her run off without giving him a chance to tell her how he feels, even if that means lassoing her and tying her to a chair.</p> <p>If she wants to inherit the ranch she loves, Sierra will have to work alongside Ryder for a year and convince him she is ready to run it. Though she plans to spend that year making his life a living hell, when she pushes the stern, handsome cowboy too far she soon ends up over his knee again. But this time, her body's response to his dominance cannot be ignored, and when Ryder takes her in his arms and claims her thoroughly, Sierra is left in no doubt that she belongs to him.</p> <p>Sierra is not used to doing as she is told, however, and when she is reckless with her safety, she quickly discovers that Ryder will not hesitate to punish her in ways that leave her cheeks blushing crimson and her bottom sore both inside and out. His stern, shameful correction merely increases her need for him, but once the ranch is finally hers, will she still want him by her side?</p> <p>Publisher's Note: <i>Taming His Cowgirl</i> includes spankings and sexual scenes. If such material offends you, please don't listen to this audiobook.</p>";
