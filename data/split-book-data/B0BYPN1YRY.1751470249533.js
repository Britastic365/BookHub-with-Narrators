window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I fall into the monster realm. Ryder captures me and makes me his personal prisoner.<br> <br> He doesn’t believe I’m a storm chaser but deems me the reincarnation of some femme fatale who seduced his entire team and murdered his BF. Unfortunately for me, I look just like her.<br> <br> While the ruthless demigod dragon hates me with a passion, he also burns for me.<br> <br> I shouldn’t crave the fireworks whenever we’re together—it always ends in disaster. Especially after I learn the dark truth—the vengeful gods cursed him to endure endless hunt until he finds his fated mate and slays her.<br> <br> I have one goal—to escape the perilous realm and the heat that makes me want him every second. Should I fail, I vow to bring Ryder to his knees he ruins me.<br> <br> <i>If you like a dominant, possessive, and damaged demigod dragon, tough nerdy heroine, panty-melting heat in action, and enemies-to-lovers trope, you’ll enjoy this series.</i></p>";
