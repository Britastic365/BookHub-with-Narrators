If anyone can figure it out, it's Dr. Kendra Michaels, who works with local and federal authorities on only the most impossible cases.

Desperate for leads, Kendra must set aside her personal feelings when agent-for-hire Adam Lynch also volunteers his special skills to aid in the search.</p> <p>But as the abductor's true purpose becomes clear, the trio uncovers a plot they never could have imagined - leading to a showdown they won't soon forget.</p>";
