A shapeshifter. A demonic jester.</p> <p>The Rippers have lost everything because of Florence. Her past is dangerously intertwined with their future, and nothing will tear her from their bloodthirsty grips. But the further they drag her into hell, the more they realize that fate is far more evil than any monster could beâ€”and that they aren't the only creatures after the doves.</p> <p>Love is a weakness. Trust is a weapon. And if these four are ever to find either, they will have to reopen wounds that are better left untouched.</p> <p>Can the demons love the very human they are destined to hate? Can Florence ever love them back?</p> <p>Demons and Doves <i>is a spicy MMFF why-choose dark romance with a gender-bent vampire Jack the Ripper, a shapeshifting creature, a demonic jester with a thirst for chaos, a broken FMC who becomes strong, a steampunk world, and a guaranteed happy ending.</i></p> <p>Demons and Doves <i>is the second book in the Freaks of Nature Duet.
