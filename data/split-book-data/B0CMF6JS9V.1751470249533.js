window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>\"In the Hour of Crows</i> enthralls like a delicious dark spell.”<br> —Glendy Vanderah, bestselling author of <i>Where the Forest Meets the Stars</i><br> <br> <b>In a small town in Appalachia, people paint their doorways blue to keep spirits away. Black ferns grow where death will follow. And Weatherly Opal Wilder is a Death Talker.</b><br> <br> When called upon, she can talk the death out of the dying and save their lives—only once, never twice. But this truly unique gift comes at a price, rooting Weatherly to people who only want her around when they need her and resent her unfamiliar ways when they don’t.<br> <br> Weatherly’s cousin Adaire also has a gift: she’s a Scryer and can see the future reflected back in dark surfaces. Right before she is killed in an accident, Adaire saw something unnerving, and that’s why Weatherly believes she was murdered—never thinking for a moment that it was an accident. But when Weatherly, for the first time, is unable to talk the death out of the mayor’s son, the whole town suspects she is out for revenge, that she <i>wouldn’t</i> save him.<br> <br> With the help of clues Adaire left behind and her family’s Granny Witch recipe box, Weatherly sets out to find the truth behind her cousin’s death, whatever it takes.<br> <br> Imbued with magic, witchery, and suspense, Dana Elmendorf’s <i>In the Hour of Crows</i> is a thrilling tale of friendship, identity, and love.</p>";
