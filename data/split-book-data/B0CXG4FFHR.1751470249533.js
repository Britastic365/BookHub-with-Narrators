That’s why she’s freezing her ass off in a tiny Norwegian village, looking for him.</p> <p>Magnus is the worst king in the history of their sea dragon clan. Considering his father - and his father before him - was a brutal tyrant, that’s saying something. But his problems just keep piling up.

And the woman he saved from being fish bait is a complication he can’t afford. Even if she’s stirring feelings inside him he hasn’t experienced, ever. Even if she might be <i>exactly </i>what he and his clan need.</p> <p><b><i>Deep Sea Love</i></b><b> is a steamy paranormal romance, the second book in the finished </b><b><i>Norse Sea Dragons</i></b><b> duet.
