window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Lieutenant Colonel Brenden Jasper lives a life of secrets, danger, and clandestine missions. As commander of the most elite Black Ops unit in the world, nothing is more important to him than protecting the country he loves. But there's a reason only the toughest, battle-tested, alpha men can call themselves members of the Black 2131 brotherhood. None but those in the highest realms of government even know of its existence, and it's Brenden's job to avoid emotional entanglements so he can keep it that way.</p> <p>Dr. Paige Nichols has spent her life ruled by logic and reason, teaching and analyzing art history, so nothing could have prepared her for the completely overwhelming attraction-at-first-sight when she sets eyes on Brenden. Their chance encounter at a party opens her up to a tantalizing dark side she never knew she hadâ€”and leaves her wanting so much more. But a man with a dark side often comes with way too many secrets . . . ones that could put her life in danger.</p> <p>Though their chemistry burns hotter than ever, when danger comes knocking on Paige's door, Brenden will have to walk a fine line between duty, honor, and love.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
