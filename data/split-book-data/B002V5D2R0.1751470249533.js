window.bookSummaryJSON = "Karen Marie Moning's \"Fever\" series is a coast-to-coast hit! The first two titles in this national best-selling series, <i>Darkfever</i> and <i>Bloodfever</i>, appeared on the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>USA Today</i>, and <i>Publishers Weekly</i> best-seller lists. <p>In <i>Faefever</i>, Karen Marie Moning returns to the shadowy Dublin Otherworld in an undeniably sexy novel her fans are feverish for. </p> <p>Changed by the choices she made in order to survive, Mac no longer is the na√Øve, idealistic, and glamorous girl newly arrived in Dublin. Now, on a quest to find her sister's killer, she is a major player in a deadly game, but with one great advantage: she knows how to find the one thing Fae and human alike are willing to kill for - the Sinsar Dubh, an ancient book of magic so dark it corrupts anyone who touches it. </p> <p>What Mac soon discovers, however, is worse than she had imagined. Surrounded by treachery, her enemies indistinguishable from her allies, she can be certain of only one thing - as All Hallows' Eve approaches, her time is running out.</p>";
