window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Ever wanted to fast-forward to your happily ever after? </p> <p>My name is Mackenzie Locke, and I'm a loveaholic. I haven't got a handle on men. Not even a little bit. So I staged an intervention and booked me and my two best friends into Love Rehab, complete with a love shaman, horse therapy and a bunch of stones that promise to change my life. I'm not leaving until I'm cured. </p> <p>Lesson one: the first night of your stay, don't have a one-night stand with the hottest guy you've ever seen in your life. Fail. </p> <p>Lesson two: make sure your one-night stand isn't planning on sticking around, teasing you, tempting you right back into his Levis. Big fail. </p> <p>Lesson three: Whoops. I forgot this one. I was too busy daydreaming about Blake McKenna's mouth on mine and the way his five o'clock shadow feels on my thighs. Epic fail. </p> <p>So maybe I'm not the best student. Maybe I wasted my time and money on Love Rehab. But I can't help that I want to spend every minute with Blake, naked under the stars. Perhaps he can teach me every lesson I ever needed to learn. </p> <p>A sexy stand-alone romance. </p>";
