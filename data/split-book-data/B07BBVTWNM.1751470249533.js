window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I grew up as a prince...and lead the life of a king. There isn't anyone or anything that doesn't want me, that isn't attracted to me. They can't help it. And I sure as hell don't want them to. I live for their lust, I crave touch like an addiction, I make them beg on their knees for one simple caress. As a male siren, it's my job to feed off emotion. And I was happy to do it. I am happy to do it. </p> <p>What I'm not happy about? Being told I have to mate with some withering human and stay loyal to that one person for the next few centuries. There's a war coming, and being the idiot I am, I offered to take one for the team in order to help a friend. Now my sexual appetite is taking a freaking kick in the nuts. And I'm left wondering if it's worth it. If she's worth it, with messy hair and dirty human hands. But I have a world to save. A job to do. Now, if only she would just let me do it rather than fighting me at every turn. </p> <p>I've lived lifetimes as the most irresistible being on the planet. Only to meet my match. With one. Measly. Human. They say hell's hot. They're wrong. Because Hope, my little human, is way hotter. And before this is over, she may just singe me alive. </p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
