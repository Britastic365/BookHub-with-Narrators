window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Callahan</b></p> <p>Fighting wildfires is the only thing I’ve ever wanted to do and I’m damn good at it. Being the captain of an interagency hotshot crew of wildland firefighters is high-risk, high-reward. The risk blindsided me five years ago when I lost one of my crew and was changed forever. Now the only rewards I allow are to work harder, smarter, and enjoy easy, sexy nights with strangers.</p> <p>Until I meet Prescott Timmons. Her smart-mouth and adventurous spirit have me forgetting all of my rules—until her past shows up and lies start to feel too familiar. I swear to never spare her a second glance, but when she finds herself in a life or death situation with mother nature, my instincts kick in, and I take action. Stranded and sharing a bed again, we’re forced to face our truth. Do we let this fire burn out or fight?</p>";
