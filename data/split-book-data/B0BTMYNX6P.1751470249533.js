I’m a nobody, a good girl, just doing my best to make ends meet.</p> <p>Afraid for my life, I beg and plead until I come face-to-face with my captor.</p> <p>Ace is a brute of a man with strong hands, green eyes, and a dark smile that makes me weak in the knees.

But when he kisses me instead I know he’s never letting me go, and that’s almost as terrifying as death.</p>";
