window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Maybe I was the girl Clara didn’t want me to be. Here I was with the goblin king, and I didn’t want him to stop. </b></p> <p>For the past 10 years, the Goblin King has stayed locked away in his caverns. He only opens his doors for one purpose: He will give one gold coin for every night a girl is willing to spend with him. Despite his fearsome reputation, his fangs, and his claws, the girls come back safe and sound, and they never say a word about it. One must be very desperate to accept such an offer…or very curious. Well, everyone says curiosity has always been my downfall. Too clever for a girl so beautiful. </p> <p>Now my family is on the brink of losing everything. My sister Clara knows the Goblin King’s story has always intrigued me, and she’s willing to sacrifice me to get her hands on his money. But I finally have the chance to sate my curiosity. </p> <p>What will I find when I get there? A man who is cruelly cursed, haunted by a past misdeed? Or the man who will unlock all of my secret desires? </p> <p>It has been a long time since the Goblin King trusted anyone, but if he is willing to trust me, I might be able to save him and his people. But the witch who cursed him is close at hand, and she doesn’t play fair. </p> <p><i>Beauty and the Goblin King</i> is a fairy-tale retelling for those who like an adorable happily ever after with a side of serious steaminess!</p>";
