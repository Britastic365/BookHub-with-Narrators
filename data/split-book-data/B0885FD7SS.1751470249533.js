window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Quint Adler is a small town crime reporter with bigger aspirations. Stuck in a hospital bed on his 40th birthday, he overhears a conversation that arouses his suspicions.</p> <p>Sensing an opportunity, Quint starts his own investigation, bypassing local law enforcement in the process. His inquiries lead him to the scene of a savage murder. And then a second one, even more barbaric in nature.</p> <p>But Quint is getting too immersed in the case. He’s gained the attention of The Shark, the sadistic criminal he pegs for the murders. The irony of the nickname is not lost on Quint, named after Robert Shaw’s shark-hunting character from <i>Jaws</i>. Life is imitating art.</p>";
