Drawn to the fire of magic, I approach the gods in their sacred circle. I am just a mortal, one of many. I shouldn't merit their attention.</p> <p>But behind the royal figures of the gods a shadow looms, menacing yellow eyes burning in its gloom. He asks me to dance. His clawed hands circle my waist, turning me to the sound of hoofbeats while his demonic voice whispers seductive lies in my ear. For one night and one night only, I let him touch me.</p> <p>When it's morning and gods return to their shrines, he stays.
