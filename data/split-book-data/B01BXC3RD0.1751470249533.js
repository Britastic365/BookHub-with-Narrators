window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Carivel was born female, but she has been secretly living as a boy for years in her adoptive village of Draebard. The last thing she needs is to fall for not one but two unattainable men - a dominating warrior and a reluctant wolf-shifter with a horrific past. Now the Alyrion Empire is poised to invade, and Carivel must choose whether to keep her secret or reveal it - not only to the men she loves but also to the powerful female ruler whose army could help protect Draebard during the coming war. </p> <p>Steamy and spellbinding, <i>The Horse Mistress, Book 1</i> combines detailed world building and a heartfelt romance between three noble, damaged people who have no one to turn to but each other. </p> <p>Author's note: This book contains descriptions of graphic sex, including sex between men, sex with multiple partners (MMF), and elements of fully consensual BDSM within a loving, established relationship. Additionally, it deals with issues of gender identity and gender fluidity. It is intended for a mature audience. </p>";
