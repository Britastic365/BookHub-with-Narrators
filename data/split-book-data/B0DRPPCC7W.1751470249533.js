window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The married woman of the manor. The stranger outside. An intoxicating novel of dark temptation and dangerous desire by the </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>USA Today</i></b><b> bestselling author of the Cat and Mouse Duet.</b></p> <p>November 12, 1944. This house holds on to souls for a lifetime. I thought I had given it to my husband when I vowed to love him until the end of time. I lied. Nothing could have prepared me for the day my phantom appeared outside my window. He was terrifying, yet hypnotizing, and I couldn’t deny my intrigue. I never intended to fall into a whirlwind romance with my stalker. Especially because he’s so much more than that. A criminal. A mobster. The man who offers me solace from the monster in Parsons Manor. There are many that haunt these halls, yet it’s only my husband I fear.</p>";
