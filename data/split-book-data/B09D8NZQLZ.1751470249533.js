window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A gripping friends-to-lovers-to-enemies dark romance.</p> <p>New York City - not for the fainthearted or the sweetest of souls. The last thing I expected was to be back in this city, after all these years. And I definitely did not expect to be back in this house, where it all started. I have spent years avoiding this place and the cold, hard reality of what happened here.</p> <p>But I have no choice. We are all quarantined together in this house. It took the end of the world for me to come back here and face him.</p> <p>Milo Sinclair.</p> <p>Once my legal guardian and savior in life. The person who saved me from drowning in loneliness. Who gave me everything I ever wanted. But then he took everything away from me. Plus interest. He broke me. He will not break me again.</p> <p>This is a dark forbidden romance. It contains discussions about the pandemic, mental health issues, and mature new adults. It also contains dubious situations that some listeners might find offensive.</p> <p>Dark romance is subjective. Some listeners have found this audiobook to be a light listen while others were sensitive to the material. Milo isn’t a normal romance hero, and some might not consider him a hero at all. So, please don’t listen to this if any of the above bothers you.</p> <p><i>Quarantined</i> is book one of the Quarantine series.</p>";
