window.bookSummaryJSON = "My body is changing, and so is the power dynamic inside the bunker. With the chimera serum racing through my veins, I can barely believe in a future for myself, much less one that includes Atlan. He's trying, though. Trying to convince me that his love is unbreakable . . . while I can barely think past my need for revenge on the people who did this to me. They have to pay, and they need to be stopped before they do more damage to what's left of the human race. Contains mature themes.
