window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Awoken </i>is a dark modern-day love story that’s more Grimm than Disney; if singing mice and dancing crabs are what you were looking for, this is not the book for you. Seances, time travel, and torture, however - if that’s your thing, you just might fit right in.</p> <p>Grace didn’t believe in ghosts or demons, she thought magic was something that only lived in the pages of fairy tales.</p> <p>How very wrong she was.</p> <p>Hidden away most of his life, Beau had successfully managed to mask his gift from the world. Having the ability to commune with the dead wasn’t exactly the best conversation starter, and that was okay, he didn’t much like people anyway, until he walked back into Gallows Wood and into Grace’s life. </p> <p>Struggling with the incessant onslaught of nightmares about her father’s untimely death, Grace had accepted that maybe she just wasn’t destined for a happily ever after. </p> <p>Fate however had a skewed sense of humor. The deeper Grace delves into Beau’s world, the further she wanders from the safety of her own. Plagued by the spirit of a sadistic serial killer long dead, Grace must harness what power she can to defeat him and stay alive. Awakening family secrets that Grace could never have imagined to be true begs the question: Had she been surrounded by magic longer than she had thought?</p> <p>How far into a world plagued by evil would you go to save the soul of the one you love?</p>";
