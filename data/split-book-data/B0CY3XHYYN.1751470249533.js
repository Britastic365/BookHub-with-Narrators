Left with no choice, I flee from the Solis continent even though my heart is shattering at leaving my love behind. But I can’t return to Solisarium until I’ve reclaimed my affinities and am able to fight with the crown prince at my side.</p> <p>Yet enemies lie everywhere, and those I thought I could trust prove to be the biggest traitors of them all. Trapped far from the icy north, I struggle to survive while learning who I’m destined to become.</p> <p>One thing I know—victory comes to those who are worthy—if only I can achieve the destiny the gods have created for me. </p> <p>Wings of Snow is book three in Fae of Snow &amp; Ice, a four-book enemies-to-lovers fae fantasy romance series that takes place in Krista Street’s Supernatural World.
