After being left in the dust of an old pickup truck, I promised that I would take care of myself and never trust another man with a sexy smirk and cowboy boots. Then he showed up, and he’s everywhere I turn, making me want something I shouldn’t. </p> <p>Asher </p> <p>I grew up in foster care, and on my 18th birthday, I was set free. I spent years coasting from town to town. Staying wasn’t a part of my plan, and neither was love, but somehow, I found both. This was all supposed to be temporary. Now I’m just hoping my secret doesn’t destroy the only family I’ve ever known....</p>";
