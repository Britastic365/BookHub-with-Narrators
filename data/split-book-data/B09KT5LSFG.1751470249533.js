window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the gutter to the stars...dance brought us back together.</b></p> <p>Our pain and hurt bled out with every movement, with every step across the dance floor. The Breakers never expected to love me again and I never believed we could get past our pain. Yet here we are. My Breakers are mine once more.</p> <p>But nothing is ever that simple when it comes to us. True happiness only comes when you’re free. Free to love. Free to dance. Free to live.</p> <p>But that kind of freedom comes at a high price.</p> <p>The Breakers are still members of the Skins. Jeb is still their leader. David is still a psychopath, and now there are new enemies to contend with. Dance might have brought us back together, but it’s going to take more than a beautiful routine to keep us all alive. It’s time for the Breakers to own up to their truth, just like I did. It’s time for the Breakers to live up to their name. It’s time for the Breakers to start breaking things.</p> <p><i>Breakers</i> is is book three of Academy of Stardom, a gritty, contemporary reverse-harem romance. If you love dance, your men on the criminal side, hot alpha-holes, and the friends-to-enemies-to-lovers trope, this is for you. Contains mature themes and ends on a cliff-hanger.</p>";
