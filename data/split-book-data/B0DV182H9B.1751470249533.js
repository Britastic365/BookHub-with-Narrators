window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>This book features the SAME PLOT and characters as </b><b><i>Prize of the Warlord</i></b><b>, but it's told from the Warlord's perspective instead of Ixiana's. Which means it's even hotter, and you get pieces of the story you didn't get in </b><b><i>Prize of the Warlord</i></b><b>. This was a much-requested POV flip, so I hope you enjoy it! If you haven't listened to </b><b><i>Prize of the Warlord</i></b><b> yet, you can still enjoy this book on its own.</b></p> <p>When Cronan captures the daughter of his greatest enemy, he plans to ransom her and change the fate of his clan. Though the young woman seems weak, he discovers a strength in her that he admires—and his body reacts to her in undeniable ways. When Cronan's anger and Ixiana's frustration ignite a new kind of fire, it could burn both his people and hers . . . or light the way to a brighter future.</p> <p>This adult romance has medium heat and spice, with dark themes. It's perfect for fans of Laura Thalassa, C. N. Crawford, and Sarah J. Maas.</p> <p>Contains mature themes. Trigger and content warnings are available on the author's website.</p>";
