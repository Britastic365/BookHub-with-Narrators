window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>Hades, the wickedly dark god-king of the Underworld, needs a queen.<br> <br> And he’s chosen Persephone.</i></b><br> <br> All Persephone has ever desired is control of her own life, and someone noticing her once in a while. Kept in her mother’s shadow, and overlooked by the entirety of Olympus, her dream seems impossible…and now she’s doomed to wed a dull god of her mother’s choosing….<br> <br> Until she crosses paths with a handsome, dark warrior who rouses wildfire heat in her veins—a male whose immense power is unmistakable, and who matches the fearful tales whispered in Olympus—stories of a cruel, heartless king who rules his realm of death with an iron fist.<br> <br> When Hades abducts her and imprisons her in the depths of the Underworld, a dormant part of her awakens. And as she slowly discovers the truth about him, Persephone isn’t sure whether the snarling, dark beast of a king is her doom…or her saviour…but she knows one thing….<br> <br> She will embrace the fire he awakens in her with every heated glance, and every vicious growl.<br> <br> And use it to tame him and forge her dreams into reality.</p> <p><b><i>Because, Persephone, the quiet, gentle goddess of nature, desires a king.</i></b></p> <p><b><i>And nothing will stop her from claiming his black heart.</i></b></p> <p><i>Queen of the Underworld is a forced proximity, enemies-to-lovers paranormal romance novel retelling the Greek myth of Hades and Persephone, and a prequel in my Guardians of Hades series. In the vein of an adult beauty and the beast, it features a grumpy-sunshine pairing that will steal your heart, with a secretly cinnamon roll hero and a secretly fiery heroine, and a powerful forever kind of love.</i></p>";
