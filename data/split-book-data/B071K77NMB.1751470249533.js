window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Tomb Raider meets urban fantasy in a new, spine-tingling adventure from a <i>New York Times</i> best seller...</b> </p> <p>Meet Nia Rivers: archaeologist, fashionista, and an ancient immortal with a serious memory problem. </p> <p>For the last couple of centuries, Nia has been trying to fill in the blanks of her past by shedding light on history's darkest stories. Her motto: the ugliest stories are the ones that deserve to be told the most. </p> <p>But when a mysterious woman comes forth with a 2000-year-old relic from Nia's past, Nia isn't sure if the story connected to it is one she wants told to the world. Unfortunately, Nia has no choice but to uncover the truth - fast - before a greedy land developer buries the site forever. The fact that he's also an immortal, with a millennia-old grudge against her, doesn't help. Neither do the dark assassins who have been stalking her for centuries, and who've suddenly decided to up their game to end her life. </p> <p>Letting her enemies have their way might be best for Nia, especially when the truth might expose a horrific crime from Nia's past. But all stories deserve to be told. </p> <p>Even the ugliest ones. </p> <p>Even if they say you might be a mass murderer. </p> <p><b>Scroll up and grab your copy today!</b> </p>";
