window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Colin Novak is the big man on campus. Huge—if the rumors are to be believed.</b> Nearly every girl at Davidson University has had a ride on him...everyone, except me.</p> <p>Which is fine. This frat boy may be irritatingly hot, all carved muscle with a deceptively wholesome smile, but that’s irrelevant. He’s a Sig.</p> <p>When I catch his fraternity cheating at the Greek Week tournament, he denies it—causing our rivalry between houses to escalate. Colin and I may have started the mud fight, but it grows into an all-out war and ends with us expelled from our houses.</p> <p>Now I’m homeless, and it’s all his fault.</p> <p>So, while answering an ad for a leading role at an adult-film company wasn’t part of my career path, the work comes with a lot of perks. Steady salary. Accommodations close to campus. A safe place to explore my fantasies.</p> <p>Except when I show up for my audition, my partner is none other than my new archenemy—Colin. And our sexual chemistry is explosive.</p> <p>We hate how attracted we are to each other, and I despise that I want every scene to be with him. Because the longer we live together, the more I see he’s not who I thought he was.</p> <p><b>This frat boy was so easy to hate...but what if he’s even easier to love?</b></p>";
