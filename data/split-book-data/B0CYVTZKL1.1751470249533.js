window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Twisted Pretty Things: In the glitzy underground world of illegal auctions, fast cars, and stolen magical artifacts, John \"Dom\" Domenici knows he's out of his depth. But he needs the job at Kempthorne &amp; Co. So when his boss, Alexander Kempthorne, wants him on a special case to track down an illegal artifact dealer, Dom can't say no.</p> <p>It shouldn't matter that the billionaire is sexy as sin, and it really shouldn't matter that there's an American agent stalking Dom, an agent who knows more than he should about Dom's case.</p> <p>Tide of Tricks: Forced to lie for Kempthorne, the unthinkable happens: Dom fails the latent competency test. One more strike and the life he's come to love at Kempthorne &amp; Co will be over. If that weren't bad enough, someone is stalking him, taunting him. Someone who knows what Dom did all those years ago.</p> <p>Trial by Fire: Time is running out for Dom. Outmaneuvered at every turn by the figure known as \"M\", only Kempthorne can free Dom, but juggling the horrors of his own past, containing a rising preternatural threat, and the twisted machinations of \"M\" might just be too much, even for Kempthorne. Can Kage Mitchell be trusted to help?</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
