window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Taken by an alien savage. Claimed with ferocious abandon...</b></p> <p>Being forced to mate with a Darvasson male is my greatest fear. The powerful aliens already took my sister, and the thought of leaving my widowed mother all alone breaks my heart. But the Darvassons are helping ensure the survival of humankind, and they expect compensation.</p> <p>When an ill-tempered Darvasson named Brute takes an interest in me, I'm utterly terrified. I try to hide, but it's no use. Everywhere I go, the hulking seven-foot-tall security officer is there. Watching me. Guarding me. Stalking me like it's his full-time job.</p> <p>Then it happens. One day, Brute snaps and carries me away to his private quarters. I try to resist the muscular beast, but it's difficult when his savage growls and fevered kisses make me tremble with longing. He says he's going to claim me and keep me as his bride—and he promises there's no escape.</p> <p>Brute's Mate <i>is a dark romance that includes power exchange, spankings, and intense scenes. For mature listeners.</i></p>";
