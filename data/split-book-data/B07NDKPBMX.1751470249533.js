window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Welcome to my hell...and not the good one where I’m in charge.</p> <p>Word on the street is that my brother’s son was potty trained at eight months old. Unacceptable. I shall not be bested by God. I have pilfered plastic potties, Cheerios, and bagels. I am prepared to teach my boy to put the pee in the hole. All I need now is a potty song.</p> <p>Or so I thought.</p> <p>Apparently, sending Lizard to clog all the commodes in Heaven has put me in hot water with Mother Nature. The certifiable woman has threatened a pole-dancing punishment if I don’t play nice with my brother. So I shall do what any sane leader of Hell would do - die my hair, shave my eyebrows, and go into hiding for a century.</p> <p>Desperate Devils do stupid things. But no one hides from Mother Nature for long, not even God and the Devil. Now we’re in a cornfield in Nowhere, Indiana. No magic. No cell phones. No IDs and three days to make nice and figure out how in the hell to get to Kentucky.</p> <p>Good luck to us....</p> <p>Sometimes you need a little heaven to raise a lot of hell.</p>";
