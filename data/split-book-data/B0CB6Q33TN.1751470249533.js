window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When I wake up at a female auction in a world I don’t recognize, all I can think about is getting back home to Texas. I want absolutely nothing to do with a realm called Valora, magic, faeries, or being sold to the highest bidder.</p> <p>But the Day Realm King has other plans.</p> <p>Zander says I’m his fated mate. I don’t believe him. That doesn’t stop him from tricking me into marrying him though. It doesn’t matter if I argue or run—he won’t let me go.</p> <p>I should hate him. Instead, I find myself ridiculously attracted to the stubborn, broody man. He terrifies me, so I don’t know why his rare smiles give me warm tingles or why his arms make me feel safe.</p> <p>Everything about Valora is confusing, but after just a short time here, I realize something—this place is full of dangers that are way more frightening than my new husband, and staying by his side just might be my only option.</p> <p><i>The Fae King's Prize </i>can be listened as a standalone novel, though the story is interconnected with other books in the Between Dawn and Dusk series.</p> <p>Other books in the series are:</p> <ul> <li><i>The Fae King's Curse</i> (Kirian and Quinn)</li> <li><i>The Fae King's Dream </i>(Damon and Whitley)</li> <li><i>The Fae Warrior's Princess</i> (Torius and Dani)</li> </ul>";
