window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the </b><b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><b> bestselling author of </b><b><i>44 Chapters About 4 Men</i></b><b> (inspiration for the Netflix original series </b><b><i>Sex/Life</i></b><b>) comes a New Adult romance with a dark, dystopian twist.</b><br> <br> <i>No getting attached. <br> <br> Leave before you get left. <br> <br> Supplies. Shelter. Self-defense. <br> <br> Survival above all else. </i><br> <br> I’ve lived my life by a strict set of rules—rules that have kept me alive, rules that have kept the nightmares of my past at bay. But the moment I met her, I crossed all of them out with a giant X and scrawled the words <i>Protect Rainbow Williams</i> next to them in murderous block letters. That’s all I cared about. Keeping her safe. Keeping her—period. <br> <br> But Rain doesn’t need me to protect her anymore. The danger is still out there—it’s <i>everywhere</i>—but she has her little found family now, a roof over her head, food on the table … <i>him</i>. <br> <br> And I have nobody to blame but myself. <br> <br> In my world, rules aren’t made to be broken. <br> <br> They’re made to keep you from breaking. <br> <br> A mistake I won’t make again. Because without Rain, there won’t be anything left of me to break. <br> <br> <i>* Previously published under the title </i>Fighting for Rain.<br> ** A comprehensive CW is available on the author’s website.</p>";
