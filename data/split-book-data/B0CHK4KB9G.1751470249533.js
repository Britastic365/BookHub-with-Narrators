Unfortunately, Cradle Mountain may not be the safe haven she’d thought. The son of her new patient may be tall, dark, and handsome...but he also knows all about her past.</p> <p>Keeping her job should be the hardest part. Keeping her heart safe seems to be much harder.</p> <p>Former Delta Flynn Talbot was kidnapped, separated from his sick mother, and irrevocably changed. His enemies now dead, he’s back in his hometown with his teammates, running Blue Halo Security, and his mom is his top priority. So when it turns out her new nurse has a questionable past, Flynn’s first instinct is to keep her the hell away from his mother. But Carina’s adamant she’s innocent. And something in her deep blue eyes makes him inclined to believe her.</p> <p>When one too many ill-fated events leave Carina needing help, Flynn steps up. It isn’t long before both discover there’s more danger surrounding her than they thought. And Flynn will risk everything for the woman who’s stumbled into his town, into his life...and into his heart.</p>";
