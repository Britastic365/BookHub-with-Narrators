window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When you’re married to the love of your life for 30 years and lose them tragically, the part of your heart capable of love dies with them. Or so I thought. Somehow, this tiny little imp of a woman has wormed her way into the hole left behind by my wife’s death. She is way too young, is being hunted with a price on her head, and I’m about to be a grandfather. Am I too old to overcome the obstacles this new romance is taking us on, or will it all be worth the risk to make her mine?</p>";
