window.bookSummaryJSON = "<h4>Tony Soprano, meet Stephanie Plum.</h4> <i>From USA Today Bestselling Author Gina LaManna</i> Wedding bells are ringing in Luzzi Land! The church is booked, the decorations are set, and the cakes—all ten of them—are ready to be frosted. Lacey Luzzi is getting married, and her grandmother finally gets to cry those tears of joy, gosh darn it. Until one phone call changes everything. When the Violet Society’s newest recruit is found dead at the St. Paul Cathedral, Lacey Luzzi is the first to be notified, and she’s not happy about it. After all, the bride-to-be is supposedly on vacation from all things unlawful. Even worse? She’s scheduled to be married at the scene of the crime in exactly one week. After the police rule the death a suicide, however, Lacey pushes aside her wedding dress and sets down her bouquet. The whole situation reeks of foul play, and Lacey’s determined to bring her friend’s murderer to justice—if it’s the last thing she does before walking down the aisle. Lacey, Clay, Meg, and Anthony have seven days to find the killer. If they fail, they’ll be changing out wedding invitations for funeral arrangements faster than Anthony can say I do. Assuming <i>“until death do us part” </i>doesn’t happen first. ** ** <i><b>Lacey Luzzi: Sugared is a full-length, humorous cozy mystery with a strong female protagonist in the spirit of Janet Evanovich’s Stephanie Plum, albeit one working for the wrong side of the law…<i></i></b><i> Note: This book can be read as a standalone, though it is part of a larger series and not all plot lines are resolved in a single book. It is rated a strong PG-13 for sarcasm and mild language. No graphic gore or sex.</i></i>";
