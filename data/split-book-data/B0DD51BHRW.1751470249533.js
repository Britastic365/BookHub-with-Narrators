window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Claimed by an alien emperor, made to submit night after night...</b></p> <p>I didn't mean to catch Emperor Radakk's eye. As a reluctant spy aboard the human worldship, my life depends upon my ability to go unnoticed, to be nothing but a lonely shadow moving about the ship as I collect intel for my mutinous father. But when I'm caught spying on Emperor Radakk, the huge muscular Darrvason takes an immediate interest in me. He prevents my arrest, but his help comes at a price: me. Turns out, the Darrvasons are low on females, and I'm soon selected as his mate.</p> <p>Not only does the handsome, seven-foot-tall royal think he owns me, but he also believes it's his right to punish me. When I defy him on our wedding night, he's quick to turn me over his knee.</p> <p>As time goes on, I try not to let myself feel anything for the brutish male, but it's difficult to think clearly when his savage kisses and rough coupling leave me breathless with desire. Maybe we can find happiness together. Or maybe not. His obsession with me borders on madness, and I'm starting to worry I'll forever be his captive bride.</p> <p>Radakk's Mate<i> is a dark romance for mature listeners.</i></p>";
