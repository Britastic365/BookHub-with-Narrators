He didn’t exactly give me a choice.<br> <br> He’s dark, jealous and incredibly possessive.<br> <br> And he’s just one of the villains in my story.<br> <br> I used to think he was my hero.<br> <br> Still, there’s one thing I know for sure. Whenever I need him, whenever I’m in danger, he comes for me. He’s proven that time and time again.<br> <br> But the game has changed, the stakes raised to life and death.<br> <br> And Silas may be the most dangerous of all. Because he’s the man who holds my heart in the palm of his hand.</p>";
