window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>How far would you go to win back the love of your life?’</p> <p>Only from Audible comes this exclusive laugh-out-loud rom com, perfect for fans of Emily Henry and Beth O’Leary.</p> <p>Kitty Harris has it all: cosily coupled up with boyfriend Archie, she’s putting in the hours at an ad agency to land her dream job. OK, so maybe they’ve become a bit<i> too</i> cosy in their routine, with pizza night every Thursday, and maybe the agency isn’t so much up-and-coming as been-and-gone, but Kitty is happy.</p> <p>Until one diamond ring sitting pretty in her pepperoni ruins everything. Kitty does NOT want to get married, not after being caught in the crosshairs of her parent’s destructive divorce. Desperate not to lose Archie altogether, Kitty takes a summer-long break so she can turn her ‘<i>I don’t</i>’ into <i>‘I do’</i>. Somehow.</p> <p>Enter Leo Evans, Kitty’s impeccably dressed advertising nemesis who loves to appear at the very worst moment. Needing a distraction of his own, Leo claims to have the cure for Kitty’s cold feet: a no-strings rebound fling and a ten-date plan to face her marriage fears. Kitty shouldn’t really be fraternizing with the gorgeous enemy, not when they’re about to go head-to-head for the biggest pitch of their careers, but if it means getting her happily-ever-after with Archie, it’s a risk she’s willing to take.</p> <p>This rebound is about to get complicated. Luckily, you can’t catch feelings when you’re still madly in love with someone else … right?</p>";
