Life was good. But then the head of the Bratva turned himself in and would only speak to me.</p> <p>My life began to unravel as people from my past returned, those I thought I could trust betrayed me, and men I should run from became my biggest temptation yet.</p> <p>One thing I know for certain: my life is full of lies, and lies always find a way to be free...</p> <p>These Sinful Lies <i>is the fourth and final book in the Sinners Bay series.
