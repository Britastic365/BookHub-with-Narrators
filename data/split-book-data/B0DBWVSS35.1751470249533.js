I'm a true child of the new world. I've never met a single other soul except for my dad, who decided to keep us out here in the Wastes when he escaped with me from the hospital that catastrophic night.</p> <p>But now Dad's gone, and I'm alone. Completely alone.

Something is here with me—someone is leaving me strange gifts by my campfire every night. And suddenly, I realize that I don't want to be alone anymore. I don't want them to go.</p> <p>When he finally shows himself to me, I realize that my mystery companion out here isn't human. And that suits me just fine.</p> <p><i>This is a collection of short stories set within the Monstrous universe, a post-apocalyptic m/m fantasy series that features monsters and human men falling in love. It is best to listen to the series in order. For mature listeners.</i></p>";
