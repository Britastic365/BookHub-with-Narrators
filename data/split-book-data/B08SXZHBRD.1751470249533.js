Reid. </p> <p>They were wrong for each other from the start. </p> <p>The jock and the nerd, what a clich√© they made. </p> <p>He was the town prince, and she was a nobody. </p> <p>Tyra Bradley was invisible. </p> <p>That is until she told him he needed some manners, and so began their game of cat and mouse. </p> <p>She ran, he chased. </p> <p>It was perfect. </p> <p>Except Vaughn Rees has a deep, dark secret. Promised to the NFL, but fated for something sinister, Vaughn knows she's forbidden fruit. To want more is to tempt death. He's already in too deep. </p> <p>When a betrayal unravels their fragile ties, the good girl runs as fast as she can. What Tyra doesn't know? They're a siren's song. She can run, but they'll always be bound. </p> <p>They're two souls torn apart and mended by fate. And now...Vaughn isn't the only one with a secret. </p> <p><i>The Prince and the Pawn</i> is an interconnected standalone and book four of a complete series.
