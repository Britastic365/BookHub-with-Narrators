But it was only the beginning.</b></p> <p>After my fated mate, Jett King, Alpha Heir to my abusive pack, killed me for shaming him, I thought I was finally free.</p> <p>Free to wind up in Hell with Cole, who teased me and trained me with methods that legally qualified as torture. It was an improvement.</p> <p>But when my fated mate imprisoned Daphne, my best friend, I had to find a way back. And since the possessive, overprotective male training me wouldn't just let me go get ripped to shreds, I had to poison him. With a kiss that's still seared into my memory.</p> <p>One deal with a demon later, I'm back in the world of living, determined to rescue my friend from our pack. I'm not the weak runt they used to bully anymoreâ€”and I plan to make them pay for what they did to her.</p> <p>But bending the rules of life and death isn't without consequences. And losing my life is the least of the dangers I'll face.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
