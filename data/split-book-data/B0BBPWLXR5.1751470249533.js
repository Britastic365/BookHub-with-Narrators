window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Death calls, I answer...quite literally.</b></p> <p>Every time I close my eyes, I see those who are about to die, and I’m unable to do anything to stop it. Until one day, when I try to save yet another victim, something inside of me just…flips.</p> <p>The shadows rise, and they’re hungry.</p> <p>All I ever wanted was to be normal. Instead, I found out just how different I am. I must learn to control my powers in order to take charge of my life. Because if not? Well, there are angels out there hunting me.</p> <p>I’m told demons are safe; demons won’t care about what I am.</p> <p>But if an angel ever finds out, they’ll kill me on sight. They think I’m a monster, something forbidden. They can never know the truth.</p> <p>When I stumble upon a group of men at a club–two demons and an angel–I don’t know what to do. I should run, but something about them calls to me. Something deliciously wicked. Something I want to explore. But giving into temptation might just bring my downfall.</p> <p><i>Darker Shade </i>is the first book in a series of standalones. It contains cursing, violence, and sexy times between multiple people, including people of the same sex. It's a darkish book that explores the thematic of death, so if that makes you uncomfortable, please skip this book.</p>";
