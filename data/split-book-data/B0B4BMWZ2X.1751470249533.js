I focus on her delicious creations instead, even though she’s the one I truly crave.</p> <p>I try to stay away, but I cannot. Everything draws me to her, and when I learn of her quest to find her sister, my mouth offers to help before my brain can stop it.</p> <p>I’m a failed hunter, not worthy of a mate, and every moment alone with the tempting female tests my control. She thinks of me as her protector, but if she knew the thoughts I have about her, she’d run the other way.</p> <p><b>SIOBHAN</b></p> <p>Everyone is happily settling down in our post-apocalyptic fortress. But I can’t rest yet; I have to get to my sister. It was my last promise to her before communications went dark. Problem is, she lives across the country, and there are miles of bug-filled America between us. </p> <p>When Zec’k, the sexy hunter who delivers and trades for supplies with our little colony, offers to help, I jump on the opportunity. It’s supposed to be an easy trip, but everything that could go wrong does. And now, I’m not sure I’ll survive this mission without falling for my Xarc’n guide.</p>";
