I didn’t think I had anyone to fear, except for in the shadows, the same ones that used to keep me safe.</p> <p>Moving to Cherry Hill meant I could start fresh, but this town holds something I wasn’t ready for. Not only do I find things out about myself and parts of my life I didn’t know existed, but I also meet him.</p> <p>Theo</p> <p>I was only here for a job.
