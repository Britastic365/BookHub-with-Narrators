Grief has made her a shell of her former self; eating away at every feeling and driving her slowly to the brink of madness. No matter how desperately she tries to feel something, nothing gets through.</p> <p>For millennia Dolor has walked the world, watching humanity evolve and devolve before him. After all this time, he has grown content where he is. With true friends at his side, he's created a profitable establishment; a BDSM club for the supernatural. Being one of the most powerful beings in creation has its perks, and he wants for nothing. Until Kisa...</p> <p>It's pain that brings them together. Something she needs to feel, and something he needs to exist. What they don't know, is what's about to be unleashed. Will Kisa put her life in Dolor's hands? Can Dolor teach Kisa to dance in her darkness, or will her pain consume them both?</p> <p><b>Contains mature themes.</b></p>";
