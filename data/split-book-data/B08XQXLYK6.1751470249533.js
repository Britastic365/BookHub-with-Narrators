window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Fall in love with The Muse, a swoony romantasy set in a modern day Paris that's full of magic, art, mysteries, and passion from #1 NYT Bestseller Lauren Blakely...Performed in duet by Shane East and Siiri Scott!</p> <p>The first time a woman stepped out of a painting, I thought I was seeing things.</p> <p>The second time, I thought I was going mad.</p> <p>The night she emerged from a Renoir, I felt something else entirely -- a deep stirring of desire, and the wish to get to know the brilliant beauty who's been trapped inside a painted garden for years.</p> <p>She can only come out at night in the Mus√©e d'Orsay, where I work. There, after hours, we wander through galleries, with the Van Goghs, the Monets, and the Toulouse Lautrecs the only witnesses to our midnight kisses and, soon, our trysts.</p> <p>She opens her heart to me, and I learn her story.</p> <p>But she keeps secrets too, ones I hope to unravel. Why she was trapped. Why Renoir is hunting her. And why artwork in famous museums across the world is starting to disintegrate.</p> <p>Why I, too, seem to be the only person who can repair the masterpieces.</p> <p>As I fall deeper for the woman who's trapped in a museum, I'm caught up in another side of Paris after dark, one inhabited by forgers, ghosts of famous artists and, impossibly, by Muses.</p> <p>But someone is after the woman I'm falling in love with, and it's up to me to save her...even if it means losing everything I've found with her.</p>";
