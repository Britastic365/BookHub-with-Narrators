She ended up claimed and bred.</b></p> <p>When Duncan awoke from long centuries of sleep, Aurora was waiting for him, ready to strike him down and avenge her ancestors. But the Lord of the Sky is not so easy to kill, and she ended up punished, sore, and screaming with every helpless climax as he ravaged her mercilessly.</p> <p>But the ancient beast didn't just strip her bare, spank her until she was soaked and sobbing, and then use her as savagely and shamefully as he pleased. He did much more than that.</p> <p>He bred her, seeding her virgin body ruthlessly and thoroughly, over and over again.</p> <p>When a dragon claims his mate, he leaves no doubt she is bound to him forever.</p> <p><b>Publisher's Note: </b><b><i>Skylord</i></b><b> is a stand-alone novel set in the same world as </b><b><i>Warlord</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>Overlord</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>Wolflord</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>Dragonlord</i></b><b>, and </b><b><i>Sealord</i></b><b>.
