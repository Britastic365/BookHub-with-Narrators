window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In all the years I loved Joshua Luca, he never knew it. My infatuation with him led to some stupid decisions, so I swore off my teenage crush and forgot about him.</p> <p>But our mums are still best friends and when I’m forced back to London, without me knowing, they arrange for me to stay with him.</p> <p>Joshua hasn’t lost his swagger, his charm or those oh-so-perfect lips that I’ve imagined kissing so many times. He takes me under his wing, helps me flat-hunt and even coaches me through some dates.</p> <p>Until his coaching starts to feel a lot like actual dating and my crush is back with a vengeance.</p> <p>I know that loving Joshua leads to disaster but I can’t help but wonder whether the way he looks at me has changed and whether when we kiss, it feels as real to him as it does to me.</p>";
