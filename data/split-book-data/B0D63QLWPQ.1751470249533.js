window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>I'm addicted to my stalker.</b></p> <p>He watches me at night, sneaking in through my living room window and making my blood turn to ice. I feel him all around me as chills snake down my spine. Each night he becomes bolder, getting closer and welcoming himself into my bedroom, feeding his addiction.</p> <p>When I feel the warmth of his skin brushing over mine, I pretend to sleep, terrified of what he plans to do with me. But when he touches me… my whole body comes alive.</p> <p>I've never seen his face, and don't even know his name, but I want to. Every part of me knows this is wrong, but I can't bring myself to lock the window, to tell him no.</p> <p>He thrills me, but living life on the edge doesn't come without consequences.</p> <p>He's sick in the head, addicted to this infatuation, and obsessed with his messed-up mind games. But maybe I'm just as sick as he is because, whether I like it or not… I'm addicted to my stalker.</p>";
