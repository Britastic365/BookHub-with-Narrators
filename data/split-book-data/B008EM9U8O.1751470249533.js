window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>As a Grave Witch, Alex solves murders by raising the dead. While she's always been on friendly terms with Death himself, lately things have become a lot more personal. But the personal takes a backseat to the professional when a string of suicides occurs in Nekros City.

And searching for the answers might mean Alex won't have a life to remember at all....</p>";
