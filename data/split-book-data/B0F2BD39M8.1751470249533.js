window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>He carries a secret that could cost him everything. She must trust the man she swore to hate. And the truth between them that burns hotter than the lies keeping them apart.</i></b></p> <p><b>PORTER</b></p> <p>I came to Morris Ranch to make things right, even though Cici Morris hates me for what she thinks I did to her brother. Keeping my promise to Maverick means living with her contempt, but I can handle that. What I didn’t expect was discovering the ranch is being systematically destroyed—or falling for the fiery woman determined to save her family’s legacy. Now, someone’s threatening not just the ranch but Cici herself, and I’m trapped between the promise I made and protecting the woman I’m falling in love with. If I tell her the truth about that night, I could lose her forever. If I don’t, I might lose her anyway.</p> <p><b>CICI</b></p> <p>I’ve spent two years rebuilding my life after losing my parents and nearly losing my brother in an accident. The last person I want help from is Porter Wheaton—the man responsible for almost destroying what’s left of my family. But with mysterious accidents plaguing the ranch and our finances in shambles, I’m running out of options. Working beside him daily is torture, especially when I start seeing glimpses of a man nothing like the monster I imagined. As we uncover a web of threats surrounding the ranch, I find myself drawn to his quiet strength and unwavering support. But just when I start to trust him, I discover what I believed ended up being wrong—and the truth could change everything I thought I knew about family, loyalty, and love.</p>";
