window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the Internet virtual reality game <i>Buckling Swashes,</i> Earless Erika and Black Corbin are two of the most deadly pirates to sail the online seas. And now they've met their matches: each other. But fearless Earless Erika is really just Amy - a financial analyst with little time in her life for anything but work. And Corbin is none other than the man behind the game - the programmer and owner of the company. He's intrigued by Amy, the only buccaneer to best him in this test of digital testosterone, while she just wants to take his arrogance down a peg. But soon the two find themselves comrades in arms against a merciless rival bent on Corbin's destruction - both on the virtual high seas and in real life. Only by setting aside their differences can they locate the actual people behind the swaggering swashbucklers - and along the way find that love can tame even the most fearsome of pirates.</p>";
