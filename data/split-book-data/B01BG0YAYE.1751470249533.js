window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>No connections. Play it safe. These were the rules Ivey lived her life by. Until she hit Mustang, Colorado, a perfectly imperfect town where the citizens were welcoming, and one of them included the tall, beautiful, macho-man rancher cowboy Grayson Cody. </p> <p>On the run for a decade, Ivey knew she was supposed to play it safe. But she was tired of being on the run. She wanted normal. She wanted real. She wanted a home. And she wanted Grayson Cody. And Grayson Cody wanted Ivey. No one who looked at them couldn't see they belonged together. There was one man in this world for Ivey and one woman in this world for Grayson Cody. So they fell in love. </p> <p>But just as quickly as they fell together, they were betrayed and torn apart. Separated for years, Ivey was certain her life would not include her rancher cowboy. Until the town of Mustang reached out to her when Gray was in trouble. Even though she thought he broke her heart, she charged in to help. Then Gray and Ivey discovered they were betrayed, and, not only that, but Gray had an enemy who would stop at nothing to defeat him. </p>";
