window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I’ve known my entire life that everyone in Hell wants me dead. They fear me. Not because I’m the Devil’s daughter—well, okay, that may be part of it—but because they think I’m a bad omen.</p> <p>My father was prophesied to have a son. Then I came along and every resident in Hell believes I’m the beginning of their end.</p> <p>I’m the female version of my father. I’m ruthless because I have to be. I’m a killer because it’s kill or be killed, and I sure as Hell don’t want to die. </p> <p>I’m nineteen, and I hit my immortality already. There’s only one weapon that can kill me. But that doesn’t mean I want to be tortured and maimed either. So I fight to prove they can’t take me down. </p> <p>This year I start Hell’s Fire Academy. It’s the school all Demons go to so we know where their skills best suit Hell. On the first day of school, I do something stupid. I save a Demon’s life instead of killing him. </p> <p>Then I see the only two guys I’ve ever called friends before. It’s been fourteen years, and it still feels like I’ve known them forever. It was always the three of us. Stronger together than we were apart. But I forgot about that and I forgot them. </p> <p>Then there’s my roommate; he’s the last Demon I wanted to share a room with. </p> <p>So why am I still here? Why do I trust these men to have my back? I haven’t trusted anyone except my dad since I was five, but I can’t seem to stay away from them. </p> <p>When I’m taken and tortured, I learn that I was betrayed. It hurts me more than I should have allowed it to. I let people into my heart, and I’m hurt because of it. </p> <p>But there’s more to the story than that. The problem is, can I trust the reason? Can I believe it’s the truth? </p> <p>**This is a reverse harem story, which means the female main character will have more than one lover. This book contains mature themes and violence.**</p>";
