window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>They call me soulless. A destroyer of innocents. An apocalypse waiting to happen. That's what getting dumped at the altar will do to you.</b></p> <p>Keeley Moore was as happy as a proverbial clam when he found his Beloved, the one woman fated to be the love of his immortal life. And then she left him at the altar without so much as a single word of explanation. One hundred and thirty years later, he's still trying NOT to think about her. </p> <p>Jenna Boyle has no idea who is the tortured, tormented, and sexy-as-sin man who claims she betrayed him a century ago. It's the present that concerns her, mostly in getting Keeley free from the monsters who have turned him from a peaceful vampire into a Thrall, the dreaded ancestor of all Dark Ones . . . one who is about to go into a murderous, unstoppable killing spree. Then there's the Weaver's Council, who threaten to banish Jenna for crimes she doesn't remember committing.</p> <p>Although Keeley is determined to keep Jenna from hurting him again, he's drawn to her time after time. If only he could find the source of his enthrallment . . . if only he could find a way to save Jenna without destroying himself . . . if only he had a future.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
