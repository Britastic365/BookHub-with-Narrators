window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Contains all three books in The Jane Harper Trilogy: </b><b><i>The Sentinel, The Raven, </i></b><b>and </b><b><i>The Host.</i></b></p> <p>In the icy darkness of the Arctic Ocean, a violent showdown between ruthless whale hunters and fervent environmentalists ends in explosive catastrophe: both ships sinking into the frigid abyss. Marooned on a desolate island, the survivors, now bitter enemies, are forced into an uneasy truce to withstand the merciless cold.</p> <p>Enter Jane Harper: undercover agent, razor-sharp and unflinching, wielding her wit as deftly as her fists. As she rallies the fractured group, they stumble upon ancient Viking ruins and awaken something primal and terrifying.</p> <p>Deep beneath the frozen ground, the <i>Draugar</i> stir. Undying Vikings walk the Earth again, controlled by hive-mind parasites connected by three sinister queens. Capable of subjugating and preserving all mammalian life, they see the world through ambitious eyes, spreading to any creature they can find—bears, whales, and even people.</p> <p>With time slipping away and the body count climbing, Jane must unravel the mystery of these parasites—whose origins may lie beyond the stars—and confront an unimaginable horror that transcends death itself. She fights not just for survival, but to prevent an unspeakable menace from consuming the world.</p> <p>With <i>The Sentinel</i>, #1 Audible and <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Jeremy Robinson unlocks his demented mind, claws into the dark recesses of his imagination, and plucks out a tale of horror, humor, science fiction, and heart, that will keep you listening even as the dead pile up.</p>";
