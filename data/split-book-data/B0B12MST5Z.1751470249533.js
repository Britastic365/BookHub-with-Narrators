window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>He’s cruel. Insufferably attractive. And broken beyond redemption.</b></p> <p>After the nightmare I just ran from, those details should have made him the perfect storm of \"do not touch\". Except I didn’t know any of this—other than the attractive part—when I met him. Our story started on a lie.</p> <p>He pretended to be someone else, and I didn't ask a lot of questions. Nor did I try to stop him when he snuck out of my hotel room in the wee hours of the morning. I was determined to start my new life on an uptick and a wild one-night with a hot stranger felt like just the ticket. Only I should have known something that good wouldn't end that easy.</p> <p>On my first night in my new house, our paths cross again when I discover he's my new neighbor. No longer the charming man I met in the bar, he's a grump, completely unfriendly, and utterly intolerable. As if this couldn't get any worse, I quickly learn I'm also his daughter’s new teacher. A wonderful daughter I can't help but fall in love with. Something I refuse to do with him.</p> <p>Our button-pushing back-and-forth never fails to get under my skin. If anything, his sudden off-limits status makes resisting this devil of a single dad that much easier, regardless of the temptation he presents. How searing his heated gaze is when I catch him staring. Or how breathless our stolen moments leave us. </p> <p>After all, this is the fresh start I so desperately need, and I will not let anything get in my way. No. I can’t give in to Doctor Heartless. No matter how hard he tries to change my mind. </p> <p><i>Doctor Heartless </i>is a deliciously steamy grumpy/sunshine enemies-to-lovers romance that will hit you straight in the feels! It is a stand-alone in the best-selling Boston's Billionaire Bachelors series featuring Boston's hottest billionaire doctors and the women they fall head over heels for!</p>";
