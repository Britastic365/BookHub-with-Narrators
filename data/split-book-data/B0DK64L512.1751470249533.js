window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Rafe</b></p> <p>I really, really don't like my neighbor.</p> <p>We've lived next door to each other for three years, and we couldn't be more opposite. I'm a quiet, introverted ghoul with a small friend group and a love of true crime podcasts and tabletop role-playing games. Dan Ewen is a party boy with an endless string of \"guests\" who likes to blare country music all night. He's loud, inconsiderate, messy, loud, a total dudebro… did I mention loud?</p> <p>When I start my new job as IT manager at Goliaths of Wrestling, an underground supernatural wrestling organization, I quickly discover that my terrible dullahan neighbor is now my new colleague. Great.</p> <p>I still don't like him. It doesn't change anything. I can avoid him at work. But when I spot him one night through his living room window doing something that is utterly shocking, obscene, really weird… I find myself thinking about my annoying neighbor. A lot.</p> <p>All the time, actually.</p> <p>Oh no.</p> <p><b>Dan</b></p> <p>That neighbor of mine is a cute, surly ghoul whose pretty green eyes and angry scowl just make me want to rile him up even more.</p> <p>We've never really been buddies, despite living side by side for three years. But when he starts working at Goliaths as our IT manager, helping to bring us into a new digital age, our lives begin to become a bit more entangled.</p> <p>Mainly because he starts watching me each night while I… relax. So I make sure to give him a good show through my living room window.</p> <p>I've always assumed Rafe Hare is straight, but it quickly becomes clear that I might be wrong. And when I propose a fantastic new way for us to get… ahem… friendlier, he's as all-in as I am.</p> <p>Which means I get to show him just how weird it can get with a dullahan. And I can't wait.</p>";
