window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Humans aren't as alone as they choose to believe. Every human possesses a supernatural trait that lies dormant within their genetic makeup. Centuries of diluting and breeding have allowed humans to think they are alone and untouched by magic. But what happens when something changes? </p> <p>As one of the seven lightning-struck women, Nadie Morgan has known for a while now that her fate would be forever changed...and revolve around a certain dragon. From the first time Dante Bell saw Nadie, he knew she was the one for him. There's just one problem - there's another in his life he's waiting on as well. </p> <p>When Jace Goodwin, a bear shifter and Mediator, finally comes back to the human realm after years away under circumstances out of his control, his first stop is Dante's Circle, where he finds not only his dragon but the woman they both have been waiting for. </p> <p>Once secrets are told and the sparks fly, Nadie's new life becomes something she never thought possible. However, there's another realm at play, and Jace and Nadie's dragon will have to fight harder than he's ever fought before to keep the life he's waited eons for. </p>";
