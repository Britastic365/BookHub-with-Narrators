window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>My life was no fairy tale. And in this kingdom called college, the rules went out the window. I’d known golden boy Theo Hunt was the one for me since we were kids. My heart was his for the taking, but I had become nothing more than the MVP of the campus king’s friend-zone. </p> <p>Easton Cole was a storm I couldn’t have predicted. He knocked me off my feet and stole my heart. But he was off-limits. Not only was he was Theo’s frat brother, but he was the teacher’s assistant in English 101, and I was acing every test. </p> <p>My heart was torn; my feelings, tangled...because as soon as I noticed Easton, Theo finally noticed me. I was in love with two guys, as different as night and day, but I could only have one. I only hoped I didn’t choose The Wrong Prince Charming.</p>";
