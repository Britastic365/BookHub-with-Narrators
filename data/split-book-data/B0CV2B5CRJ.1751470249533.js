window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>When fire meets ice cream, will passion turn into a melted mess or dessert flamb√©?</b></p> <p>Quinn Byrne is rare, even among fire elementals, with her powers hard-wired into her arousal. She can't touch herself without setting the sheets ablaze. With an incendiary sex drive, Quinn's dating life is dryer than the desert that surrounds her hometown of Phoenix, Arizona. She'd give anything to have a normal romantic relationship. But she knows one thing for sure: human men are out of the question. No exceptions. Not even if the guy is trying to woo her with delicious ice cream.</p> <p>August Nord is new to town, building a business that involves things staying cold. His whole life has been one long, icy stretch until a fiery redhead saunters into his ice cream shop. Quinn is the hottest accountant he's ever met, and a small business owner would be dense not to hire a professional to review their finances, right?</p> <p>As the two approach their attraction with wary steps, the sparks flying between them are all too real. Will the flames feed their burning desire or melt their chance of a happily ever after?</p>";
