window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>To save her people, she will become Her Dark Grace.<br> <br> Northern law demands sacrifice.</i></b><br> <br> For any shadow-marked born in the northern realm, this means death. No one knows that better than Eirlys, who escaped her own fate twenty-seven years ago. These nights she prowls the border between realms to rescue infants from cruel and fatal blades.<br> <br> When an encounter with a northern priest goes awry, Eirlys is lucky to escape with her life. Only to find that very life upended. The priest has identified her as the lost northern heir who stands to inherit the crown. Seeking revenge for herself and every shadow-marked she couldn’t save, Eirlys chooses to take her place in the north and dismantle it from the inside.<br> <br> But then, Eirlys is thrown under the protection of the same priest who ruined her life and worships the gods she needs to destroy. A dark secret held in his past threatens not only Eirlys’s own life, but the lives of Price, the priest she should hate, and August, the prince she left behind. Now, Eirlys must risk all she holds dear to confront the very gods who condemn her and their promise of a fate far crueler than death.</p>";
