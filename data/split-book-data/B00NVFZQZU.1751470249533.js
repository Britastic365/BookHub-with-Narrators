window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Book Four in the best-selling, award-winning BEYOND series.</i> </p> <p><b>She's been looking for the perfect man. She found two.</b> </p> <p>When Rachel Riley sacrificed a life in Eden to protect the O'Kanes, she earned her place in the powerful Sector Four gang. But the former crime princess is tired of being everyone's sweet little sister. It's time for her to get wild, to embrace her fantasies as only an O'Kane can - with a delicious exiled soldier and the gang's wickedly sinful tattoo artist. </p> <p><b>A saint...</b> </p> <p>Lorenzo Cruz is a warrior, taught by his commanding officers in Eden that involvement equals distraction. Emotion is a liability, and desire a sin. In Sector Four, he finds decadence, shameless sex - and his own dark urges. No battle strategy prepared him for how Rachel makes his heart race...or the way his rival for her affections sets his blood on fire. </p> <p><b>...And a sinner.</b> </p> <p>Ace Santana has a dirty reputation and a mind to match, especially where his new lovers are concerned. He's eager to help Cruz embrace his dominant side, and to explore the lines between pleasure and pain with Rachel. But corrupting them quickly becomes an obsession, a need he can't deny - and a love he never imagined. </p> <p>Three hearts on the line means a hundred ways their menage a trois could go wrong. After all, even O'Kanes do forever two-by-two. One of them could be the missing piece that makes them all whole... or a temporary diversion destined for a broken heart.</p>";
