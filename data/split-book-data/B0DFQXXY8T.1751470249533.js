window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Take back your kingdom.</b></p> <p>Unicorns and dragons never mix. For centuries, they've been bitter enemies and their kingdoms at war. But desperate times call for desperate measures. Tanis's beloved older brother and heir to their throne has been slain by a human who continues to flaunt her brother's death.</p> <p>To restore her family's honor, she's willing to make a deal with a unicorn shapeshifter so that she can infiltrate the human kingdom and recapture what was so cruelly taken.</p> <p>Dash Coeur de Noir isn't just any unicorn. As the High King, he's the most hated and feared of his breed, and he's on his own mission when the dragon Tanis crosses his pathâ€”to reclaim his sister's horn that was brutally taken. In the wrong hands, that horn could destroy the fragile peace that has kept the Thirteen Kingdoms from destroying each other.</p> <p>In a world built on magic, blood, and betrayal, no one can trust anyone. With a bounty on their heads and assassins and enemies out to claim them both, they must somehow learn to trust each other or watch their kingdoms burn.</p> <p><i>From #1 </i>New York Times <i>and international bestselling author Sherrilyn Kenyon comes an all-new world unlike anything ever seen before...</i></p>";
