window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>No one does wickedly funny and irresistibly steamy like <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Lynsay Sands - especially in this red-hot romance between a reluctant vampire and the beauty who needs his help. </p> <p><b>Luck be a vampire tonight...</b> </p> <p>When Nicole Phillips agreed to hire a housekeeper, she pictured someone a little frumpy and almost certainly female. Instead, she gets gorgeous, unmistakably male Jake Colson. The man is proving indispensable in the kitchen - and everywhere else. Except Jake might not be a mortal man at all. </p> <p>Who wouldn't want to be a tall, dark, powerful vampire? Jake, for one. He's barely had time to adjust to his new state before he's roped into a family favor. Still, secretly playing bodyguard to sweet, sexy Nicole is turning out to be the wildest ride of his life. First, he'll put a stop to whoever's targeting her. Then he'll prove that this kind of love, and luck, happens only once in an eternity.</p>";
