window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Welcome to the Lilydale Foundation Center... home of second chances. At least, that's what they tell us it is. It's basically a glorified prison and asylum for the deranged with good alibis.</p> <p>When the police pulled me out of my burning home, along with what was left of my Father, I was deemed broken â€” even if I was the reason the fire started.</p> <p>So, here I am at my new home. They think they can save us with their fancy facility. But what insane person decided it was a good idea to put a bunch of young, unhinged people together?</p> <p>It's just asking for trouble.</p> <p>Unhinged is a why-choose dark romance. It contains adult themes, sensitive topics, and is solely intended for mature audiences over 18. It is recommended that listeners check the trigger warnings before diving in. Unhinged is book 1 in the Dance with my Demons series.</p>";
