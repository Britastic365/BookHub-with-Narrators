Brightly-packaged presents. </p> <p><b>It’s definitely not supposed to be about frozen bodies, serial killers, and boyfriends with secrets.</b> </p> <p>Victoria and Kyle are in the midst of a still-blossoming relationship, but she hasn’t told him the truth about herself yet. She’s not ready. Of course, he’s hiding something too. <i>And he doesn’t even know it.</i> Love’s complicated. </p> <p>Then there’s Victoria’s work. Death doesn’t take a holiday, and neither can she. When a father walks into her business wanting a funeral for his missing son, she’s only sure of one thing - the father needs closure, and that’s something she can understand. </p> <p>Then a body turns up, and things go from \"odd grieving father\", to \"murderously strange\" in a heartbeat. </p> <p>With threats mounting, both in her professional and personal life, Victoria must solve a puzzle of death, dolls, and dark obsession. </p> <p><b>If she doesn’t, someone she loves might die.</b></p>";
