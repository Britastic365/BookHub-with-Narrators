Her talent has landed her a spot in an elite FBI program for teens with innate crime-solving abilities, and into some harrowing situations.

Forced deeper into a murderer's psyche than ever before, will the Naturals be able to outsmart the enigmatic killer's brutal mind games before this copycat twists them into his web for good?<br> <br> With her trademark wit, brilliant plotting, and twists that no one will see coming, Jennifer Lynn Barnes will keep readers on the edge of their seats (and looking over their shoulders) as they race through this thrilling novel.</p> <p><b>Praise for </b><b><i>Killer Instinct</i></b> \"A welcome addition to the teen-sleuth genre.\"<br> -<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br> <br> \"Barnes knows how to keep the reader hooked, and fans will be eagerly reaching for this title and clamoring for the next in the series.\"<br> -<i>Booklist</i><br> <br> \"This is a definite purchase for libraries....\"<br> -<i>School Library Journal</i><br> <br> \"Intricately plotted, this novel will keep teens guessing and leave readers eagerly waiting the next installment in The Naturals series.\"</p>";
