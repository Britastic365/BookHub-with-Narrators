window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Warning: This book features a dominant alpha man who will push your boundaries until you beg for more. Listen at your own risk.</b></p> <p>Blake Roberts is falling hard for his old flame and won't stop until Erin is his. He doesn't simply want her body; he wants her submission, her abandon, and the wounded heart she's trying so hard to hide.</p> <p>He wants all of her, and he's pulling out all the stops - in the bedroom and out - until she surrenders.</p> <p>For Erin, what started as a charade has become all too real. She's never experienced anything like the savage bliss she's discovered in Blake's arms. He tests her, dominates her, and if she doesn't gain her freedom, soon he'll own her - body and soul.</p> <p>She has to escape, even if running from Blake feels like running from the only home she's ever known.</p> <p>Cliff-hanger alert: This steamy listen ends in a cliff-hanger. If you don't like being teased, steer clear.</p>";
