He might as well have ushered me to the gates of hell.</p> <p>The Marino family is sadistic. If rumors are true, they’ll own me, use me, control me, and strip me of every freedom I’ve taken for granted. I’ll be a shiny new toy in a dark and deadly underworld.</p> <p>So when my husband drops the bomb that our arranged marriage is only a means to an end, I realize there’s something worse than merely being a possession.</p> <p>My stupid, stupid heart.</p> <p>In the end, the last thing I expected to do was fall in love.</p>";
