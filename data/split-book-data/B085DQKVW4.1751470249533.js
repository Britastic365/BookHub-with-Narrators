window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Escaping hell is nothing compared to the mating fever. One just feels a lot better.</b></p> <p>My name is Calamity. My past is dust, and my future is a life to fight to the death in hell. I never expected this to change, but then, three smoking-hot warriors - a primordial vampire, a fae prince, and a Sváva archangel - arrive in my wrecked world. They claim I'm the lost queen and their fated mate.</p> <p>They come to return me to the great Atlantis to claim my stolen birthright, despite the fact that no one has ever escaped the underworld.</p> <p>I don't trust anyone, but I can't deny the terrifying power awakening inside me...any more than I can deny my fatal attraction to the immortal males who fight with me.</p> <p><b>Excerpt form the book:</b></p> <p>\"What's happening to me?\" I breathed out as I shivered in want.</p> <p>\"You're going into heat,\" Elijah whispered, his eyes shining liquid blue, his face twisting with restraint. \"The mating call is in my blood, too. My control is slipping.\"</p> <p>His words didn't make sense, but it no longer mattered. Lust burned through me like wildfire. In its wake, nothing could survive, except my savage need for this archangel.</p> <p>I must take him raw and hard until he couldn't take it, and then, I'd still have him, marking him as mine over and over. He'd beg and scream, but I still wouldn't stop.</p> <p><b>Warning: </b>This is a full-length reverse harem fantasy romance that features one hell of a hybrid woman warrior and her four powerful mates. It contains battles, explicit love scenes, curses, magic, dark fae, vampires, shifters, fallen angels, and a lot of demon assholes.</p>";
