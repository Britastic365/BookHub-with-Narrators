window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>My whole life, I have been starved.</b></p> <p>Starved of love and starved of affection. My caretaker, Francis, refuses to touch me, and he makes me feel as worthless as dirt.</p> <p>The only love and affection I've ever found are inside the pages of the books he gives me. At least those books make me feel less aloneâ€”less starved. They give me hope that I'll find love of my very own one day.</p> <p>When I finally escape Francis's gilded cage, I stumble upon the Snow Pack. And their Beta may very well just be what I've been looking for my whole life. It's just a shame that he is already taken. Rian, Troy, Jeremy, and Leo won't ever want me. Because they already have each other.</p> <p>So, what need do they have for an Omega like me?</p> <p>Starved <i>is a contemporary Omegaverse about a touch-starved Omega that will take you on an emotional rollercoaster from start to finish. There is no choosing and scenes of MM/MMFM. For mature listeners.</i></p>";
