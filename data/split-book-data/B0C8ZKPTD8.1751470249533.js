window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Three years have passed in Earth’s realm when Ember and her friends finally return from the Otherworld. Eli feels her the moment she steps back, and the beast is far from delighted. Believing for the last three years she was dead, he has become violent and cruel in her absence.</p> <p>Eli’s anger isn’t the only thing she should fear. Ember is at the top of the Unseelie King’s list after breaking her oath with him. No one breaks a vow with King Lars without severe consequences. And Ember will pay.</p> <p>As tension for war mounts between the Seelie and Unseelie, the pressure to find the only weapon that can kill the Seelie Queen—the Sword of Light—takes them to the high cliffs of Greece, where betrayal follows her.</p> <p>But is Ember the answer to the location of the sword? Is she the one to fulfill the prophecy? As usual, nothing is ever what it seems.</p>";
