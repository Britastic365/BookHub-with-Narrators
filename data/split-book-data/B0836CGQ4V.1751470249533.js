window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>RITA Award-winning author Kennedy Ryan delivers the gripping conclusion to the All the King's Men Duet . Ambition. Revenge. Love.</p> <p>Raised to resist. Bred to fight. Survival is in my blood and surrender is never an option. Though surrender is what Maxim Cade demanded of my body and heart, I had other plans. We were fast-burning fascination and combustible chemistry, but the man I trusted with everything was a trickster. A thief who stole my love. If what we had was a lie, why did it feel so real? The man I swore to hate will have it all, and wants me at his side. But power is a game, and we're the pawns and players. Facing insurmountable odds, will we win the world, or will we lose it all?</p>";
