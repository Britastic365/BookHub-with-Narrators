She'll call me daddy.</b></p> <p>As Cami Davis stands in front of me in her nightgown, cheeks blushing and voice quavering, I know what she's come to ask me even before she can muster the courage to speak the words.</p> <p>Did I really mean what I said to her earlier tonight?</p> <p>Would I really take her over my knee and spank her like a naughty little girl?</p> <p>She's a 19-year-old orphan and I'm a billionaire with plans to run for mayor. I shouldn't even be thinking about pulling down her panties and turning that cute little bottom bright red, let alone bending her over the dining room table and claiming her roughly right then and there.</p> <p>But the moment I found her squatting in my newly purchased estate I knew what I needed.</p> <p>Her.</p> <p>Calling me daddy.</p> <p><b>Publisher's Note:</b> <i>Daddy's Property</i> includes spankings and rough, intense sexual scenes. If such material offends you, please don't buy this book.</p>";
