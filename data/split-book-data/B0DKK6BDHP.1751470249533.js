Two gangs are at war, and I'm hungry for survival.</p> <p>Growing up in a broken town doesn't make you a good man. In fact, the North Shore of the Falls has made me merciless.</p> <p>I survive because I'm a good soldier for the North Shore Crew. I'm cool-headed, I never lose sight of my goals, and my only obsession is to wrench our town from the clutches of our sworn enemies, the Kings.</p> <p>Alexandra Delacroix is just a job. Plain and simple. She lives in our neighboring town, in the millionaires' heaven they call Stoneview.</p> <p>The plan is straightforward: charm her, uncover incriminating information about her senator father, and tip the balance of power in our favor.</p> <p>But unlike the other rich girls from Stoneview I use as toys, Alexandra is kind, selfless… sweet. Sickeningly so. A bright pink cupcake with glitter and sprinkles on the icing, that kind of sweet.</p> <p>We have nothing in common. Nothing but the secrets we keep.</p> <p>And before I know it, my priorities change.</p> <p>Before I know it… Alexandra Delacroix is my new obsession.</p> <p><i>This is book two in a series of interconnected standalones.
