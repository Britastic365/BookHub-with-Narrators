window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Having finally reunited, and fought off the Deceiver for now, Mary and Michael race up the Michigan peninsula to meet Astra before police forces catch up with them. But the closer they get, the less Mary is willing to trust a woman who by her own admission will do anything to finish the Deceiver - even if it means killing Michael and Mary to try again in another life. As they face their final battle, Michael's loyalties are tested, making him vulnerable just when Mary needs him most. </p>";
