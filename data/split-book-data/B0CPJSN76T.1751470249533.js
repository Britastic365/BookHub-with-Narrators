She escaped her Tennessee small town, loathsome father, and six brothers eight years ago. Now she escapes life daily via her one-click addiction. However, when a family tragedy forces her to return home, Ashley can’t escape the notice of Drew Runous—local Game Warden, bear wrestler, philosopher, and everyone’s favorite guy. Drew’s irksome philosophizing in particular makes Ashley want to run for the skyscrapers, especially since he can’t seem to keep his exasperating opinions—or his soulful poetry, steadfast support, and delightful hands—to himself.</p> <p>Pretty soon the girl who wanted nothing more than the escape of the big city finds she’s lost her heart in small town Tennessee.</p> <p><i>Beauty and the Mustache is book #4 in the Knitting in the City series, and book #1 in the Winston Brothers series. Each book is a standalone, full length (110k words), contemporary romantic comedy novel, and follows the misadventures and exploits of seven friends in Chicago, all members of the same knitting group.</i></p> <p><b>Truth or Beard, Book #2 in the Winston Brothers Series</b></p> <p><i>Beards, brothers, and bikers!

She can’t stand him, and she’s pretty sure he can’t stand the sight of her…</p> <p>But after a case of mistaken identity, Jessica finds herself in a massive confusion kerfuffle. Jessica James has spent her whole life paralyzed by the fantasy of Beau and her assumptions of Duane’s disdain; therefore she’s unprepared for the reality that is Duane’s insatiable interest, as well as his hot hands and hot mouth and hotter looks. </p> <p>When Jessica finds herself drawn to the man who was always her adversary, how much of her level-headed heart is she willing to risk?</p> <p><i>Truth or Beard is book #2 in the Winston Brothers series. Each book is a standalone, full-length, contemporary romantic comedy novel, and follows the romantic exploits and adventures of one of the six Winston Brothers.</i></p>";
