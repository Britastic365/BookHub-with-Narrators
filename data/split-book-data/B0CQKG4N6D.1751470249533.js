But they aren’t my only concern anymore, because the gods of old are waking, and now one of them has their sights set on us.<br> <br> No matter what fate throws our way, I <i>will</i> rescue my family, even if it costs me everything.</p> <p><b>Montana:</b><br> I fear this game will end in blood.<br> <br> I’m so deeply involved in Erik Belvedere’s cunning plans, and the cost is rising by the hour. I’ll do anything I can to protect my family, but this ritual only ends one way.<br> <br> A human bride for a vampire prince.<br> <br> And the game is getting more deadly. Elite vampires are showing up dead in the city, and I’m sure I’ve seen the killer before…<br> <br> If only I could act on logic, maybe this wouldn’t be so impossible. But I’m starting to crave the monster who holds me captive.<br> <br> If I can’t break free of his allure, how will I ever save myself and those I love?</p> <p>***This is a dark, fantasy romance series by the authors of Zodiac Academy with all the enemies to lovers vibes – don’t go expecting a sweet vampire with sparkling skin and a tendency to watch you sleeping. These vampires are savage and bloodthirsty, and the slayer who hunts them will stab first and ask questions later.</p> <p>This war-torn fantasy world is a brutal bi*ch and only those 18+ have a chance at surviving the darkness lurking in this audio. There’s no well-meaning vampires snacking on Bambies instead of babies, and if they get their teeth into you, you’ll be damn lucky to escape with your life and panties intact. So grab hold of your slayer blade (wooden stakes have too many splinters) and get ready to defy the gods, because this is going to be one helluva ride***.</p>";
