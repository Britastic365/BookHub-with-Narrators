window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>When I—along with my best friend and his big purple monster boyfriend—come across a fortress-like raider camp while journeying across the monster-infested Wastes, we stop to deliver a message.</b></p> <p>Somehow, that simple pit stop turns into a seemingly impossible quest to get this camp's missing leader out of the prison where he's being held and forced to fight monsters and other humans. I know exactly where it is because I've been there.</p> <p>Problem is, I'm making this journey with the prickliest and most arrogant guy I've ever met, who seems to hate me on sight. Oh, and he's also half-monster. So there's that. And he's in love with a raider who definitely does not love him back, and he seems determined to take it out on me. So there's also that.</p> <p>I'm not going to rise to his childish insults and barbed words. I'm not. I'm also going to try very hard to ignore how mind-numbingly beautiful he is, even when he's scowling at me.</p> <p>The longer we're out here together, the more I learn about my prickly half-monster companion Moth. I realize there's a reason he's so closed off and angry. There's a reason he hates everyone.</p> <p>There are secrets he's been keeping, and when I find out what they are, I want to do everything in my power to help him—even though he's telling me he can't be helped.</p> <p><i>Moth </i>is book five of the Monstrous series, a post-apocalyptic m/m fantasy series that features monsters and human men falling in love. It is best to listen to the series in order.</p> <p>Contains mature content.</p>";
