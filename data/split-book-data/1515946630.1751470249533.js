Not thrown away by her people, but rather someone who created a new life for herself when the old one died. </p> <p>When she rescues one of the mysterious winged horses, a creature straight out of myth, from those who would enslave him, Eva opens the door to something her chosen people want more than anything else. An alliance. </p> <p>Now, sent deep into the Highlands and guarded by one of the Warlord's most trusted warriors, Eva will have to brave the terrors that wait there. Someone is sowing the seeds of dissent upon which war turns. Failure will lead to death, but success may bring revelations she's not ready to face. </p> <p>The balance of power is shifting in the Broken Lands. Those who survive will need to adapt quickly to the ever-changing landscape. Choosing her friends wisely has never been so important.</p>";
