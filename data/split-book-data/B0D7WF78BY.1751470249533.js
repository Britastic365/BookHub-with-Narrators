window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Jazz Masters is a werewolf with a day job. Living in fear of the monster that lives inside her, she’s created a safe, if lonely world where she can control her darker half. That world comes crashing down around her when she crosses paths with a pack of werewolves who recognize what she is–a rogue she-wolf with no pack to protect her. Threatened and afraid for her life Jazz turns to the only group that might be able to help her–the Guardians.</p> <p>One look at Jazz is all it takes for the Guardian’s resident risk-taker, pilot, and playboy Jason Waters to know he’s interested. Not even the revelation that she’s a werewolf deters him from his new mission–Protecting Jazz from everything and everyone, including her dark side.</p> <p>With the pack closing in, Jazz must make a choice–surrender to her fear, or fight for her life and a chance at love with the only man who’d die to protect her.</p> <p>**Publisher’s Note–This book was previously released as On Jason’s Watch</p>";
