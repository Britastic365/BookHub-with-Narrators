Offered a deal to escape the death penalty, Merrick agrees to lead Devlin, a local wilderness guide, and two lawmen to her location on the mountain. Cut off from the rest of the world by a deadly blizzard, Devlin and his team have no choice but to follow Merrick into a horrific storm, scale an unforgiving mountain, and march directly into a well-laid trap....</p> <p>Will the deal with the devil save the girl or doom them all?</p>";
