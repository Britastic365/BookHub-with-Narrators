window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Making a name for myself as a Villain in Panopolis is hard work. Six months ago, my boyfriend broke me out of jail. Now he's spending most of his time defending our turf against other Villains he accidentally freed along with me. And my new psychic powers are not only impossible to control, but they're also giving me migraines. </p> <p>But it's not all doom and gloom. My skills are improving every day, and Raul - aka the Mad Bombardier - and I have never been happier. That is, until my first solo job is interrupted by a mysterious woman who tells me that Raul has been kidnapped by a ruthless new Villain. The only way to free him is to do a job for Maggot, a man with scary ideas and an even scarier superpower. </p> <p>I can't go to the cops or a Hero for help. Odds are they wouldn't listen to me anyway. If I fail, Raul will be killed. If I succeed, we'll both be bound to a man who'll stop at nothing to put Panopolis on the path to civil war. It looks like the only way to win is to take out the competition. </p>";
