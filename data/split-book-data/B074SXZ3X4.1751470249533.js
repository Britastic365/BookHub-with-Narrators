But the treaty guaranteeing peace will die with him unless he wins the true love of a woman and she bears him a dragonling. When a fiery redheaded witch comes along with plans of her own, 500 years of guarding his heart and opening his bed might not be enough to protect him. </p> <p>Because love is magic...and the fate of the mortal and immortal worlds depends on Rosalyn and Leonidas not only opening their hearts but surviving a love that's true.... </p> <p>Contains mature themes. </p>";
