window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It’s not the size of the stick that matters, but how well he handles it…Thanks to an epic playoffs loss and a somewhat regrettable bachelorette party video starring half the team and a can of whipped cream, Buffalo Tempest captain Roscoe LeGrand is on serious PR duty this summer. His assignment? Organize a youth hockey clinic and clean up the team’s tarnished image before the season’s first face-off.</p> <p></p> <p>But one look at the hot-as-hell hockey mom storming the ice, and Roscoe’s thoughts slide right back into the gutter…Ally Heinz is afraid of everything—with good reason. Three years ago, her husband died in a workplace accident, leaving Ally behind with their only child and a mountain of grief. Now, keeping her child safe is all that matters. Letting the kid play hockey? With all that hard, slippery ice and no onsite medical team? Not happening.</p> <p></p> <p>If only the sweet, sexy NHL player in charge wasn’t so good at charming the pants off her. Um, literally…Despite Ally’s reservations, it’s not long before her kid’s rocking the rink, and Roscoe’s rocking her world, unlocking pleasures Ally has denied herself for years. But hat tricks in the bedroom will only get him so far. When it comes to winning the hockey mom’s wounded heart, Roscoe’s going to need a lot more than a big, hard stick…BIG HARD STICK is a sexy, steamy, single mom romance and the third book in the Buffalo Tempest series. If you like red-hot, dirty-mouthed hockey players, smart and sassy women who aren't afraid to put their men against the boards, and a big, hilarious helping of bromance, then you don't want to miss this lineup!</p>";
