window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>\"What a pretty flower to keep locked in a big, rocky tower.\"</i></b></p> <p>Nineteen years ago, I was plucked from the heart of a bloody massacre that spared nobody else.</p> <p><i>Small. Fragile. An enigma.</i></p> <p>Now ward to a powerful High Master who knows too much and says too little, I lead a simple life, never straying from the confines of an imaginary line I've drawn around the castle grounds.</p> <p><i>Stay within. Never leave.</i></p> <p>Out there, the monsters lurk. Inside, I'm <i>safe</i>...though at a cost far greater than the blood I drip into a goblet daily. Toxic, unreciprocated love for a man who's utterly unavailable.</p> <p>My savior. My protector.</p> <p><i>My almost executioner.</i></p> <p>I can't help but be enamored with the arcane man who holds the power to pull my roots from the ground. When voracious beasts spill across the land and threaten to fray the fabric of my tailored existence, the petals of reality will peel back to reveal an ugly truth. But in a castle puddled with secrets, none are greater than the one I've kept from myself.</p> <p>No tower is tall enough to protect me from the horror that tore my life to shreds.</p> <p><b><i>To Bleed a Crystal Bloom</i></b><b> is a dark Rapunzel reimagining full of immersive imagery and breathtaking angst. </b></p>";
