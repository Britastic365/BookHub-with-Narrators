window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>One of PopSugar's Top Summer Reads of 2021!</b></p> <p><b>An ordinary summer goes royally awry when a prince and princess move next door, bringing their handsome bodyguard with them, from </b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>best-selling author Karina Halle.</b></p> <p>Piper Evans: elementary school teacher by day - avid romance reader and anonymous podcaster by night. She has a quiet, reclusive life, taking care of her mother, who lives with mental illness, avoiding her regrettable ex, who bartends in town, and trying to make inroads in the tight-knit island community that still sees her, five years in, as an outsider. </p> <p>And she's happy with how things are - really - until British royals rent the property next to hers and their brooding bodyguard decides she's a security threat. Piper quickly realizes that one person's fairy tale is an ordinary woman's nightmare as a media frenzy takes over the island and each run-in with Harrison Cole is hotter and more confusing than the last. But beneath Harrison's no-nonsense exterior lies a soft heart, one that could tempt a woman who's sworn off attachments into believing in white knights.</p> <p>But when Piper finds herself smack in the middle of a royal scandal that rocks the island, she'll need more than Harrison's strong arms to shield her - she'll have to do a little rescuing herself. With careers, hearts, and friendships on the line, Piper and Harrison will have to decide what they're willing to give up for a chance at their own happily-ever-after.</p>";
