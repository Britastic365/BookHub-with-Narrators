window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>All his other Harem brothers have found their one true love, and they are spectacular princesses.</b></p> <p>Not Valor’s girl. Veila is the definition of evil.</p> <p>Not the kind of girl for whom a guy falls. Especially a stand-up guy like Valor. He’s not interested in her sexy glow, her pretty hair, or her glowing eyes.</p> <p>No. Valor only wants one thing for his fated princess.</p> <p>Death.</p> <p>But it’s kind of hard to kill someone you’ve been genetically engineered to love. And Veila not only has total control over him, but also Harem Station. The only way Valor can get Harem Station back is to use the soul-mate bond against her.</p> <p>Valor has to make Veila believe their bond is true, that his feelings are real, and that he is willing to sell out his brothers, hand over all of Harem Station’s secrets, and leave his old life behind to help her get what she wants. But it’s never going to happen. Valor will never love Veila.</p> <p>Ever.</p> <p>He’d rather die trying to kill her than spend one moment as her puppet king. There’s just one problem.</p> <p>The soul-mate bond goes both ways.</p> <p><i>Veiled Vixen</i> features an army of pissed-off princesses, five brothers facing their past, a station filled with ruthless, rebelling outlaws, and a lesson in what matters. It’s a love story about revenge, and hate, and regrets - but also forgiveness, loyalty, family, and having the courage to see the truth behind the veil.</p> <p>Includes a special bonus note from the author.</p>";
