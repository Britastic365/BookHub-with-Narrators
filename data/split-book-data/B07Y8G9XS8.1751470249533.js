window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After she takes a job at the Crooked Creek ranch, Melody Jackson quickly hits it off with handsome cowboy Luc Girard, and it isn't long before she is begging shamefully for more as the ridiculously sexy rodeo champion gives her the ride of her life. But Luc is the kind of man who expects to be obeyed, and when Melody's disregard for his instructions puts her in danger, she soon learns the hard way that he will not hesitate to punish her bare bottom both inside and out.</p> <p>Luc's stern correction leaves Melody blushing crimson yet deeply aroused, and her need for him only increases as he claims her ever more thoroughly over the coming weeks. But when she is finally forced to reveal the secret she has been keeping from her employers, will Melody end up losing not only her job but also the man who has both mastered her body and tamed her heart?</p> <p><b>Publisher's Note:</b> <i>Tamed on the Ranch</i> is a stand-alone sequel to <i>Taming His Cowgirl</i>. It includes spankings and sexual scenes. If such material offends you, please don't buy this audiobook.</p>";
