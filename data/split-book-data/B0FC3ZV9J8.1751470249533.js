window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Will Murphy spends his down time doing subversive cross-stitch, crafting saucy baked goods for the romance book club he attends with his Nana, and desperately trying to hide the fact that he's been in love with Vanessa Woodbridge for, well, ever. For years, he's been content to wear the best friend label. But suddenly it's starting to chafe, right when Vanessa needs a trusted friend more than ever.</p> <p>Vanessa Woodbridge wants to be a hedge witch more than anything, but her chances of becoming one are laughable. Her father's pride stands between her and her dream of leaving her barista job behind in favor of crafting helpful potions and magical edibles at Wicked Brews. The Woodbridge patriarch has forbidden her from a career path that is, in his opinion, beneath their magical family legacy. She might not care about his feelings, but without his signature, Vanessa can't sign up for the classes she desperately needs to learn essential hedge witchery.</p> <p>She's ready to give up, but with Will at her back, she finds the courage to fight for what she wants. She's never been able to count on her dad, but she can count on her best friend. Will's her rock. He would never crumble.</p> <p>Only Will feels like he's doing exactly that. He's falling apart inside and he's not sure how long he can keep up the façade of the calm, platonic, best friend. But for Vanessa? He'd do anything to help her get her dream...</p> <p>Even if it costs him the one thing he cherishes most.</p> <p>Her.</p>";
