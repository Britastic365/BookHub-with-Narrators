window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I abandon all hope that my demigods will come for me.</p> <p>In Hell's Academy, it's either kill or be eaten. Demons turn violence into an art form, and they've marked me as their newest victim.</p> <p>A charismatic archdemon offers me a way out of the pit. His price: spend one night with him and his three dukes. They don't want to conquer my heart, but they have every intention of riding my body.</p> <p>I'm no longer the Marigold my demigods once fell in love with. I've become a nightmarish monster bred in an inferno. Yet when my mates find me, they insist I'm still their beautiful monster. Now and forever.</p> <p>Too bad the truth is dirtier than they could ever imagine.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
