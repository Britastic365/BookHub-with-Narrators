window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>I’m finally in control of my magic...and it’s much stronger than my Coven realizes.</b></p> <p>That’s not the only secret I’m keeping. I made a deal with a fairy: Her secrets for some of mine. Except I have no idea how to deliver on my oath and crossing the Fae is suicidal. Tennessee knows I’m up to something, but not even my soulmate can help me now, especially when being together is against the law.</p> <p>The answers to my problems lie within the Book of Shadows - which no one has seen for centuries.</p> <p>The quest to find it takes us deep into the Old Lands, where the magic is ancient, the creatures are far more than human, and each task is more dangerous than the last. Without the book we can’t rescue Henley or save the world from demon destruction. It’s time to lay everything on the line, including our lives. Because I’m either going to find the book...or die trying.</p> <p><b>The magic continues in </b><b><i>The Rebel Witch</i></b><b>, the third book in the adventure-filled Elemental Magic series that's leaving readers begging for more! </b></p> <p><b>Pick up </b><b><i>The Rebel Witch</i></b><b> and unlock the magic today!</b></p>";
