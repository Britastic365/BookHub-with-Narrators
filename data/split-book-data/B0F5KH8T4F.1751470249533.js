But of course, when he returns home for his sister’s wedding, there she is…<br> Nope, not forgotten at all.<br> <br> Of course Jack the Grump has shown up for his sister’s wedding, and by the way he looks at Harper, um, clearly her sins aren’t forgiven. So what—she’s sooo over her best-friend’s brooding, dark oldest brother. Really.<br> <br> Then a bridesmaid goes missing.<br> <br> And sure, Harper is a journalist who knows how to sniff out truth, but the clock is ticking and there’s only one person who can help…Perfect. No problem. She’s not going to fall for her childhood crush again. <i>Promise.</i><br> <br> Yes, Jack can admit that Harper’s not the girl he used to call Pigtails anymore. She’s all grown up…but he’s not going to get burned again.
