window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Fans of Bridgerton and Game of Thrones will love this brand new dark fantasy romance.</p> <p>The guards arrive at my humble cottage with a ridiculous offer: Come to an exclusive and mysterious isle to compete for the hand of a royal husband. Enjoy a week of glittering balls, dancing, ostentatious wealth…and a royal hunt. All I have to do is to get rejected by a prince, and I’ll be sent home with a pot of money. My father tells me it’s dangerous. He begs me not to go. But I'd do anything for him, I could change our lives with this money.</p> <p>But when I arrive on the Roaring Isle, I meet the royals who ordered this marriage market. But there’s no prince charming here. These men are monsters.</p> <p>Powerful.</p> <p>Toxic.</p> <p>Bloodthirsty.</p> <p>In the dark and treacherous wilderness, they are the hunters and me and the other would be royal wives… we’re the prey.</p> <p>Not all of us will survive a hunt so wicked.</p> <p>This is the first book of the Cursed Royals series. Profane language and certain situations may be disturbing to some listeners. Enjoy.</p>";
