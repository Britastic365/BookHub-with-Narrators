window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>What happens when magical enemies wind up in a real-life </b><b><i>Freaky Friday?</i></b></p> <p>Witch Blair Thornrose has spent her life working in her family's magical bookshop. But when the magic begins failing, the only thing that can save it is for Blair to marry. The one way that witches know how to do that—throw a witchy ballroom dance to find the most eligible suitor.</p> <p>But Blair has a power that makes most men run for cover—all of them except the brutally handsome and terribly arrogant Devlin Ross, that is.</p> <p>Wizard inventor Devlin Ross has never gotten over Blair Thornrose. The two dated in high school, but things ended badly between them. When he discovers that she must find a husband, Devlin's jealous. He wants Blair badly, but there's a reason why they can't be together—a secret that Devlin refuses to share.</p> <p>When a magical spell goes terribly wrong and Devlin and Blair switch powers, Blair is furious. But Devlin makes her a deal—he will help her win the man of her dreams if she helps him build his latest invention. This is too big an opportunity for Blair to give up. But will Devlin reveal the secret that tore them apart, or will he push Blair into the arms of another man and give her up forever?</p> <p><i>If you love sisterhood, romances that sweep you off your feet, magical bookstores, and loving families, then you'll adore the second book in the Seven Suitors for Seven Witches series.</i></p>";
