window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>She's in high heels; he wears hiking boots. Can these two opposites make romance in Metlin work?</b></p> <p>Tayla McKinnon is not a small-town girl. The fashion blogger moved to Metlin with two goals in mind: help her friend start a bookstore, and have a little fun. A year later, Tayla has made new friends, successfully launched INK, and is ready for a new challenge. Too bad she can't get a certain rock-climbing comic book geek off her mind.</p> <p>Jeremy Allen has been playing the long game with Tayla, even though the avid outdoorsman was certain she was the one from the minute he set eyes on her. They may have different tastes, but their chemistry is undeniable.</p> <p>When a job opportunity from a new fashion start-up lands in her inbox, Tayla takes it as a sign. She's not meant for a small town, even though her best friend and her inconvenient crush are trying to convince her otherwise.</p> <p>Jeremy can't believe Tayla would be willing to leave her new life behind, but maybe he's been playing it too cool. Summer in Metlin can sizzle, which gives Jeremy an excuse to turn up the heat.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
