window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Catawampus (adj.): 1.) Fierce, savage 2.) Askew, awry. (Merriam-Webster Dictionary).</p> <p>It’s a cold and snowy Christmas Eve in the rowdy mining town of Deadwood in the Dakota Territory. Rather than enjoy some drinks in front of a warm fire with her friends, contracted Slayer Clementine Johanssen has her horse saddled and weapons packed to head out into the hills and hunt down some deadly scallywags—alone. When her friends catch wind of her intentions, they set out to waylay her long enough to change her way of thinking...in spite of her mule-headedness.</p> <p>Reminiscent of Dickens’ <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, this catawampus tale will add a heartening dose of fun and camaraderie to your holiday!</p> <p><b>Note: </b>This is book 3.5 of the Deadwood Undertaker Series.</p>";
