window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A lot can change in the years after high school. But a lot can stay the same too. For Chelsie Blake, it’s both.</p> <p>Mischief Motors is the most elite private car service in Las Vegas, and half-sisters Chelsie and Normandy Blake are its co-owners. They don't always see eye-to-eye on how to run the business, and they especially don't agree with Chelsie's attraction to one of their new employees—rugged mechanic Noah Thompson. He also happens to be Chelsie’s former high school crush, who embarrassingly shot her down once upon a time, and never really knew she existed. Let’s just say he knows now. Chelsie has a long history of loving and leaving since getting her heart broken in high school, but this time might be different. She may just have caught herself a keeper if she can let go of the hurtful past, and get around her sister.</p> <p>Book 2 of the Drive Me Wild Series is an enemies-to-lovers/forbidden love contemporary novel for listeners who like a little steam, a side of humor, and a dash of drama with their romance. The series features stand-alone stories of Mischief Motors' women and the men who think they can handle them.</p>";
