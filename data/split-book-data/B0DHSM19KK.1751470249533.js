window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>We weren't supposed to kiss... again. Is it still a second chance when our first one was a secret?</b></p> <p>Rewind: In high school, I was Little Miss Brainy Rebel Girl to my twin's athletic Mr. Popularity. That also meant I avoided wading into the dating pool. Like a shark, it didn't help that my protective brother probably scared away potential suitors.</p> <p>Fast forward: He's engaged, but our parents won't let him tie the knot until I find a boyfriend. Now, he has guys lining up to date me. This only becomes an issue when his best friend, Redd, gets a hero's welcome when he returns to play hockey for the Nebraska Knights.</p> <p>Pause: Little does my brother know that Redd and I kissed on a senior year camping trip. After that, I swore off smooching forever. But I get looped into helping him fundraise for our old high school's hockey team, and he and his adorable secret move into my grandmother's old house.</p> <p>We end up spending a lot of time together. Making pancakes, playing flashlight tag, going to the lake... The problem is we despise each other, or so I thought. Will things between us fizzle or will there be fireworks this 4th of July?</p> <p><i>This is a clean, sweet, closed-door hockey romcom with lots of sweet kisses and a happily ever after.</i></p>";
