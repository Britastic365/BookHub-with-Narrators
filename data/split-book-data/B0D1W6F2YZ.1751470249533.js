Valentina's hate for Kaderyn's arrogance is enough to draw the attention of absent gods. The two are forced on a quest for survival across an island of deceiving fae, dangerous monsters, and meddling, rhyming pixies that won't shut up. But that hate soon transforms into a desire neither expects as she lights a path through his darkness, and his shadows start leading her home.</p> <p>The darkness of the Hunt is going to find out exactly what the light of Summer is made of.</p> <p>Dancing with Darkness is a deliciously slow-burn fantasy romance. The heat and court intrigue ramp up as the series continues.
