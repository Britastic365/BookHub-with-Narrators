No matter how hard I try to stay out of the pandemonium unfolding around my city, I keep getting pulled into the thick of things. So the bills are piling up, our reputations hang in the balance, and we have no new customers. I can almost see the writing on the wall. My dream will crash and burn.</p> <p>To top it all off, my tracking skills are acting up, confusing me and throwing me for a loop when I least expect it.</p> <p>Despite all of this, I can’t turn away from the chaos that threatens to turn St. Louis into a Skew warzone, and I keep getting deeper and deeper into the awful scheme that the power-hungry werewolves and vampires that rule the city have concocted.</p> <p>And as I become the center of their deranged plot, I know I have no other choice but to fight them. I just hope I don’t lose myself in the process.</p> <p><b>If you enjoy K.F.
