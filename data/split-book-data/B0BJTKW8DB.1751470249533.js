window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The Emerald Lake Asylum is not a place most desire to go. Nineteen-year-old Skylenna, however, made a promise that she must keep. Once hired, she has only one purpose—prove to the council that barbaric treatments, such as waterboarding, scalding baths, and beatings, are no longer the answer. But that all takes pause when she meets the source of terror in the asylum. A patient with a split personality—on one side, he’s the bloodthirsty genius Dessin. On the other, a hidden persona that is buried deep in his subconscious.</p> <p>When Dessin is caught in an attempted cell break, he faces execution if Skylenna can’t bring out his core personality and reveal his humanity. She has 90 days to save his life, and the only way to do that is to let him consume her into his world of moves, countermoves, and master puppeteering.</p> <p>With each passing day, their bond deepens, a forbidden attraction forming against her best judgment. Little by little, Skylenna uncovers the sinister secrets of his past that turned him into the monster everyone else fears. And Dessin proves to have one weakness despite the terrifying, indestructible persona he presents to the world: <i>her</i>.</p>";
