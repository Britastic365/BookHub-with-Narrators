window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>I'd always thought bad boys were sexy, but this was taking it to the extreme. </b></p> <p>Clearly, I had issues. After becoming obsessed with death, the angels came for me, and then I ended up in Hell. Oddly, that sounds a lot worse than it really is. Don't get me wrong, the demons in this place are pretty annoying, but there are a few perks. </p> <p>At <i>least </i>four of them. </p> <p>Satan, Lucifer, Beelzebub, and Samyaza. </p> <p>I left everything behind to help change the world. My big plan was to fight back, to stand up for what I believed in. Instead, I'm useless. A failure. </p> <p>I thought we were supposed to be a united front. I thought my guys would be at my side for the rest of eternity. I thought we had something special. Unfortunately, it's not going to be that easy. If I want this, I'm going to have to fight for it. </p> <p>But the heart wants what it wants. </p> <p>And mine is rooting for evil. </p> <p><b><i>For Love of Evil </i></b><b>is a full-length novel with no cliff-hanger ending. This series includes multiple love interests, with some M/M themes. Graphic language, adult situations, and potentially triggering violence that are suitable for a mature audience are included.</b></p> <p><b>Be warned: Everything you thought you knew about the world, religion, and death will be pulled apart, twisted around, and put back together in ways you will not expect.</b></p>";
