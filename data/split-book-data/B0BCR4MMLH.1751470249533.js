window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A girl asks her best friend to pretend to be her fiancé and falls for him hard.</p> <p>That wasn’t Louise’s plan. Her plan was to prove that everything her parents ever said about her was wrong. And since that included that no one would ever love her, when the hottest guy ever asked her to marry him after two dates, she said yes.</p> <p>Lou’s plan might have worked if the hot guy didn’t ghost her after she told her parents to expect him at their next family get-together. So, what choice did she have but to instead ask her way too sexy best friend to pretend to be her fiancé? </p> <p>And then there was that one-bed situation…</p> <p>And him defending her from her family at every turn…</p> <p>Yeah, falling hard for him was not the plan. Nor was it the end of the story. Because when her rich, football-playing fiancé shows up at her family’s estate unannounced, and her parents like him more, she needs to make a choice.</p> <p>Surely the woman who agreed to marry a guy after two dates will make a good decision this time, right? There’s no way she would choose her parent’s approval over the perfect guy, would she? </p> <p>But if she did, could the two of them remain friends? And if they could, could they then find their way back to love? Listen to this sweet, funny, twisting romance to find out. </p> <p><b>Note: This book is a part of the author's Love Is Love Collection, meaning that it is available as a spicy romance in </b><b><i>My Weakness</i></b><b>, a wholesome romance in </b><b><i>Going Far</i></b><b>, a steamy wolf shifter romance in </b><b><i>The Fae’s Wolf</i></b><b>, and a male/male romance in </b><b><i>Asking for Trouble</i></b><b>.</b></p> <p><b>This anthology includes:</b></p> <p></p> <ul> <li><b><i>I Don't Date My Tutor</i></b></li> <li><b><i>I Don't Date Football Players</i></b></li> <li><b><i>I Don't Date My Best Friend</i></b></li> </ul>";
