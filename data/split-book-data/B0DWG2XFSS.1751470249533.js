window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Since the day she married her husband, Lo Harper has watched her happy ever after slip away before her eyes. Feeling lost and alone, she’s stumbling through life, each day getting longer, harder, and more hopeless. She doesn’t know how much longer she can hold on. Until she meets a stranger who ironically becomes a lifeline after he nearly runs her down. He’s charming, kind, and he doesn’t pry. He’s just there, making Lo smile, distracting her, if only briefly. Because she will always return to the pain. To the heartbreak. To the unshakable guilt.</p> <p>Luke Williamson is successful, content, and he keeps his relationships with women uncomplicated. But his simple, carefree life is turned up on its head the night a young woman walks out in front of his car. Drawn to each other for very different reasons, Lo and Luke forge an unlikely friendship that they both come to rely on. And yet while Luke shares his life with Lo, he knows she’s keeping hers from him. And as her truth unfolds, Luke slowly realizes that for Lo to have her happy ever after, he must sacrifice his own. So he has to make the ultimate decision. Keep Lo in his life as she is, a broken, shadow of a woman. Or walk away and let her heal.</p>";
