window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Sofiya wants love, marriage, and children. But she can't have that with the alien gladiators who've raided her facility...or can she?</b> </p> <p>Sofiya Petrov is stuck in a stand-off with the most celebrated gladiator-athletes in the entire four sectors. Two muscle-bound celebrities who insist on living and working in the same small section of the Swirl with her — a section they each declare is legally their property. </p> <p>And neither side is willing to back down. </p> <p>And she’s not attracted to the winners of season 25 of Gladiator Nation and their tree-trunk thighs and acres of shiny scales undulating over hard abs. Because that’s just wrong. Right? Creekan and humans aren’t even breeding compatible. </p> <p>They’re arrogant. </p> <p>They want to share her bunk, but they don’t want her as anything more than a temporary pleasure mate, which is just…insulting. </p> <p>And yet, why didn’t anyone warn her that her heart could be in jeopardy in this situation? </p> <p>Author's note: This is book three in the series, but can be listened to as a standalone. Be prepared to meet new friends and revisit old favorites....</p>";
