She has fought the enforced boundaries of being the lone Jamenson daughter and Redwood Pack princess, but it is the potential future with the dark wolf in her path that threatens everything she thought she desired. </p> <p>Logan Anderson's own darkness provided the reasoning for his abandonment of his former pack, the Talons. Now, newly accepted into the Redwood Pack, this jade-eyed wolf and all she represents could be his undoing. </p> <p>In this final installment of the Redwood Pack, unimaginable tragedy strikes, and the two wolves who have fought the longest for their independence now face the uncertainty of fate and the epic battle that could end the war...and their lives. </p>";
