window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Willa: All my dreams are gone in the blink of an eye after an accident leaves me unable to compete anymore. Not just from the injuries but also the fear of it happening again. Content with my life in the aftermath, I spend my days working on my parent’s ranch and my nights with my closest friends. A drunken concert leads me to meeting a man who makes my body come alive in ways I never knew were possible. He keeps his last name a secret; and wants to build a relationship between us before he tells me who he is. When the truth finally comes out, will what we have built so far be strong enough to keep us together, or will it break the only good thing in my life?</p> <p>Nash: A lifetime spent in the service is overshadowed by the PTSD that plagues me. That same PTSD bleeds into my personal life, not allowing me to make a solid connection to any woman who graces my bed. Now the CEO of Holding’s Oil Company, my days are spent schmoozing clients and my nights are spent hanging out with my brothers. A fiery redhead barrels into a guy’s night, drunk off her pert butt, and precedes to throw up and catch my attention all in the same breath. Learning who she is stops me from telling her who I am, with the fear of losing her before anything can even start. When she finds out, can we weather the storm the connection might bring, or will it tear us apart?</p>";
