window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>From the USA Today Best-Selling Author comes a sensually soulful contemporary romance of a fated love between a bitter, reclusive rap star and the heart-of-gold single mom who inspires him to believe in forever…</i></b></p> <p><b>EVERY LOVE STORY WANTS A FOREVER AFTER.</b></p> <p>Alonzo “Zo” Taylor was the number one worldwide hip-hop artist when a sex scandal destroyed it all. Now five years later, he’s become an angry recluse, preferring solitude and loneliness to the full life he once enjoyed. Until he encounters a teen who reminds him of his past. And a woman that makes him believe in a future.</p> <p>Sage Parker, a single mother and bartender in Las Vegas is inexplicably drawn to the handsome stranger who frequents her lounge utterly alone. Decidedly celibate and too busy keeping her wayward teenager on the right side of the law to think about love, she resists the gravitational pull of Alonzo. After an unexpected incident forces them into close quarters, Sage and Alonzo decide to take a chance on forever.</p> <p>Inspired to create and perform again, Alonzo wants the fiercely independent Sage by his side as he faces the family and the world he left behind. As challenges confront them, Alonzo worries Sage may be unable to embrace all it means to be with him. Blindsided by the magnitude of his star power, Sage is thrust into a spotlight and a life she never wanted. And Sage begins to doubt their love story will end in the forever after they both so desire.</p> <p><b>Note: Each book in the FANtasy series stands alone, and can be enjoyed in any order.</b></p>";
