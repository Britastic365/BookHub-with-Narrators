window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Once upon a time, Caven Hunt saved my life. We were only kids, but the trauma of that day destroyed us both. Years later, he didn't recognize me when a one-night stand unexpectedly reconnected us. And nine months later, when I left our newborn daughter on his doorstep, I didn't recognize myself either.</p> <p>The darkness doesn't always win, though. It took four agonizing years for me to find myself againâ€”years during which our daughter grew up without a mother.</p> <p>It was never my intention to take her away from him. I simply wanted to be part of her life. However, one look at me, and Caven was ready for war.</p> <p>As we battled, caught in the crossfire of our past and present, the line between love and hate began to blur. Just as I started to believe we could rewrite our history together, secrets from the past threatened to shatter the family we had fought so hard to rebuild.</p>";
