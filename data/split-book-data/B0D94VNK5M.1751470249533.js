window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I'm a hot mess single mom with no time for players…or anything else. He's a wounded NHL star stuck in the small town he's fought to escape. So we strike a deal to become roomies—Aaron will babysit my little boy to help me through the busiest catering season of the year. In exchange, I'll give him a place to heal away from his overbearing family. The problem? We hate each other (and lust after each other) in equal measure.</p> <p>I expect living with my nemesis will be annoying at best, excruciating at worst. Until the night I come home emotionally broken from a fight with my ex and Aaron holds me while I cry. He just...holds me. And then I drag him upstairs to my bedroom. Soon, this man is turning my world upside down in the best way. Aaron makes me feel beautiful, special, maybe even...lovable? But can my tender heart survive falling for a man who's determined to put my beloved hometown in his rear view mirror?</p>";
