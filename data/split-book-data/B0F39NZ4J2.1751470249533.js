window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>For the past eleven years, Mina has remained silent for fear of her mother's constant abuse. But when she's suddenly let out of the locked basement to attend high school, a whole new set of fears threatens to suffocate her.</b></p> <p>Stepping into the outside world is terrifying. The fear of speaking, of having a panic attack, of standing out in any way, looms over her. Yet, the unexpected kindness of certain male students and teachers leaves her confused and wary and wishing she could speak.</p> <p>Why are they constantly by her side? What happens when they find out she's not seventeen but twenty-one? And why was she feeling desire for the first time in her life, and not for just one person, but seven?</p> <p>Silent Desires <i>is the first part of a duet and ends in a cliffhanger. It's a why-choose, MFMM+, romance novel with dark themes. No MM/FF, cheating, or other woman drama. No abuse comes from within the harem. The FMC will not have to choose between her love interests.
