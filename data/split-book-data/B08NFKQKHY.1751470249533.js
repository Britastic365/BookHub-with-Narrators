window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Jayne Shepherd has spent his life blending in. He smiles. He laughs. He’s likeable. He’s also a sociopath. His emotions are limited. Love, fear, and desire don’t exist in his world. Until he meets Elijah.</p> <p>Elijah Dunne had everything. Third generation Hollywood royalty. Child star. Untouchable. Until one man ruined it all. Elijah fled LA to try to forget, but now, he’s back on top and back on a monster’s radar. Elijah doesn’t think he’ll ever feel safe. Until he meets Shepherd.</p> <p>Elijah and Shep only have one thing in common. They both wear masks. Shep makes Elijah feel protected. Seen. Elijah makes Shep just feel. Now that he’s had a taste, he’s not about to let him go. Everybody warns that what they have isn’t real. Shep is obsessed with Elijah, not in love. But Elijah craves Shep’s obsession. He can’t imagine life without him.</p> <p>In Hollywood, being a sociopath is more of a life skill than a diagnosis. Could Shep be the monster Elijah needs to finally slay his demons?</p> <p><i>Captivating</i> is the second book in the Elite Protection Services Series and contains age-gap, cum-play, voyeurism, and one very sexy interrogation scene with an HEA and no cliff-hangers.</p> <p><b>Warning: This book contains talk of past child sexual abuse.</b></p>";
