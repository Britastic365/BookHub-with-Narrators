window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Earth has been conquered. They will be, too.</b></p> <p>This box set brings together all four scorching-hot, savagely sexy books of the <i>Vakarran Captives</i> series. The set includes:</p> <p><b><i>Conquered</i></b></p> <p>I've lived in hiding since the Vakarrans arrived, helping my band of human survivors evade the aliens who now rule our world with an iron fist. But my luck ran out. Captured by four of their fiercest warriors, I know what comes next. They'll make an example of me, to show how even the most defiant human can be broken, trained, and mastered.</p> <p>I promise myself that I'll prove them wrong, that I'll never yield, even when I'm stripped bare, publicly shamed, and used in the most humiliating way possible. But my body betrays me. My will to resist falters as these brutes share me between the four of them, and I can't help but wonder if soon they will conquer my heart....</p> <p><b><i>Mastered</i></b></p> <p>First the Vakarrans took my home. Then they took my sister. Now, they have taken me. As a prisoner of four of their fiercest warriors, I know what fate awaits me. Humans who dare to fight back the way I did are not just punished, they are taught their place in ways so shameful I shudder to think about them.</p> <p>The four huge, intimidating alien brutes who took me captive are going to claim me in every way possible, using me more thoroughly than I can imagine. I despise them, yet as they force one savage, shattering climax after another from my naked, quivering body, I cannot help but wonder if soon I will beg for them to master me completely.</p> <p><b><i>Ravaged</i></b></p> <p>Though the aliens were the ones I always feared, it was my own kind who hurt me. Men took me captive, and it was four Vakarran warriors who saved me. But they don't plan to set me free. </p> <p>I belong to them now, and they intend to make me theirs more thoroughly than I can imagine. They are the enemy, and first I try to fight, then I try to run. But as they punish me, claim me, and share me between them, it isn't long before I am begging them to ravage me completely.</p> <p><b><i>Subdued</i></b></p> <p>The resistance sent them, but that's not really why these four battle-hardened Vakarrans are here. They came for me. To conquer me. To master me. To ravage me. To strip me bare, punish me for the slightest hint of defiance, and use my quivering virgin body in ways far beyond anything in even the very darkest of my dreams, until I've been utterly, completely, and shamefully subdued.</p> <p>I vow never to beg for mercy, but I can't help wondering how long it will be until I beg for more.</p> <p><b>Publisher's Note: The books of the </b><b><i>Vakarran Captives</i></b><b> series include spankings, sexual scenes, intense and humiliating punishments, and strong D/s themes. If such material offends you, please don't buy this box set.</b></p>";
