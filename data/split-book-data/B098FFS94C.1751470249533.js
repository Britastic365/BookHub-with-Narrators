window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Who can I trust?</b></p> <p><b>The City is thrown into chaos. The Dragonkeep isn’t far behind.</b></p> <p>When my mates and I took the Dragonkeep and I claimed my throne, it set into motion a chain of events I could never have foreseen. And the Void dragon asking for my protection says he knows my long-lost family. </p> <p>The mysterious new arrival tells me I’m half-Fae, half-dragon, and everyone’s enemy. I have to learn magic fast. If Ever is telling the truth - and that’s a big if, according to my other mates - all hell is about to crash down around my ears. There’s no choice but to leave the castle and venture into a new and dangerous world to find the truth about who I am. </p> <p>Nobody can teach me how to control my power. There’s never been someone like me before. But with every passing day, my magic grows stronger...until it threatens to blow up in my face and destroy the fragile resistance we’re building. Not to mention my other mates can’t stand Ever, and I’m not convinced they won’t sink their teeth into him the moment my back’s turned.</p> <p>There’s no rest for the wicked...and a lot of people think that’s me, just for being born. I can’t help who I am. But I can learn to defend myself, my dragons, and my world. It’s time to ride the perilous breezes of fate. </p> <p><b><i>Gale Force </i></b><b>is the second book in The Fae Dragon’s Harem, a paranormal reverse harem FMMMMM series containing MM scenes. Book three, </b><b><i>Heart’s Locke</i></b><b>, is already available. So scroll up, start listening now, and dive into a whole new world of magic, danger, and passion...and more hot dragon shifters than can ride one dragon. But they’ll sure as hell try.</b></p>";
