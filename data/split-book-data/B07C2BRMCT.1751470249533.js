window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>She’s got probable cause to make her move</i></b><b>....</b></p> <p>Danika Silva can’t stand Lt. Greer Burns. Her roommate’s older brother may be sexy as hell, but he’s also a cold, unfeeling robot. She just wants to graduate and forget about her scowling superior. But when a dangerous mistake lands Danika on probation - under Greer’s watch - she’s forced to interact with the big, hulking jerk. Call him daily to check in? Done. Ride shotgun in his cruiser every night? Done. Try not to climb into his giant, muscular lap and kiss him? <i>Umm</i>....</p> <p>Greer doesn’t let anything<i> - </i>or<i> anyone - </i>distract him from the job. Except lately, all he can think about is Danika. He’s wanted the beautiful, cocky recruit since the moment he saw her. But she’s reckless and unpredictable, and Greer is painfully aware of what can happen when an officer doesn’t follow the rules. Probation seemed like a good idea, but now Danika’s scent is in his car and he’s replayed her voicemails 20 times. <i>Christ,</i> he’s a goner.</p> <p>Danika’s melting Greer’s stone-cold exterior one ride-along at a time. Being together could have serious consequences...but breaking a few rules never hurt anybody, <i>right?</i></p>";
