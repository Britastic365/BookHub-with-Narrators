window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A reckoning is coming… but who will it hurt the most?</b></p> <p>When environmental activist Nova Morales wakes thousands of years after a nuclear fallout, she is surrounded by magic, monsters, and war. The earth she fought to protect is in pieces, along with her heart. Everyone she loved is dead. All she wants is to find answers, but instead, she finds herself the unwilling prize in an Unseelie mate hunt.</p> <p>Elf Guardian Leaf has always prioritized duty to the Well. His fate is his own, despite what the Prime and that insufferable psychic Clarke say about him being fated to a human from the old world. He doesn’t have time for love when a blight on their magic source has the enemy breathing down their necks. But when avoiding his duty throws him into the path of a beautiful war prize who claims they used to be lovers, he’s forced to question everything—even his memory.</p> <p>The trouble with questions is they lead to answers better left buried. And as more painful secrets come to light, Leaf starts to wonder who the truth will ruin most—the Prime with her machinations, the unhinged Unseelie Queen and her war of vengeance, the crow shifter with a chip on his wings, the lost daughter of an ally… or Nova, the woman he’s falling in love with.</p> <p><b><i>Book Nine in the Fae Guardians series features Leaf, the Cadre of Twelve team leader, and Nova Morales.</i></b></p>";
