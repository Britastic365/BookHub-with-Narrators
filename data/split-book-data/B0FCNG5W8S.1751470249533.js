window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I damned myself to save Angelo. One desperate deal with a demon lord, and now I'm dragged into the depths of Hell itself. But my vampire king's last words burn in my soul: Stay alive, and I will find you.</p> <p>Every hour in Hell's cruel court strips away pieces of my humanity, revealing powers that shouldn't exist in a mortal soul. The truth about my angelic father lies somewhere in these infernal depths, but the demon lord's games are pulling me deeper into darkness. My only defense is the volatile magic in my blood—a power caught between Heaven and Hell that could either save me or consume me.</p> <p>But I have to survive. Have to uncover the truth. Because Angelo isn't just any vampire king coming for me—he's carving a bloody path through Hell's nine circles, his empire is mobilizing to challenge powers as old as creation itself.<br> <br> They thought Hell's gates could keep us apart. They thought immortal power could break our bond. They're about to learn why even demons fear the French Quarter's most lethal vampire king.</p> <p>One promise keeps me fighting: Through hellfire and damnation, through torture and temptation, I know Angelo will tear apart the barriers between worlds to reclaim what's his….</p> <p>Me.</p> <p><i>The Curse of Blood and Vengeance</i> is the last book in the French Quarter Vampire King trilogy. Brace yourself for infernal bargains, soul-deep bonds, forbidden power, and a love so fierce it makes demons tremble.</p>";
