window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This 2-in-1 box set collects both installments in Liv Zander's Pale Court duet: King of Flesh and Bone and Queen of Rot and Pain. This duology is a dark-fantasy romance featuring a ruthless man, a woman who can't escape his love, and a Happily Ever After. </p> <p>This world contains dark themes, violence, loss, and elements of horror some may find disturbing. What this book doesn't contain is a heroâ€”because villains do it better.</p>";
