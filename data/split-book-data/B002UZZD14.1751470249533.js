window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Janet Evanovich is the hottest author in America, and her Stephanie Plum novels have taken the nation by storm!<br> <br> <b>#1 </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><br> <b>#1 </b><b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><br> <b>#1 </b><b><i>Los Angeles Times</i></b><br> <b>#1 </b><b><i>Entertainment Weekly</i></b><br> <b>#1 </b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br> <br> She's accidentally destroyed a dozen cars. She's a target for every psycho and miscreant this side of the Jersey Turnpike. Her mother's convinced she'll end up dead . . . or worse, without a man. She's Stephanie Plum, and she kicks butt for a living (well, she thinks it sounds good to put it that way. . . .).<br> <br> It begins as an innocent trip to the deli-mart, on a quest for nachos. But Stephanie Plum and her partner, Lula, are clearly in the wrong place at the wrong time. A robbery leads to an explosion, which leads to the destruction of yet another car. It would be just another day in the life of Stephanie Plum, except that she becomes the target of a gang—and of an even scarier, more dangerous force that comes to Trenton. With super bounty hunter Ranger acting more mysteriously than ever (and the tension with vice cop Joe Morelli getting hotter), she finds herself with a decision to make: how to protect herself and where to hide while on the hunt for a killer known as the Junkman. There's only one safe place, and it has Ranger's name all over it—if she can find it. And if the Junkman doesn't find her first. With Lula riding shotgun and Grandma Mazur on the loose, Stephanie Plum is racing against the clock in her most suspenseful novel yet. <i>Ten Big Ones</i> is thrilling entertainment, and Janet Evanovich is the best there is.</p>";
