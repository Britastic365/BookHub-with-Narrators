window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A standalone story in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> best-selling Shadow Beast Shifters world. Best heard after <i>Compelled</i> for storyline continuity.</p> <p>Samantha, of the Clarity shifters, has a secret. And it’s going to cost her everything.<br> <br> To save the most important person in her life, Samantha promises to form a mate bond with her pack’s future leader. If she can produce one heir, she’ll finally have her freedom.<br> <br> During the ceremony, the leader invokes the Shadow Beast’s name, calling the powerful and scary god right into their midst. A god with an even scarier mate. Mera, a shifter Samantha once counted as friend, never lets anything rest. She demands her secrets be revealed, and in doing so, uncovers a way to save them all from this fate.<br> <br> And it turns out that the Clarity pack leader isn’t Samantha’s greatest challenge.<br> <br> It’s one of Shadow's brothers: Len, prince of the Silver Lands. The fae, with the knowledge to save the one she cherishes above all others, forces Clarity to tie herself to him and Faerie.<br> <br> A world that she’s long feared. A world that could steal her heart.<br> <br> And her soul.<br> <br> If the prince doesn’t take them first.</p> <p>This is a standalone in the Shadow Beast world and does not end on a cliffhanger. It is advised to listen to the first five books in the Shadow Beast world first (<i>Rejected, Reclaimed, Reborn, Deserted, Compelled</i>) to get the most enjoyment from the story. Not required though. This is a forgotten-love story, with action, snark, anti-heroes, and steam. It is recommended for listeners 18 and up due to storyline and situations.</p>";
