window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Sometimes love is messy.</p> <p>In exchange for some witchy powers, Ashley promised the Devil her firstborn, but when the time comes to pay her due, she has nothing to give.</p> <p>With Lucifer insisting that she fulfill the terms of her contract, Ashley turns to Grim Dating for help. There’s only one problem - they’re having a hard time finding her perfect match.</p> <p>Which is where Derrick comes in.</p> <p>He’s the company’s problem solver; however, even he has no idea how to get a prim and proper witch to let loose. Frustration leads to him kissing her, but he never meant to seduce her...or fall in love.</p> <p>However, his witch isn’t interested in more than a one-night stand. And when an angel gets involved, the reaper realizes he’d best do a better job of sweeping Ashley off her feet.</p> <p>Or risk losing her forever.</p> <p>For more Hell books featuring Lucifer’s meddling, check out The Welcome to Hell series.</p>";
