window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Blaze has loved and lost before. He’s been down that slippery path and never wants to go there again...especially not with a human. </b></p> <p>It’s a great pity that he has no choice. The problem is that he’s the fire king, ruler of all four kingdoms. Blaze is expected to have heirs, and the sooner the better. He’ll have to take a human as his mate, one that will bear his young, but he doesn’t have to love her. Blaze plans on handling it like a business transaction. No love, no emotion, no problem.</p> <p><i>Dragon King</i> can be listened to as a standalone, but would be best enjoyed as book three of The Bride Hunt series.</p>";
