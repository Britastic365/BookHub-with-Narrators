window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Loving Echo Kent was painful. Not the falling in love part, that was easy. One look at the tall, blond-haired, blue-eyed narcotics detective, and I knew I wanted him. A few months later, I knew I couldn’t live without him. But my Echo had demons, secrets, and a mountain of guilt. His love was selfish and one-sided—he could love but he refused to allow others to love him. The closer I got, the harder he pushed me away. Yet, I was determined to make him face the demons that held him hostage.</p> <p>The fight was hard won, but I did it. I was well on my way to healing Echo’s fractured heart when someone from his past came raging into our lives threatening to blow up our perfect future.</p> <p>As the seconds tick and my death approaches, Echo has to make the impossible choice—me or his family.</p>";
