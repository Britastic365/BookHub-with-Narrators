window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Barbarian. Beast. Werewolf?</p> <p>In the space of twenty-four hours, my picture-perfect life has shattered to pieces.

But fate has other plans.</p> <p>I’ve been here all of five minutes when tall, dark, mysterious, and sexy comes stomping into my life–literally. Sutton Hargrave is the beginning of the end for me. An alpha with a predatory nature designed to push me away. But when the moon is full the pull between us is undeniable. Bewitched by our connection, I don't realize I'm in too deep until it's too late to escape.</p> <p>If you enjoy Jaymin Eve, Patricia Briggs, Ilona Andrews, Kelly St. Clare, Shannon Mayer, Leia Stone, Linsey Hall or slow-burn shifter romance, this is the series for you!</p>";
