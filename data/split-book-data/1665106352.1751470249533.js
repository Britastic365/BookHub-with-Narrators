window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>He’s a playboy rock star who needs a fake girlfriend. </b></p> <p><b>Except the only one available already stole his heart.</b></p> <p>Dash Kingston is living the rock ‘n’ roll dream. Fame, money, groupies, rolling up to red-carpet events in his baby, a Ferrari V12. Until a very <i>real</i> baby scare threatens to bring it all crashing down. Talk about a wake-up call. </p> <p>Dash knows things need to change. But to clean up his playboy image, he’s going to need help from the second-biggest mistake he ever made - a California blonde who blew his mind and left him with a scary case of the feels that sent him running. Now he needs a fake girlfriend, and she’s the perfect woman for the job. Not to mention time together will give him a chance to win her over. </p> <p>A few months ago, Dash offered a shoulder for Cassidy Forrester to cry on. Somehow, they wound up spending the night together. A night she thought meant something - until she woke up alone. She’s now serving as the band’s temporary personal assistant. But acting as Dash’s fake girlfriend is definitely <i>not</i> part of the job description.</p> <p>For the band’s sake, she agrees to play the role. But only a fool would make the same mistake twice, and Cassidy refuses to let their spark burn her a second time.</p>";
