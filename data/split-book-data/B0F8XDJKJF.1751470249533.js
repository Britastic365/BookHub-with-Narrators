window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Sometimes the best things in life <i>pop up</i> out of nowhere.</p> <p>Danielle:</p> <p>I’m not looking for a man, let alone a baseball player. Definitely not a minor leaguer who doesn’t even know how to pick a steamed crab. This is North Bay. Baseball and crabbing are a way of life. This town is in my blood, it’s where I belong. Mike Miller showed up with his big dreams of signing with a better team, and he already has one foot out the door. I don’t want a man who won’t stay. I’ve had enough of those. So, why can’t I get him out of my head?</p> <p>Mike:</p> <p>I need to keep my head in the game and my butt out of trouble, but I can’t seem to do either of those things around her. There’s too much riding on this season, I can’t afford to be held back. But Danielle makes me feel like I am worth something, and North Bay is starting to feel like home. Those are things I haven’t had for a long time. Too bad I’m not the kind of guy who deserves them.</p> <p><b>Out of Left Field is Book 1 in the North Bay series. This is a standalone baseball romance with mild-to-medium heat.</b></p>";
