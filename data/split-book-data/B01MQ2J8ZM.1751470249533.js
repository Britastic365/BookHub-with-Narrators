window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>All Pyper Rayne - medium and coffee shop owner - wanted was the perfect vintage dress. What she got was a dead shop owner and a sexy ghost who's suddenly everywhere - at her shop, in her car, and even lounging in her bedroom. But he's not just any ghost. He's a witch and able to appear in solid form...sometimes. If only he'd stop disappearing on her. </p> <p>And Pyper needs his help. When she becomes target <i>numero uno</i> and the prime suspect in the shop owner's death, it appears her ghost holds the key to solving the murder. In between stolen kisses, Pyper will need to get to the bottom of all of his secrets if she wants to stay alive and out of jail...and maybe finally get that date he keeps promising her. </p>";
