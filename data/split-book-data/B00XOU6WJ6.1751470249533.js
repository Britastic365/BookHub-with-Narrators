window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Rebellious Julian Fortescue never expected to inherit a dukedom nor to find himself guardian to three young half sisters. Now in the market for a governess, he lays eyes on Jane Grey and knows immediately that she is qualified to become his mistress. Yet the alluring woman appears impervious to him. </p> <p>Lady Jeanne de Falleron didn't seek a position as a governess simply to fall into bed with the duke of Denford. Under the alias of Jane Grey, she must learn which of the duke's relatives is responsible for the death of her family - and take her revenge. She certainly can't afford the distraction of her darkly irresistible employer or the smoldering desire he ignites within her. </p> <p>But as Jane discovers more clues about the villain she seeks, she's faced with a possibility more disturbing than her growing feelings for Julian: What will she do if the man she loves is also the man she's sworn to kill? </p> <p>Contains mature themes. </p>";
