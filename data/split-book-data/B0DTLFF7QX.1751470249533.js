window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Archer: I am my own God and martyr. I fear no evil. The shadow is mine, and so is the valley. All power demands sacrifice, and I will take what is mine in fire and blood. Starting with Mila...My dark angel, come to deliver me from the pits of Hell. I will baptize in her blood and consecrate the ground with her screams. She will be mine in this life and the next—her name on my lips when my demons drag me into the flames. </p> <p>Mila: The Devil is real. And he's not a little red man with horns and a tail. He is beautiful—an enigma. What we are doing is sick, but no one else touches me like he does. I want to run from the darkness that consumes my soul, but in the dark, he's there. My fallen angel.</p> <p>Waiting with open arms, welcoming me to Hell. In his embrace, I feel whole. We sin as devils do. We love as angels do...I bind myself to you. My body. My mind. My soul. I am yours, and you are mine. If death comes for me, I shall wait for you. We shall not part in this life or the next.</p> <p>Vivamus, moriendum est.</p>";
