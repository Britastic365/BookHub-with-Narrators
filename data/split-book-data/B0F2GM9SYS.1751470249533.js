window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A crown I don't want. A bargain I can't take back. A life I refuse to sacrifice. After four hundred years on my own, one would think I'd be able to walk away and never look back. I'd done it a thousand times before with nary an inkling of guilt. But with my brand new predicament, there is no way I can turn down the offered bargain—not if I want everyone I love to stay alive.</p> <p></p> <p>Now, all I have to do is trek through the very realm I nearly died to keep sealed. Sure. Because there's no way that could go wrong.</p> <p></p> <p>Unseelie Court, here I come.</p> <p></p> <p>Queen of Fate &amp; Fire is the final book in the Rogue Ethereal series. If you enjoy foul-mouthed heroines, dark humor, and enemies-to-lovers, then you'll love this series.</p>";
