window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>He would stop at nothing to have her, but would her heart survive loving a sin?</i></b></p> <p>Being the archangel of selflessness got me kicked out of my home. I’d spent my entire existence guiding those to give of themselves and help their fellow angels. Even when Lucifer marched on Heaven’s gate, I once more attempted to get those I called family to see a better way. Sadly, Father didn’t see that and I was cast out of Heaven to be forever be trapped on Earth or worse in Hell.</p> <p>If Father wanted to cast me out and turn me into this symbol, the Sin of Greed, I would not only accept the challenge as Riker, I’d own it.</p> <p>And then I met her and the world once more shifted beneath my feet.</p> <p>Minetta wanted nothing more than to have a normal life and do something that made her feel proud. Working as a 911 operator gave her that feeling, but there was always something missing from her life. Until one day, she unwittingly became the pawn in a chess match she never knew existed.</p> <p>A deadly war was brewing, one that had been waged for centuries and could mean the end for humanity. Pulled into the middle of this tug-of-war, she met him, Riker. The man was imposing, but the Sin under the sexy exterior was terrifying, and yet her heart still pounded hard when he was near.</p> <p>Could Minetta have love and save the human race, or would she end up having to choose?</p>";
