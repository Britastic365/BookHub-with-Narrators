window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It's time to settle an ancient score. My human father has returned from the grave. He tried to kill me after I became a vampire. He intends to finish the job. But that's the least of my problems.</p> <p>Someone else brought him back. Who would do something like that? All I know is that whoever it is wants me dead. I intend to spoil his plans.</p> <p><i>Bloody Retribution</i> is the third book in The Fury of a Vampire Witch. You've met Mercy before in <i>The Legacy of a Vampire Witch</i> and The Blood Witch Saga. She's fought against devils and demons, insidious witches, and old-world vampires. When she returns to Exeter, where she grew up as a girl, she'll find enemies even bigger and badder than anything she's ever faced before.</p> <p>A great series for fans of the <i>True Blood</i>/Sookie Stackhouse novels or the Underworld franchise to sink their fangs into. The Fury of a Vampire Witch features a dark and twisty romance, action that could even get a vampire's heart pumping, and a snarky badass heroine.</p>";
