window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Can he save her from his mistakes?</p> <p>Not much bothers Wes Carter. Not the rotation of girls in his bed. Not the promotion he was supposed to get a year ago. Not even the new packmate he can’t take his eyes off. At least, that’s what he tells himself. Truth is, no one’s ever affected him the way this beautiful but strange woman does, and he plans to find out why.</p> <p>As an orphan, Emily King has lost a lot in her life. So when she finds out the family she nannies for is taking a permanent vacation in Iceland, she’s not even surprised. She’s used to no one sticking around for long. With no job or place to live, she joins her brother’s pack hoping for a fresh start. But what she finds is more family than she knows what to do with, and a weird connection with one packmate in particular.</p> <p>When a simple drink turns dangerous, Wes is finally forced to care about something: protecting Emily. She’s caught in the eye of this storm, and the fallout could be deadly. Can Wes save her from his past? Or is he doomed to lose the first woman he’s ever loved?</p> <p>This book contains sexual themes and violence that is intended for audiences 18 and older.</p>";
